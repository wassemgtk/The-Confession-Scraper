I'm posting this here because You said you were from UC Berkeley. First of all, you're supposed to be asking for donations, not pressuring people to squeeze their wallets for you. 2nd, You humiliated me on the train right after I refused to donate and branded me as ""someone programmed to society."" When I told you ""im not from around here,"" you completely ignored what I said and insulted me in public. Your attitude disgusts me, and I hope you realize it yourself before it becomes a big problem for you.

496760523694278_691557627547899,"I've been studying all night for my 8 AM final. A couple minutes ago I realized that I needed a little study/pee break, so I went into the bathroom and took care of my business. Then I realized I was slightly horny and wasn't quite ready to go back to work, so I went back into the handicapped stall, whipped out da Hub on my cellular phone. Once I had found a vid of some German milf blowing ""police officers,"" I pulled out my Johnson and started beating the monkey. It is important to note that I have my peen in one hand and my phone in the other. Its slightly precarious, but I make it work. After a couple minutes, the video started getting weird (those Germans :/) so I decided I should switch it up a little. I went back to the home page and skipped through a couple pages, found something that looked suitable for the job, and went back to it. The video started a little slow though, so I repositioned my grip with my phone hand so that I could move the video ahead a bit. My phone started to slip out of my hand, headed directly for the disgusting handicapped toilet bowl. *GASP!!* I squirmed to save my phone and just in time juggled it against my body, pressing it into my chest. Safety. I regained composure, carefully skipped the video ahead past the opening credits, and continue with the deed. When I came, it was the sweet, victorious cum of a man who had stared doom strait in the face and won. At that moment, like Andy Dufresne, I could have crawled through a quarter mile of shit and come out a clean man. Plus, my phone still works and isn't covered in toilet water!
In related news, I am stoked to be moving out of the dorms in 4 days! #tp",,status,,2014-05-13 00:32:20,52,26,1
496760523694278_690522080984787,"Seeing people save spots in Main Stacks with their books/notes for extended periods of time makes me absolutely sick. Its a tragedy of the commons situation - individual selfishness and greed makes life difficult for everybody. 

If nobody saved spots, there would be plenty of spaces to go around all the time, so nobody would worry about saving spots. But since some assholes decide to save spots, space is limited and so people who ordinarily would not save a place will do so because if they do not they worry they won't have a place to study later. 

To fix a tragedy of the commons situation, you've gotta impose risks and disincentives to make most people avoid being shitheads. So from now on I'm gonna be the Stacks Batman:

Be warned, assholes of stacks, if I'm sitting at a table, and you leave and don't come back for over an hour, I'm gonna hide your things. Simple as that. Let this be a warning to everyone who uses stacks. In fact, I'll probably send pictures of the things I've taken and hidden to UCB confessions, with name and personal info exposed, so that we all can see who the assholes of stacks are.

The lack of fun, the awkward people, the dangerous streets, and the ridiculous grade inflation and competition (from all the pre-Haas, pre-meds, etc.) all have me regretting my choice to have come to this school.

However, I realize that I am chasing my dreams here. Berkeley was the school I wanted to go to since I was 7—before I understood anything about college rankings and Nobel prizes—and that dream is being achieved. I may be struggling in classes and some nights, I may be lonelier than I want to admit, but I'm proud to be here. I'm proud to go to other states and countries and tell people: ""I go to UC Berkeley"" and see the awe shine in their faces. I'm proud to be a part of a campus that's notorious for civil rights rallies, marijuana, and a phenomenal arts scene.
When it comes down to it, I got here to this point in my life—higher than 90% of the world could even imagine of rising to—and I may have some bad grades but I also have spectacular ones, and those are what I should be proud of. I don't always feel at place here but I feel lucky to even be considered a Berkeley student. And I wouldn't have it any other way.",,status,,2014-05-07 15:37:01,280,17,0

But I noticed a peculiar person. An a tight young asian girl with firm b-cup titties, and a bubble butt. She was adorable and I marveled at her naked body as I video taped her running across the room. Just as she and her friends left, I went over and grabbed her clothes.

I immediately licked her g-string and stuffed it into my pocket. I took her bra, her t-shirt, and her shorts and shoved them into my backpack, and then I waited for the nudists to return.

She eventually returned but spent about 20 minutes looking for her stuff, while I recorded her naked body from a distance. A video I still jerk off to to this day. 

She gave up and one of her friends gave her a t shirt and some underwear and she began her humiliating walk home. Little did she know that I still have her underwear and I sniff them as much as I can.

Grading down to encourage higher quality work (when the work is absolutely fine) is abusive and unfair.

You're not encouraging students to do better when you make them feel inadequate because you have self esteem issues. Stop acting like you're some hot shit. You're not. Given, you may know a lot - and thats great! But being a dick about it, makes you hated across campus.

A semester at Berkeley 
It's been quite a ride
But finals are here
And there's nowhere to hide

The time now has come
To reflect on the year
On essays, and asians
And truckloads of beer 

Gettin frisky at the Coops 
Blacking out at SAE 
Trying coke for the first time
Cause how bad could it be?

Gameday turnup 9 am
Lookin for conquest 
Drunken hookup with a 9
But a sober 4 at best  

Dinner at Asian ghetto
Hobos on the prowl 
Thank Jesus for Berkeley time 
But fuck flyers on Sproul

Vitali flows like waterfalls
Cheep beer like a river 
We've got giant brains goddamit
Who needs a fucking liver

Through cold-ass fucking winters
And heart crushing breakups
Through late nights at the Library 
And phone-alarm wakeups

Through all of the trauma 
Of that hard Berkeley Grind 
A semester at Berkeley
Is the best you can find 

So here's to the fall
And the coming Spring months
And prepare for more fun

I understand that we don’t all come from similar backgrounds here and maybe things were tight for you. I get that, I really do. Quite honestly, I most likely wouldn’t have been angry if you had taken the $40 cash and just given me at least my room keys and Cal1Card. What I don’t understand is why you didn’t stop to think that maybe this decision wouldn’t just affect you. I hope you know that you making the conscious decision to take my wallet and everything in it not only ruined my day and any chances of studying for finals, but it had a negative impact on most people around me. My parents had to deal with my constant upset phone calls while they were trying to work, my roommate and suitemate had to take time out of their schedule to be available and let me in my own room, my friends had to deal with my bad mood, and the girls in my sorority house had to deal with the noise of me angrily trying to cancel my credit/debit cards as they were trying to study for finals. And not only did your conscious decision have a negative impact on these people, you made sure that I wouldn’t have a positive impact on others. When I woke up this morning, I was convinced I was going to have a good day. Who knows, maybe I would have given a homeless man some spare change or swiped hungry students in with the ID that you took from me, or even just smiled at people walking down the street and brightened their day. But you made sure this didn’t happen. So next time you find someone’s wallet on the ground, think twice about who you are really affecting when you have that choice to make. 
Sincerely, 
Everyone who could have had a good day",,status,,2013-12-13 16:45:38,82,10,0

Crammed cafes and library dates, Regretting the days that you slept in late While out on the campus there struck a big nerve, Of Asian kids sprinting to mess up the curve. The readings you ignored piled up to the ceiling; Our asses are saved by Wikipedia stealing. Time home for thanksgiving was a bittersweet tease, Come back to find college screwing you on your knees. Facebook and Twitter prove a hefty temptation, Earning your citizenship in the procrasti-NATION Exams handed out, the questions complex; Pray that it’s over like a night of bad sex Eyes begin wandering while we’re crammed in our seats; That one kid is dragged out for trying to cheat Smelly dude next to me, chill bro you’re fine!

I was blacked out only knew I brought you home because my house-mate saw you on your way out in the morning. I found 2 condoms a couple feet from my trashcan when I finally managed to shake of that raging headache and get out of bed. I also found almost all of the lube in my dresser drawer on my sheets and surrounding the bottle on my floor. I literally have no idea what happened, but I thought your name was Laura or Lauren or something like that. I think I got your number, but since I don't know your name, looking though my contacts list doesn't help much. 

I you remember who I am, and you somehow happen to still have my number, you should hit me up. As fun as it is to not remember a night of nailing a hot sorority girl in my apartment, next time (if there is a next time) I hope we can do it pre-alcohol poisoning? I think some people here would call that rape, but I won't judge you that harshly. With the amount of lube missing from my bottle, I can only hope that we did anal, or at least something crazy. 

Let me know if we can make this work again.

Also, I VERY SLIGHTLY remember you saying something about a boyfriend to me last night. If you are currently in a relationship, I'd call you a pretty fucked up person. But I guess as the old saying goes, if someone's already got dibs on the pussy, just fuck the ass.

I didn't do a good enough job branching out at the beginning of the year (due to just sticking with my now ex), and now that my friendship with someone that I considered my bro has been compromised, I feel as though I have next to no where to turn.

I sometimes start walking to campus for lecture, but then after noticing a pretty, smiling girl, I turn around and slink back to my room inexplicably demotivated.

496760523694278_616512765052386,"Ever like a shy guy? I'm pretty quiet and shy (to a point that my RA forgot that I even existed) and I have never been in a relationship (or for the most part, had girls notice me)
People talk about having 20,30 girlfriends (some of whose names they don't remember anymore) and having had sex with atleast twice as many more, and I am jealous of that. I hate to admit it, but I am. I guess that makes me a pervert for wanting to have sex, but so be it. But alas! I've never even known what a kiss felt like, let alone, sex.

I really want to change that. I do, honestly. I want to be that loud, cool, funny kid that gets tons of attractive girls. And I try - I do! - I try to go to parties and drink and meet people and be social, but no matter what, I feel really awkward when I try to do that, partially due to my own physical insecurities (terrible teeth, glasses, slightly overweight [although I have been working on that; lost about 15 pounds in 3 months :S], etc.), and partially due to constant rejection at any attempt to attract a girl. No matter what I do, I always end end up being the guy who makes the girl[s] breakfast and takes them home in the morning, rather than the guy who actually brings them home in the first place. I try to act like it doesn't phase me - i even made up a bullshit story to my roommates about trying to be abstinent so that they don't feel sorry for my lack of sexual activity - but the truth is: I really want to be the guy that girls find attractive and dream about. I want to be that guy girls yearn a text from and talk to their friends about. I was that guy who makes girl's stomachs fills with butterflies when they perceive me. I want to be that guy: somebody who exists only in my fantasies, someone who I can never be in real life, despite my best attempts. Someone who girls will never see anything for except a nice guy and perhaps, slightly intelligent. They say nice guys do win - in the end. But I'm tired of waiting, and I have this incredible penchant to losing. Unlike most of my friends and people I hang out with, I'm not going to know what sexual selection means, I'm not going to have the choice of playing the ""dating"" game, and I'm probably to end up marrying the first girl that actually pays attention to me. And this thought is KILLING me inside. 

And please don't say any of that - don't worry, you'll find someone!, etc, etc, bullshit, bullshit. That's like telling the limit of n as it approaches infinity, ""oh, don't worry! You'll find an integer someday!""

Please don't get into a relationship for the wrong reasons! Love comes naturally, and love is when you care about someone, pretty cliché right? Well, the truth is love is when you feel that way about a person. You want to make her smile, make her happy, hear her laugh, hear her voice, and have her presence around you. So.. in a sense you don’t ever look for a relationship to be happy, you get into a relationship when you feel that strongly about someone. So if you’re thinking, I’m lonely, I’m horny, I want someone there for me, you’re only thinking about yourself and not someone else, a relationship isn’t for you. Love is selfless, so if someone is there for you and you’re only thinking about how you can benefit, that person truly loves you.  Because of all the pain you’ve caused them, all the aguish about caring about yourself, and they’re still there because you’re happy.

That’s when you love someone, and even if those feelings are softened over time, it’s how you get soften the falls and work as a team to build it back up. People love not for themselves, but for the ones they love.

Eh, I guess I get some-what philosophical in the shower. But sadly, even if you do truly care about someone, they still might not feel the same way about you.

You have never worn a lover’s sweater or “forgotten” it at home in your bedroom just so you would have an excuse to see them again. You have never even stood face-to-face with someone who makes your hands shake so hard it feels like they’re both having a separate anxiety attack.
This causes you much guilt and self-blame and sadness but above all, an overwhelming curiosity. Are you really that ugly, that unwanted, that uninteresting, that boring, that no one, absolutely no one, has ever looked at you like the only thing on earth?
The answer is no. The better answer is that someone out there, somewhere in the world, is “wondering what it’s like to meet someone like you,” and they have two decades worth of love stored in their veins like a shoot-‘em-up drug, and they’re just about ready to inject it into someone else’s bloodstream. All you have to do is roll up your sleeves and wait for it to happen.
At times you felt so lonely you could stand at the edge of a cliff with nothing beneath you but air and grass and a long, long way down, and you’d still feel emptier than that canyon itself. Maybe you even danced with yourself alone in your room a few times, arms outstretched around a ghost, pretending someone else’s hands were on your waist, someone else’s eyes boring into yours.
Or maybe you fell temporarily in love with strangers on public transportation, fell in love with anybody who so much as accidentally brushed your hand on the way past. For you, falling in love with dozens of people a day was a coping mechanism for not having anyone to love you in return. But people are not eggs and falling in love with a dozen of them does not mean your shell will remain uncracked. One day you’re going to hit the point where you’re so desperate for human contact that you’re going to snap in half and all your love will bleed out like egg yolk.
But someone out there is eating a bowl of Ramen noodles right now, or putting on slippers, or settling into bed. They are doing all the normal things that you’ve done in your own life. They are just like you. They have cellulite and extra fat in all the wrong places and goals and fears and doubts and bad handwriting.
The truth is that they are just like you, and being just like you, they’re looking for a lover too. They’re what you might call a soulmate.
They think they’re all alone in feeling the way they do, but you’re really both two halves of a whole.
And one day you’ll meet them, bump into them on the street, and your two halves will be put together, and you’ll make one.",,status,,2013-11-25 14:25:47,201,12,2

496760523694278_616023768434619,"Last year, as a freshman, I was oh so young. I didn't know anything about the world, or let alone myself for that matter. By chance, I met a guy at this club meeting — you know, the earlier ones of the semester with all the ice-breakers, the awkward obligatory handshakes. It wasn't just any club meeting, though. It was safe space for queer people to meet and interact. I went alone without any expectations set, but as soon as I stepped through the doors of Dwinelle, my eyes gazed upon whom I once thought was the most handsome guy I had ever seen. 

I approached him. 
I asked him for his name. 
He asked me mine.
We talked more and more, and before we knew it, the entire night was gone. Sparks flew, and one might even say that it was love at first sight. I had finally met a guy who I found attractive, funny, and just like me. My sheltered, inexperienced self felt empowered by the very idea of finding someone special. And things went from there.

We ended up dating for 8 months. Man, we were in love. Many of those who knew of our relationship loved us together, and we even molded the minds of those who had very rigid images of gay people. Those 8 months were some of the best times I ever had. That's what I thought at the time, anyway. 

But after a petty tiff one night, he completely changed as a person. He stopped texting me, talking to me, hugging and kissing me... He no longer wanted to associate with me or my friends. When I packed my bags to go home after my last final exam in May, we kissed and cried together in the dorm stairwell. A week later, he gave me that dreadful call.

From yesterday, it has been 6 months since he broke up with me. Even to this day, I'm not sure what happened to him. Even though he has hurt (and still hurts) me so much, I care a lot about him.

When I look back, I realize how blinded I was. I projected a perfect, immaculate facade onto him, when in reality, he was a twisted, profane, immature, cowardly, lazy, depressed, and immoral person. However, I only realize these things in hindsight.

This is my main takeaway message: there is so much for you to learn from within yourself before you can even imagine looking beyond. We often think too much about others, especially when it comes to relationships. But we are all so young, and believing that we'll meet that special someone in college is unrealistic and overly idealistic. People are too complicated and impulsive at this age to know what they really want. However, to those who have found their companions, I wish you the very best. You're probably experiencing something very special.

And to all those gay guys who may feel closeted and unsure of things: don't get bogged down. If you've ever visited Grindr or Jack'd, those apps are crawling with sex addicts and people who don't give a shit about your feelings. If that's what you want, then more power to you! Have sex, meet randos from the street across yours. But you don't HAVE to live that life. Make strong friendships, be around those who matter, and have a good time here. 

You really do discover a lot about yourself in this high-strung, relentless, drug-infested place many of us call home. Thanks a ton, Cal.

Sincerely,
Your loving, pseudo-closeted gay friend",,status,,2013-11-24 22:35:48,73,6,2

Last night, I was walking back to Bowles, and I saw 3-4 people next to this black Subaru, and they kept flashing their headlights at me. I was confused and didn't really know what to do..I started walking a little bit more quickly until one of them (tall, in-shape??, 20ish years old) started approaching me briskly. Being the dumbass I am, I stopped and asked the guy what he needed. His buddy came charging at me with a bat and looked like he was going to fucking swing me. Luckily, I pulled the bat away, gave the guy a right hook and Zab Judah legs.. and his friends ran back in the car and drove off quickly..
I looked at the unconscious body...and I tried looking for a driver's license. Nothing. A Cal Card? Nope. He was completely clean of any form of ID. I called my roommates and they laughed at me and didn't believe me..so the last thing I did was call my mom. After I told her the story, she started bawling on me and got scared and said, “You’re movin’ with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air.” I whistled for a cab and when it came near The license plate said fresh and it had dice in the mirror If anything I could say that this cab was rare But I thought, “Nah, forget it.

Sometimes, deep down, I think of wanting to be put in some kind of prolonged dangerous situation, or sad circumstance, or some kind of arduous video-game like journey with friends, and then overcome it together. I just think it's... a beautiful thing, to be able to overcome the danger, the sadness, the obstacles, together with your friends beside you. In so doing, those bonds shine brighter, you understand each other more, and you know you can always count on each other for support. I know it's bad of me to think this way, since of course I don't want my friends to suffer or anything, but at the same time, I just think it'd be a very... human thing. To be there for each other during not only the happy, fun times, but also the sad, dangerous times... to go through together opposing sides of the spectrum of the human experience - happiness and sorrow, peace and danger, light and darkness - isn't that a beautiful thing...? Being there for each other only during the happy times, and not the sad times... that's not what friends are for, is it?

496760523694278_616022925101370,"I'm really bothered by the steady increase of suspicious people around campus and south side. It's not just all the armed robberies that are up by around 100% since last year, but also just seeing all the suspicious looking people hanging/driving around campus who clearly don't go to Cal and are clearly up to no good.

I'm not bothered as a person scared of being victimized. I'm annoyed as a much bigger than average guy who doesn't leave his house without a large pocket knife, who doesn't want the day to come that he has to hurt someone while protecting himself or one of his friends.

Really, I am not confident in UCPD. The few experiences I have had with them were bad. The worst of which and most recent was overhearing one of them making fun of an international student and telling his colleague the kid's English was so bad that he just gave up trying to understand him and wrote scribbles on the police report, and then saying something to the likes of it doesn't matter because no one actually looks at the police reports anyways.

I think that part of my tuition is going to afford me a quality of education that at least lets me feel safe when I am walking less than a mile from home to campus. UCPD officers certainly make more than the large majority of Cal graduates, if their compensation is exemplary shouldn't their performance follow suite? 

Am I the only one who doesn't have confidence in UCPD or the current state of campus safety?",,status,,2013-11-24 22:31:18,21,1,1

But just once, I wish hot girls would be into the intellectual and deep shit too. Sure, I've found girls that DO want to talk about life and our role here, etc, etc, but more often than not, they're usually not as attractive or outgoing as the party-type girls. (btw, I should really write an algorithm on this later: the correlation between girls that party and intellectuals) But yeah, moral of the story: if you're hot, don't be afraid to ""downplay"" yourself and try to be intellectual!

Yesterday, on 11-22 at about noon-ish-1ish my friends and I were standing by the table that was selling the StanfUrd shirts and as a joke I told my friend to yell out to people to buy the shirts to help our other friend out. She yelled out to you, saying, ""You should buy this shirt, you'll look beautiful in it"" to which you responded with a smile. You were the only person to respond in a friendly manner and to top it off you had a beautiful smile. Thanks for being friendly and flashing us a smile and on  that note I'd love to be friends :) It's nice seeing friendly people on campus. <- take note Cal kids!

496760523694278_615543431815986,"It may be been 2 years ago I noticed it. My drinking become a problem. I knew my point of handling alcohol but I always pushed past it, always knowing it too; I made an effort to push it. Then sleeping with strange men (4 total), I would always make sure I was drunk beforehand. Every weekend I had to have a drink. Whenever I went out, I had to drink something. Then the hurtful words starting coming. I began to say terrible things to the people I loved. The blackout moments became more frequent. So last year, I made an effort to stop.

I gave in saying ""It's okay, I can have one or a few."" I stopped pushing that point of getting 'shitfaced'. I've limited myself to only 2 at most. 

The part that makes me want to cry is no matter how hard I try, whenever I see someone with beer or go into a restaurant that has a bar I hear a little voice in my head saying ""Do it, it's just one drink."" When someone offers me a beer, it's literally a fight inside me that says no and when I do, I have a lingering of regret because it's only one drink. Between Thursday and Saturday I think about it. I'm afraid to go out with friends because of that feeling and knowing alcohol will be readily available. 

I want to cry because I can't go out with friends without fighting myself inside to merely say no. I keep myself inside and as far away from parties or outings just so I don't have to say no. It hurts because I'm keeping myself from so many dinners and get togethers.

Now, I'm giving in. I can't fight this alone because I'm missing parts of my life because of the urge to drink. I want help but I don't know where to start. I'm going to graduate so I won't have access to tang so I don't know where to go. What am I going to do?

Planned obsolescence. Proprietary designs with the intent to exploit and hurt targeted groups of people. Corporate shuttles and the gentrification of neighborhoods. Racism, sexism, and all that other bad stuff. I may not understand it completely, but I was never exposed to this side of engineering before. Selfishness in design. Complete disregard for just everything in general. In the past I’ve only read about it. Never have I had to experience it first-hand. This is why I’m disheartened. 

Just this week I’ve read stories on people being injured or even killed because of thefts of things like iPhones or nice cars. Or lines to get the new this or that; the people who have and those who don’t, not because of money, but because of supply. The people who have waited their entire lives to get some thing only to be price-gouged at the last minute or artificially-reduced supply. A system I will be contributing to for selfish interest.

Just looking at some of the price gouging on the Free and For Sale page makes me sad that people are doing this kind of stuff and I wonder if they realize all the people they are disappointing. At this point I’m just rambling but my greatest fear as an engineer is that lose control of what I make to the selfish and greedy who will use it to hurt others, to disappoint others, and to exploit others for personal gain.

Every Friday between 10-1030 (the only time I know my roommate is gone for sure) I get out my hairbursh from under my bed and dip it in a jar of honey.  Once its nice and lathered up I then roll it in trail mix until it has a nice coating.  I then sneakily go down to the unit kitchen and microwave it for a good 10-15 mins.  (sorry if youve had to wait on me there but this shit is important to me)  Once prepared I bring the brush back up to my room and lather its now bumpy wax-like exterior in a Teriyaki/A-1 marinade until its glistening all around.  After thats done I wrap it entirely in double sided tape and then roll the sticky exterior in some cajun trail mix (real cayenne pepper).  I then proceed to vigorously plunge it into my anus and remove it each time with a twisting motion.  I usually bite down on a sweaty sock to keep my suitemates from hearing my gasps of pleasure.  When I'm near an anal queef I give it one last good plunge and then force myself to sneeze while I yank it out as hard and as viciously as I can.  Once the  deed has been done (and we're approaching the 1030 mark) I drop the brush into the clothing donation bin outside my unit.

So I just wanted to post this so you know that its not weird and that you're not alone.  There's power in numbers!  :)",,status,,2013-11-22 18:23:32,3,2,0
496760523694278_615119711858358,"From someone who just landed an $80k+ salary from a ""stupid humanities"" major, here is some real talk:
1. If you are in a major that is not inherently credible for the work force, accept it. Get the baseline GPA that you need for people not to gloss over your resume and don't worry about fighting for incremental increases. That's not what helps. Besides the sciences, very few doors are immediately closed for you just because of the name of your major.
2. Kill it on extracurriculars and work experience. Absolutely try for everything you can get, while being unique. Look for things abroad, for example. You can score paid internships in different parts of the world because you know English. That will make you stand out. Learn new skills like web design or how to use statistical databases. You need to stuff your resume with things that prove that you're more than your major.
3. You can get the best of both worlds--preserve that high GPA you get from humanities and get a good salary to set yourself up for the future.
pi. EECS kids can go suck it.
4. If you can, spend your senior year taking classes that don't require attendance, so you can interview for more positions and build skills. Fortunately, many humanities classes accommodate this handsomely.
5. Nothing you learn in your classes will actually help you. Legal/paralegal jobs don't use anything you learn in Legal Studies. Political jobs will almost never use anything you learn in Political Science. Stop using these degrees to advertise yourself in the workforce. Use your skill set to do so.",,status,,2013-11-22 18:23:17,97,3,1

They were too drunk from the party last night and I took them home, made sure they were okay and slept on the floor. I quickly made some old fashioned ihop breakfast for them and got some of my old clothes cause there was puke on theirs. Leaving both those things and a note on the table, I quickly left as they were waking up. I took the stairs down so the elevator wouldn't have to stop on my floor and make other people late; besides, a good morning exercise is good for you. I take my old cheapy bike and head over to the RSF. Along the way I spot a homeless person and gave him the extra breakfast I made for myself and my gym clothes I was going to change out of. He needed it more than me. When I entered, the room scent didn't change at all. I try to do my usual routine lifting and try to fit it in a hour cause hey, it's pretty optimal and so I don't hog the barbell. I made a 20 lb progress on my deadlift and was pretty proud. On the way back to the locker room, I helped a guy out who was struggling with the bench. I asked to work in with him and spot him even though I didn't plan on working chest today. I didn't want him to get hurt though. We have a solid workout and exchanged numbers so he doesn't have to bench alone next time.
I looked up, and sure enough this really cute girl was coming towards me. When i say cute, I mean that girl seemed like she loved her family, studied hard, and treated everyone around her really nicely. She asked to use the machine I was on and I delightfully obliged. I walked back to the locker room and didn't ask for her number because I respect that she was just there to workout and not get hit on. As I was about to leave I see her again getting hit on by a sleazy guy and clearly uncomfortable. I proceeded to pretend to be gay and hit on the guy and making him feel queasy. She thanked me and I left before we could talk more, she thinks Im gay but no biggie. 
 I left the gym and found my bike, which I purposely don't lock, gone. Hey, if you're desperate enough to steal, go ahead. I know a friend who knows a bike shop and I get them for really cheap anyway. On the way back I see another hobo, give him a couple dollar bills and a piece of paper that directs him to the nearest homeless shelter.

496760523694278_614227898614206,"I need some legitimate and serious mental help.
One of my dearest and sincere friends has helped me realize that I am my own enemy.
When persuing the change one wants in life, the first step is to act upon it.
But I find myself completely unable to get past step one. 
My fear and anxiety of reprocussions and negative impacts freeze me in my path.
People like to point out that we only live once, so that we should take any chance regardless. All that supportive talk never gets into my head.
I feel as if every piece of helpful advice ever given could be represented as the best armor-penetrating bullet in the world, but it will never crack past my 100% damage/bullet-proof skull.
And every day, the more I even have the slightest though about my future, the more I think about the worst that could happen to me. 
Somehow, my mind switches into complete pessimist mode. (And no, Im dont cut my wrists or physically harm meself.)
What is also really hard to cope with is living up to the reputation that I never asked for. All the false hope that I was given back in highschool from all my supportive peers, and all the supportive families back home, it all amounts to nothing when I can't even fathom the idea of making someone out of myself. 
These problems of mine have only started to affect me when I started college last fall. I entered Berkeley believing that I would succeed in my intended major, only to find out how I couldnt keep up with the workload.
My father, who lately has been abusing his meds due to his surgery from years ago, has become a dictator. Every day I feel suppressed by his existance. 
So my failure to keep up in the prerequiste courses of my former inspiration, along with a dad-turned-madman and my mental conflicts, I cannot move on with my life. I can't even confront my parents about how I feel.
My dad will just go Mao-mode, and my mom will probably fall into depression. And I realized how horrible I've treated my mom in the past, so I do not want to make her life worse now by telling her I no longer want to persue my former dream. I know they want the best for me, to find a job and live, but I know I will never be happy with that path. 
Yet at the end of the day? It comes back to the beginning: I can't act upon it. Well, I am capable of doing it, but I am incapable of pushing myself to do it. My mindset has been so deformed that I am no longer able to be independent. 
At the eve of every day, I tell myself to take the easy way out. I know the default argument is: ""What about all of those people who care about you?"" and I completely understand it. I know it is selfish of me to even consider it, but I feel like everyone has their boundaires. I feel justified to say I just cannot handle all of this anymore. 

But at the end of the day, I find myself still living and continue to make my life a living hell.

I mean a real skinny bitch, the type you losers jack off to, she didnt weigh more than 5 pounds.

496760523694278_614204048616591,"I know that people who lift are kind of a running joke on the interwebz and even on this page.  I'm a pretty strong kid, so I get ""do you even lift brah?"" on a daily basis.  For many people, its a way of bettering themselves.  For some, its about making yourself look good.  For me however, its my way of escaping.

Keep in mind that for me, lifting and talking are about the only two things that I'm good at.  Can't say that I'm all that attractive, I'm smart but not a stellar student, and I've never had a million friends.  When things ever got tough, i started eating.  Eventually, I'd gained a fair bit of weight.  I wasn't ""fat"" (this was mostly due to broad shoulders and a decent amount of muscle), but I considered myself about 25lbs overweight.  Once I got to be serious about my sport however, I found lifting.  Eventually, I lost that fat, picked up muscle, and I found a new, healthier way of escaping life's issues.  Half of why I came to Berkeley however, was so that I could escape some of the friend issues that I dealt with in high school.

Which brings me to my roommates.  I absolutely love them to death, but they seriously don't know where the line is when it comes to jokes.  Often times it turns into a 2-on-1 kind of thing, and when my ex is in the room, a 3-on-1 deal.  I've told them each that its getting to be a bit much.  I wouldn't have an issue if it was more of a level playing field, but now, seeing as I'm not close to the kids on my floor, I don't have anyone in my life on a daily basis that doesn't give me non-stop shit.  Between them and school, lifting is really the only part of my week (of my day if i'm very, very lucky) that I actually feel good about myself.  I came to Cal so that it wouldn't have to be as much as an ""escape"" for me anymore.  Only now, its even more of one.

tl;dr, understand that sometimes, we don't lift to be ""bros,"" we aren't all ""curlbrah's,"" and we don't do it to feel like we are superior to those who ""don't even lift.""  Sometimes, its the only thing that keeps us from going insane.",,status,,2013-11-20 16:18:58,16,5,0

The white girls were laughing minding their own business and the African-American girl with running shoes tied to her backpack was finishing her brunch. 

She got up and left all her shit on the table like she was at a damn ihop dining place or some shit. 

So she's getting up and one of the white girls goes like ""hey you, pick up after yourself no one's here to do that for you anymore."" 

LOL all I have to say right now because that girl looked all stupid asking where the place for the dishes was; she claimed she didn't even know about it. She dropped plates and forks trying to take her plates. 

I want to thank those white girls because it's the workers who have to pick up that shit. You're in fucking college clean up after your fucking self.

So please, before you open your mouth, just think about why you need to say what you do. Stop starting shitstorms over nothing.

It's ridiculous to me to see that some people are giving up their pets because their new roommate is allergic, etc (because, well, they had the animal before they got the roommate!)

What enrages me even more is when people try to SELL their animals. How could they live with themselves trying to profit off of a life? It is also irresponsible and wrong for them to breed their animals, since there are so many animals that are euthanized in shelters each year due to lack of space and lack of people willing to take them in. 

Yes, I understand that people are trying to re-home the animals themselves before bringing them to a shelter, but I think they should have considered the entire life of the animal before bringing them into their home. Also, there are some shelters that do not euthanize their animals.

The blood rushes to my cock and boom I fuck... but unfortunately, after about a few minutes I want to have sex again. It is only after I have ejaculated approximately 4 times (with a standard deviation of 1) that I lose my urge to have sex. But no matter what, that next day I wake up with a rock hard boner--ready to pursue my fornicating passions. 

I can't focus on school. My GPA has gone from a 3.8 to a 2.8 this semester. Currently, I'm rubbing my hard penis with my forearm as I type. It's THAT bad- - It won't stop.

No, I do not watch porn (I gave that up a while ago).... I masturbate relatively frequently without porn (definitely once a day). 

So I ask... males and females of bold Berk: do you have these issues? Do you know how to alleviate this tension formulating in my testicles? I need help.

496760523694278_613531748683821,"1. My dorm room is situated near the bathroom in my mini-suite. Yesterday morning, I heard someone turn on the shower. Then, I heard some moaning and groaning sounds which sounded oddly tinny. Knowing my suite mates and their inability to even talk to a girl without acting like a six year old, I concluded that one of my suite mates was watching porn before hopping in the shower, hoping no one would hear the sounds over the shower. After 2 minutes of this excruciating ordeal, I stormed into the bathroom and yelled that if he wanted to watch porn, he should have the decency to put on headphones and leave the rest of us to study for midterms. Now the suite mate is pissed at me, and somewhat embarrassed, as he has purposefully tried to avoid eye contact with me for the past few days. I really hope my housing transfer goes through; I can't go through this anymore.
2. The same suite mate has a crush; he tries so hard to make it known. He acts like a sixth grader when it comes to crushes; he showed me that 'because everyone always looks at my phone,' he changed the name of his crush to '------' so no one would know the name of his crush. 
3. My other suite mate is a legit fag. He and his boyfriend have started showering together. I know I shouldn't be freaked out, but I am. I'm horrified by what potentially goes on in there, and don't want to be showering in an area where a cockfest took place. I really need to move soon.
4. My OTHER suite-mate is a genetic mess. He's color-blind, has a heart condition, is asexual, is allergic to alcohol, and to top it all off, he's 5'4"" and 88 pounds. He also doesn't give two shits about his appearance, which makes me mad. I think every man should take a minimal amount of pride in keeping their appearance presentable. This suite mate tried to cut his hair the other day, and managed to drop the razor down the side of his head, leaving a bald spot on the side of his head. I urged him to go to a hair salon and get it fixed, but he said ""it wasn't a big deal"" and now walks around looking like a maniac with half of his head with a buzz cut and the other half a virtual mullet.
5. I am depressed by the lack of attractive girls here. I mean, my friend and I did a rating of the girls that entered the dining common in a period of 30 minutes, and out of 40 girls, two were worthy of a double take, translating to a 5-6 on a scale of 10. We're not even talking about HOT girls, just Attractive enough to warrant some attention.

496760523694278_613361618700834,"Had sex in class with a feminist today.

Was in VLSB lecture hall and it was early in the morning. I had a lil morning wood and I didn't feel like listening to the professor.

So I was sitting near the back row with no one to my sides except this one pale looking nerdy Asian chick. I'm talking thick frames, tangled hair, pale skin, and hugely conservative clothing. She wasn't very attractive but she seemed like an excellent target. 

So I scooted on over to her and asked if she had the notes from last lecture. The cunt had the bollocks to say no when it was obvious she writes down every little thing the professor says. No matter, vengeance shall be mine in a few moments. 

So I lean a little closer to her but she doesn't notice yet. I continue to inch my way towards her until inches become cm's and, when I'm nearly touching her with my leg I poke her thigh with my finger. She moves her leg. I do it again a minute later. And then again. Eventually she glares at me. 

I then just put my hand on her thigh, she looks at me, I pretend to be listening to the professor and writing notes with mi otro mano. I start to stroke her thigh and she tries to push my hand off, but her Asian grip was of no use. She started to make noises, and students looked, but my quick reflexes allowed me to look like I was in intense note-taking mode.

When they turned, I rested my arm on her thigh and again she attempted to push me off. It was at this point that I realized she had some feminist sticker type thing on her backpack. Oh boy, what had I gotten myself into? I am sure to end up in prison now, so I said, ""fuck it,"" under my breath and rested my hand on her vagina. 

Interestingly, while she did try to push it away, you could tell it was a half-assed effort, it seemed like she actually did want my hand to be there, in some back part of her mind. Maybe I'm just invoking the urge that all women want, to secretly be raped. I finger my way into her jeans and start rubbing her crotch. She lets out a little moan.

Just as I thought. I quickly pulled my hand out of her pants and looked at her face, she looked at me, and those eyes craved for more. She moaned like a Japanese school girl getting molested on a bus. 

I grabbed her hand and rested it on my now 4.25"" rock hard bulge. She stroked it through my jeans and eventually put her hands down my pants, playing with my pubes and rubbing the tip of my trombone. 

At the same time, I was fingering her, and 20 minutes of this continued until I ejaculated through my jeans. I simply waited as the stain darkened among the denim until class was over. I grabbed her by the hand and pulled her into the boy's bathroom in VLSB.

I banged her brains out and finished in her.

It's important for a subset of individuals educated in social science work on the evaluation of society and social issues in order for us, as a collective society, to be informed when it's time to make decisions about things like policy, and realize that (believe it or not) unemployment and inflation in the aggregate economy aren't the only things that matter.

Long line today.” But after a moment I noticed they were holding signs such as “It’s not food, it’s violence,” and “Animals are people too.” The crowd was protesting Chipotle and being filmed by some local news network. I walked over and asked them what they were protesting and was met with a rehearsed spew of clichés about how I need to know where my food comes from, how corporations are evil, and intentionally practice animal cruelty. Completely unfounded crap of the sort. I asked them what they advise people to do. The response was “Stop eating animals. Everyone should be a vegetarian. Animals are not ours to eat. Trust me, you’ll feel so much better as soon as you do.”

This protest was one of the most frustrating things I’ve seen in my two years at Berkeley so far for many reasons. 

First, it is ecologically impossible for everyone to be a vegetarian. We don’t have enough agricultural land in the United States for everyone to adopt a purely vegetarian diet. If we were to expand and import, this would be far more destructive than killing animals. Agriculture is among the most destructive human practices in history. It is essentially biotic cleansing. It requires taking entire living communities and clearing them away for planting space for humans. Encouraging this mass adoption of vegetarian and veganism would do significantly more harm to the world than continuing current animal practices. 

Second, these protestors claimed that removing meat from my diet would instantly make me feel better. This is not only nutritionally false, but it is also such a wrong approach towards “saving animals.” I’ve personally known many people who are vegan here at Berkeley. I know there is a right way to be vegan, but doing it the wrong way can result in bodily harm, which I’ve also seen among my vegan friends. And removing meat from my diet so I can feel better about myself? Clearly, animal cruelty isn’t the concern here. It’s just some self-righteous circle jerk where all these people can feel good about how they’re “saving the world” by not eating animals. 

I understand that the current practices of animal slaughtering and immoral, but death is death. There is no outstandingly humane way to kill an animal. The planet would be turned into a desert in a matter of years if we had to have enough agriculture for everyone to be a vegetarian or vegan. While we can advise better practices for slaughtering animals, all these people who claim that everyone should be vegetarian/vegan really need to get off their high horses and realize that’s not at all viable.

Tl;dr: Being vegan/vegetarian doesn’t make you a superhero. Understand the implications that come with telling everyone to do the same. Protestors need to get their shit together and focus on the message of animal cruelty and how it can be avoided.",,status,,2013-11-17 20:00:02,138,15,3

so many girls i've spoken to say that they don't lift weights because they don't want to look like a guy........ you will only look like a guy if u actually produce an adequate level of testosterone.. which no girl naturally does. essentially, when a women lifts weight they get toned as fuckk... an appearance i'd say 90% of guys appreciate 

so to the women who lift i say thank you. i thank the girl i met this weekend whose ass felt firmly suitable in the palm of my hand. am i being a fucking sexist? am i being a fucking anti feminist? FUCK NO.. im just appreciating an aesthetically pleasing female body. 

so women... stop the fucking shit in the rsf that focuses solely on the elliptical or other monotonous excercise. the human body naturally adapts to the same movements (it basically finds a more efficient way of doing the same exercise)... to apply an appropriate Berkeley metaphor: you don't study the third grade your entire life... you move on to the next grade and then the next, etc. etc. because you're mind gets better... well so does you're body 

oh you have test? you have boy problems? you have insecurity issues ? get that ass in the gym and lift. guys won't judge you. they will respect the fact that you are trying to improve the  body you currently have.

You know when people joke around saying ""smoke weed all day, er'day?"" Where I'm from and the culture I'm accustomed to, that's not even a joke. For this entire semester I was high in class. I could count the days I wasn't high on my fingers. I started my morning with a milky bowl of tobacco and herb (called a moch, fiddy, bloop, popper, mole, toaster, whatever you like to call it. If you have no tolerance to weed or tobacco, one of these would absolutely fuck you up. We used to call them comatoasters because your first one will flood your brain with pleasureable chemicals and you literally lose conciousness for a minute from the overload of pleasure, like being bathed in warm, profound vibrations. But I don't stop there, because due to the law of diminishing returns I never feel satisfied anymore. It's not like ""OMG i can't go a day without taking a bong rip"" it's more like ""hmmm yes a few more and then I'll do _____."" I would have two or three or more rips before I go to my 11 am, which has  and then spend the whole day feeling anxious and afraid of speaking to others because of my cracking voice and lack of social motivation. I never counted rips. Couldn't. I would lose track. I'm saying I would average around 20 a day, and that's a weekday.

 I'm not trying to brag, I'm being honest about how shitty my situation is. I'm saying this because, I'm the kind of person that took it too far, and I am suffering socially because of it. Like I could care less what you do with your life, but you've go to understand, there ARE people like this, and we walk among you.

 I'm not trying to brag, I'm being honest about how shitty my situation is. That's why I got rid of all my stuff. But you all should understand that for this semester, I felt like I was in a different universe than the rest of the Berkeley community because I am literally a recluse. I'm sick of feeling alienated and abject. To me, this means garnering the strength to stop. I'm fucking done smoking weed. I'm fucking done smoking weed. I can affirm that I know more about being high than any one of the braindeads that are laughing at me right now for quitting a ""harmless drug,"" so I'm gonna let you do what you do, but for me, I'm retiring.

496760523694278_612142792156050,"I think feminism is bringing about the downfall of society. All women have a self-entitlement complex upon birth. Eggs are biologically more valuable than sperm, and the brains of males and females have evolved to reflect this. In women, their minds are primed from birth to regard themselves as the more valuable sex, and this is true, at least in the reproductive arena. Men, however, are primed to regard themselves as less individually valuable than women, and this manifests as a willingness to take more mortal risks. Women didn't go to war for thousands of years. Women tend to shy away from high-risk jobs. 95% of workplace deaths are men. Women have the power when it comes to sex. And now that feminism is ""empowering women"", the one thing that most men traditionally had to make sure their genetic lineage went on, their ability to provide, has gone down the drain. In the old days, if a woman cheated and was found out, she could be left with nothing. Now, in the era of ""let's-give-everything-to-women-who-divorce"" laws and Obamacare, women can go out ride the cock carousel and cuckold their husbands without repercussion. Marriage used to be a retirement plan for women - as long as they stayed loyal. Now, women can be as slutty as they want, because the state doesn't care. Alimony and child support payments will keep her nicely afloat at the cost of her poor sucker ex-husband. And that child might not even be his. Feminism: giving women the upper hand because all the Aces and Kings they hold in the sexual selection market aren't enough.

I fucked a feminist on her roommate's bed today. I enjoyed making her wince in pain with every thrust during anal. Then I wiped a little bit of the shit underneath her desk when she left the room. I told her all of this when she came back. To be fair, I did feel a little bad, but only because she was cute. I guess not all feminists are ugly.",,status,,2013-11-15 18:08:42,16,18,1

And so you spend your time in vague regret or vaguer hope that something good will come along. Something to make you feel connected, something to make you feel whole, something to make you feel loved.

I am passionate about science and love learning anything that pertains to science, which is why I chose this major. I thought that college was supposed to be a place where we explore our passions and get to delve into a particular subject that fascinates us.

I think it's a shame, though, that a lot of the people in my major care VERY little for the actual subject matter of the courses required for it. They care only about a letter grade on paper and will simply memorize tons of information and regurgitate it on tests, then completely forget it.

I understand that they need to care a lot about their grades for medical school admissions, but from my experience I can sufficiently say that if you are passionate enough about the actual material of a certain course and apply yourself to it simply out of this passion, then a good grade will probably come naturally. I think this is true for all areas of study and all majors. That's how learning should be. That memorization and regurgitation cycle just makes me a little sad...

It's even more sad that MCB has become this distinctly ""pre-med"" major that everyone flocks to as a good way to prepare for medical school and that most of these people don't give two shits about molecular and cell biology.",,status,,2013-11-14 18:24:41,38,5,0

Here are all of us: thousands of us. We come from lots of places with lots of experiences and lots of interests; diversity defines us so much that it's used to advertise the school we attend. 

And yet, even though our school prides itself on our diversity, it seems like that's just what society wants to destroy. As aforementioned, there are many academic interests at Berkeley: One person wants to study English, another Mathematics, another Molecular and Cell Biology, some EECS, Gender and Women's Studies, Physics, Rhetoric, Political Science, Anthropology... You name it, someone is studying in it here. However, to many of these, society simply says ""no.""

And it says ""no"" because the world is ruled by flimsy paper bills and tiny metal coins.

You want to study English? ""No. There's no job, you'll have to be a, oh dear... a TEACHER!"" You want to study Ethnic Studies? ""No. What could you possibly do with that?"" Rhetoric, Psychology, Music, Art History? ""No, where's the money??""

Society says ""yes"" to the studies that lead to the jobs that create the green. Pre-Med? ""Yes!"" Pre-Law? ""Yes!!"" Engineering? ""Oh, yes, please!""

We pride ourselves and our school on diversity, and yet that's exactly what our society is trying to ruin. Society has conditioned us to think not in terms of passion, or interest, but to think in terms of money and to call it ""thinking logically about our futures.""

I want to know when ""thinking logically"" stopped meaning picking what you're going to study based on what you're going to ENJOY studying. There's nothing wrong with people studying these ""green-making majors"" if you enjoy them, but it's upsetting that so, so many people are studying what they are just to have a ""good job.""

Not to mention–the terror of knowing that many of our society's future engineers, doctors, and lawyers will not be motivated by the prospects of solving problems, saving lives, and fighting for justice, but instead by paychecks with a greater distance between the dollar sign and the decimal point.",,status,,2013-11-14 03:37:34,80,12,1

I grew up in a conservative neighborhood, but went to a highly liberal, mixed high school about an hour away and you know what I've noticed in the time I spent there?? Nobody gives a legitimate fuck about that shit anymore! The only people stressing the importance of racism/sexism or getting worked up over it are insecure people and pretentious ""socialites."" And while there are many cures to insecurity and cocky peppiness, I don't believe that the race/sexism discussions will solve anything. 
Now don't get me wrong. I believe in and cherish equal rights as much as the next American, but this is utter bullshit. Do you want to know how to cure ""racism""? Stop talking to about it. ""But white people have.."" ""But black people.. "" No. No, just stop. By pointing out demographic ""flaws"" you're only making it a lot worse. You're discriminating against yourself as a human by panicking that you're being discriminated upon by race. I've shared this view before with my peers and many have called me ""ignorant"" and ""selfish"" for overlooking cultural positions. But - what cultural positions? I understand you feel obliged to have an identity tied to your roots - (ex. young, underrepresented woman from Nigeria) - but guess what? You live in America now. And for heaven's sakes, you go to Berkeley. And I'm not saying that being attached to an identity is bad - rather, it's something you should be immensely proud of! I'm just saying that it's not something to create campuswide issues about. I mean, Berkeley spends thousands of dollars every year on our African American/Native American/etc theme programs since so many underrepresented students don't feel comfortable here, among a sea of people that don't look anything like them. 
This is cultural attitude problem, if anything. C'mon. It's the 21st century. Why do looks even matter any more? Why does it matter if ""only"" 38 people in the UCLA freshman class this year are black? Why does it matter if I'm brown, black, white, red, blue, or purple? I'm a human being, just like you, with real veins and blood and plasma and cells. Why do we still actively discriminate while talking about social equity? Just stop talking about it. Look past the skin color and ethnicity; accept people for who they are - People. Not a black person. Not a native american person. Not an asian person. Simply, a person. 

(I know most of you are going to shit all over this, talking about how ironic and hypocritical it is that I'm talking about this when I clearly argue to do otherwise; it's just that I'm sick of this shit and didn't know  a better place to confess something that's been on my mind lately.)",,status,,2013-11-13 03:10:17,18,6,0

The problem is, you have a boyfriend.  And I wish that it was me and not him.  I love being such good friends with you, but I have an enormous crush on you and sometimes I feel as if you feel the same way about me.  I can talk to you about anything and you know that you can do the same with me.  But this is one thing that I have been reserved about.  There have been plenty of times that I've wanted to kiss you and show you how much I really care for you, but I've refrained because I respect you too much and the fact that you're in a relationship.  I also don't want to damage our friendship if this was the wrong move.

You had mentioned something about taking chances and to put myself out there.  I was about to completely spill everything to you because I was sure that you knew that it was you I was thinking about, but then you mentioned something that made me think you really had no clue.  And so I refrained again in fear that you would take my confession the wrong way.  

You just brighten my world. When you smile and laugh I can't help but do the same because that's when you're most beautiful.  Your eyes sparkle and your smile lights up the room.  It gets me every time, time and time again. 

I'm getting to the point to where I feel like I'm just going to tell you everything. In person. About how you make my heart melt when you wish me luck with everything I have to do, and how we laugh about the same stupid things that everyone else probably thinks we're idiots for laughing at.

For some reason, this gave me a raging boner. I immediately ran to her and told her to pull down her shorts. There are children in the vicinity taking a look at the campus. She didn't speak a lick of English, so I grabbed her and pulled her into the bushes and told her to pull down her shorts and motioned her to do it by pretending to pull down my pants.

That signing in guests is all fine and dandy throughout the year, but when it's still required during move out everyone shits a brick (including the parents that think security for their kid is SUPER important). And I get upset when someone vandalizes flyers because even though it's something that is just printed on paper and could be reproduced, it took me an hour and a half to make the template because I do have standards on quality, and it took me another half hour to put up all the flyers throughout the building. I hate most of all when I hear someone talking down on one of my co-workers. You can have an opinion on your RA, PA, TPA, etc. But keep in mind that we are human beings too. So just pause for a moment before you start talking about how so-and-so is a bitch for writing you up for drinking because you probably didn't know that to NOT write you up could mean losing their job (a job that allows some of us to even be able to afford to go to Cal). #RantOver

This is my second confession as a hall staff member: in the end, I am truly thankful to work with residents and hall staff across the system. I have made so many friends and unique experiences that I know I wouldn't have been able to get in any other job. As many WTF type stories I have about residents, I also have stories about how residents have impacted me. That note you left on my door? I put it up near my desk so I can remember that some of my actions do matter. That surprise birthday party for someone on the floor that you invited me to? I was grateful to be included. Every time you tell me thank you, I glow inside because it means you care too.  I have grown as a person, met my best friends, and bonded with others despite diversity/challenges because I am a staff member and because you as a resident have allowed me to be a part of your Cal experience. I may bitch and moan, but I wouldn't continue with this job if I didn't think it was all worth it in the end.",,status,,2013-11-12 16:28:24,55,1,1

496760523694278_610353155668347,"I am an International student from a developing country in Asia, and the previous posts about majors have made me decided to type this post.  Coming from a country where poor people are really poor and rich people are very rich, I am aware of how privileged I am.  Both my parents are very racist people, and so living at home, seeing how cruel they treated the maids, while being so nice to me was really a torture.  Three years ago, when I got into Cal’s College of Engineering, they were extremely happy, and had already plan out my entire future after graduating from Cal for me.  I have always been a pretty good student at STEM, but in my high school, almost every student is very good at math and science, I know I am just lucky plus my parents are one of the few that can support their children to study abroad.  

Sorry, let me go straight to my point.  Freshman year in Cal was really relaxing, the classes for my major weren’t really that challenging but fun.  I was so sure that I would probably just double in EECS/MSE, as my parents wanted me to, until I took a non-major lower div class in my sophomore year – Development Studies 10 with Professor Michael Watts.  Professor Watts’ lectures were so inspiring, that even though I got my first B at Cal from that class (as you can probably tell, my English is terrible, can’t really speak in discussion, plus I have really bad essay writing skill), I started to have this “terrible” idea of switching major.  To all the native speakers in that class, it must be an easy A, not because the materials were easy, but Professor was kind enough to make most of the readings optional, so if you were taking the class just for requirements, you could have good grade without studying too hard, but if you are serious into help making the world become a better place, optional readings help you to understand a lot of deeper about how inequalities in different part of the world were build up and grow.  

After a year of internal struggling, I am now double majoring in Development Studies & Political Science, with terrible GPA, cause I still speak little to none during discussion sections and write terrible essays.  The worst thing is, I still don’t have the courage to tell my parents that I actually switched college and majors to the “useless ones”, and I’m not planning to tell them until I graduate, once thing is done, it’s done.  All my friends think that’s a terrible decision that I made, and yes, I kind of agree.  I don’t know why I am choosing the majors that most people would consider easier than my previous majors, and even worse when I am actually super bad at doing readings, writing and speaking in English (we should just study what we are best at, isn’t it?).  The thing is, there are so many talented and smart people in the STEM fields already (at least in my country, since in many developing countries, that is one of the few ways to become wealthy - doctor/lawyer/engineer, choose one), when there are so little educated people who care enough to solve the government corruption problems and fight and speak for the bottom billion. 

 I don’t know how to conclude my thought, so let me just type my last few sentences…  I found it sad and funny the same time that people are arguing about which majors are more superior to the others.  Your parents did not give you that smart brain to just show off on facebook and look down at others.  If you are that smart, good for you for having the opportunity to find out how talented you are instead of fighting starvation throughout your childhood.  If you are that such, don’t you think it would be such a waste if you don’t try to make a good and huge impact on this planet instead of just use your super intelligent brain as a show off object?  Can we just all think less about individual success and more about human beings/ mother nature’s future as a whole?

I am not really a fan of that because I just can't imagine sticking my dick in there, even with how much I love her.

at school today, in front of sproul. A group of feminists were protesting about equality and crap like that.

They said, to repay for years of inequality, 20% of all male's earnings should go towards women. Dead serious.

They also said that women should have to pay less for food and men should have to pay more to make up for the 100's of years of inequality and that this should go on for 100's of years.

I asked the leader if she even knew what equality was and she said it's when everyone is treated equally and fairly. And I asked how the f*** is this fair? I wasn't alive 100's years of ago. I never did anything to you, why the f*** should I pay more? And she said that even though you weren't alive, you still benefit from the social prestige of being a male.

At this point I was furious, and I told her you know what else needs to be socially acceptable as equality? A man and a woman getting into a street fight. She was flabbergasted and became very irate and scolded me for even thinking of hitting a woman and how it's very disrespectful. I told her to shut her fat face up and she slapped me.

I immediately countered with a right upper cut into her gut and tore a piece of her blouse. She immediately bent over, grasping her gut in pain like Vegeta when Goku punched him in the stomach. She tried to fight back but I delivered an axe kick to the back of her head and she went down unconscious.

But I don't think you know my reasons for wanting to be near you. Once, I was with you and I wished you would just kiss me. You paused and asked me what I was thinking about.

I guess she thought she was feeling things because as she turned around I put myself in an idle position that seemed like I had done nothing and didn't want to attract her attention.

So this time, I finally just grabbed her shoulder and tugged her my way and said, ""Hey what's up, gawjus, you gonna grab the samurai surf and turf? I've been waiting ages for that.""

Ignoring my question, she replied, ""What do you want?""

I said, ""Yeah, I agree, but they could have put more sauce."" She said, ""Yeah.""

496760523694278_609900782380251,So about 3 or so weeks ago I broke up with my boyfriend. We were dating for about a year. The whole long distance relationship in college (he goes to college in florida) was so hard for both of use. The hardest part is that neither of use cheated on one another or did anything to make this relationship bad. I know this might sound crazy but I actually really miss him. I know that I broke up with him but I still really love him and miss him. He was the perfect guy that any girl could ask for. He always treated me with so much respect. He would never do anything to hurt me. The thought of him getting and sleeping with other girls just breaks my heart. Even though we go to different schools and he probably won't be reading this I still want him to know that I love hime and truly miss him.,,status,,2013-11-11 01:48:25,17,1,0

In discussion today we had a group project where he had to each write a paragraph about A Good Man Is Hard To Find. I was grouped up with a muslim chick (yes she had the doorag on her head and all), and 2 other guys. She was kind of cute, but I couldn't fully see her face.

Regardless, I still took the chance. Practice is practice.

When we grouped up, I assumed leadership and assigned which motifs that each person should analyze in a single paragraph. I told the muslim girl to specifically analyze every man and specifically discuss the inherent flaws.

After we completed the tasks and finished early, I asked her, ""What do you like to do for fun? Do you party?""

She quickly looked up at me with a bewildered stare and her head motioned as if she were saying, ""Umm... hello... can you see what I'm wearing? Obviously I don't party.""

She soon replied and said in a sad mumble, ""No...""

I could tell she felt trapped and actually did want to party. But I also don't party, so I replied with, ""Same here. It isn't very fun. We should get together some time. Grab a drink, perhaps?""

Again with a sigh of disappointment she replied, ""I don't think so.""

Two cops suddenly emerged upon the streets, bruised up and hungry for blood. As I ran to look out my window I saw crowds of people rushing out into the streets to see what was going on. What they saw were two cops ready to kill each over what appears to be a brief case. The white cop had the other black cop held up, and said he's going to collect the brief case for evidence while the black cop said he's gonna get the gun lying on the floor and then he's gonna get the money. I suspect the briefcase contains money.

The black cop truly believes the white cop won't shoot him and he'll be able to pick up the gun, get the money, and get outta there. So as the black cop advances for the gun, the white cop shoots him in his ass. The white cop means business and makes it clear that the next shot will kill the other cop. The white cop then asks the other cop if he wants to go home, the other cop says yeah, he wants his money so he could go home. The white cop takes off the black cop's badge and said he doesn't deserve to wear it.

Alarmingly, one of the crowd member's picks up the gun and points it at the black cop and says the white cop can go on and bounce. The white cop picks up the briefcase and departs from our suburban ghetto. The black cop was furious, he said he's going to put cases on everyone in the crowd, sending them to Pelican Bay under 24 hour lockdown, forcing the SHU program on them. Feeling legitimately threatened, the crowd dispersed and what was left was an injured black cop who also fled the scene.",,status,,2013-11-10 22:08:27,4,2,0

First of all, I just want to make it clear that I am not completely against the Stanford-Berkeley rivalry; I think a friendly rivalry can be great. However, some people just take it too far! For example, I believe it to be completely disrespectful that during the national anthem at football games some people yell ""blue"" over the lyrics' ""red."" Yes, red is the color of our rival school but that doesn't mean that absolutely every instance of the color in life must be associated with them. I personally find this insulting and disrespectful to the national anthem and everything it stands for.

496760523694278_609222339114762,"So here is the skinny,

I am a senior year, the time when I should have everything figured out. However, that’s not the case. I know not what I will do with my life. I am pissed and confused. Pissed at myself for not being like my peers who have full-time offers, internships, etc. lined up. And its my fault to be honest, I am too damn afraid. I am afraid of what is happening to me. I am afraid of reality coming in one day and curbstomping me for not having a plan. 

I am afraid all the time. Each morning I am afraid if I will survive the next day. Afraid of being alone. Afraid that despite the friends I have helped over my time here I am alone. I see people walking up and down Sproul with their friends happily chatting away their time here. Yet I am here stuck thinking: What the fuck. But I keep moving on, isolated from the world with my earbuds I keep walking through crowded roads of Berkeley completely alone. 

I keep a good face, 9 out of 10 days I shrug it off and move on. I smile at work because that’s a part of my work description. But the moment I clock out all the lonesomeness and pain comes back. Those feelings are like vultures, they never leave me, they seek my weakest moments and they are merciless when they strike. 
I don’t want to be a burden to my friends, I don’t want them to say, “Here they go again, asking for help etc. etc.” I don’t know how many times I have run away from people closest to me. So I run away, away from my friends, afraid that they will do the same to me if I dare to come closer. 

So I am angry, at myself, at reality, at the fact that I am wasting the precious little time I have here at Cal. The clock is a ticking and yet here I am. Feeling worse than junk, knowing that the front I put up most of the time is but a charade put on for the audience of none. 
So I search for salvation in distraction, work in the library till the little house during the week, and while others drink to celebrate, well, you know the rest. 

And I know that once I wake up, again I will be dragging myself out of the gutter, somedays I succeed, somedays I fall all the way back.",,status,,2013-11-09 16:22:20,13,3,1

496760523694278_608888659148130,"My love for this school is unconditional. I grew up in a Latino/Hispanic community, and being introduced to such diversity has really opened my mind. I've learned to interact with so many people of different backgrounds and I can honestly say it's one of the most interesting experiences I have ever came across in my life.Point is, I'm loving this school and the people in it. This University was my first choice since 9th grade, and I can assure that I will give it my 110% to make my school and family proud, as a MCB/Pre-med major, but most importantly, as a BEAR! We Latinos/Hispanics are one of the most humble and generous races. We work really hard to gain respect from everyone. Trust me, I've been to work with my dad(he does flooring), and I don't know how he can handle it.Waking up at 4 a.m. every day, being on your knees the whole time and lifting heavy roles of carpet and heavy boxes of tiles is truly a b@#$%. But what sucks even more is the salary he's receiving that isn't worth doing the labor work for. But he still does it. To provide for his family. And this goes to many other races as well that face different struggles, but don't gain the respect they deserve. That includes asians, caucasians, african/african americans, native americans, etc. Well have a great evening everyone. Do your best in all your classes. I know it can be really tough at some points, but just keep in thought that its freaking hard but not impossible. Much love to all my fellow BEARS.

Sincerely, 
The mysterious Mexican American guy. lol.

I wrote the original piece on my outrage/generalization against Chicanos who choose ""useless"" majors. After reading some of the more thoughtful responses, I want to tell you that I learned a lot, and after reflecting, I wanted to thank you for changing my perspective:

It is incredibly hard to be inspired at a young age toward education, regardless of socioeconomic standing. Add in the dangerous environment, poverty, social pressure, problems at home, supporting one's family, helping raising younger siblings, etc. and the chances become evermore bleak. Add in the lack of educational resources, guidance from parents who have learned educational best practices and basic infrastructure set up for student success and the chances become everMORE bleak.

I commend you all who made it this far: gaining access to the top public university in the world.

Here's the thing that I guess I realized: I probably had so much anger because I just hate to see my fellow brothers and sisters fall through the cracks; I hate to see parents who work so damn hard only for their kids to fuck up and take it for granted and instead do drugs, hit the streets, or drop out. The small % who actually made it into college, and the even SMALLER % who made it into Berkeley, are truly special - and I think that my outrage was because I am just so worried about folks who take up majors that the job market doesn't necessarily demand.. I'm just worried! There's such a history of intergenerational struggle and sacrifice behind you getting here, and we all know that education is a means to upward social mobility, but not all educational majors are valued equally in the job market! I'm just worried man, and I really hate that I expressed my genuine concern in a way that was instead aggressive, ignorant and hateful.

I'm so sorry. I hope you all can understand. I truly did learn a lot though from all your comments.. thank you. I will carry this perspective going into the professional and social world forever, and will look at minority folks who make it through the system in a very high regard.

also, fuck Chicano / Chicano people who somehow got into Cal. i'm tired of paying full tuition here so you can major in Chicano Studies. Go to SF State for that shit; it won't make a fucking difference anyways.",,status,,2013-11-08 03:26:51,5,23,0

My little sister and I started a t-shirt line that is very near and dear to our hearts because it is named after our mom who passed away a year and a half ago from ovarian cancer. We created this t-shirt line so that we can keep her legacy alive, but also to help us contribUte to my mom's non-profit organization AISCS (aiscs.org) . Which works to empower women, bring water and education to children in rural Tanzania.

Our clothing line is called ""akelo."" and you can check us out on facebook at: www.facebook.com/akelolifestyleco to learn more about us.

The reason I am posting is because we have t-shirts, but we want people like you to model them for us. We want to have a photo session in Berkeley on Saturday Nov. 9th, so if any of you are interested in volunteering your time, that would be amazing! Of course we can only have people 18 and over unless they have their parents with them and we will ask everyone to sign a photo waiver. We can't really afford to pay anyone, but we will be happy to email you a copy of the picture we take of you and if you want to buy a t-shirt, that would be AMAZING! We are not professional photographers at all, so no pressure.

Please message us on our facebook page if you're interested. :)

Thanks!

496760523694278_608000912570238,"Before coming to Berkeley I knew it was going to be a challenge, but I was determined that I would figure it all out once I got here.Coming to Berkeley has been one of the hardest things I've ever done. I am literally working the hardest I have ever worked and time after time I am disappointed that even with all the work I put in, that I am barely passing and in some cases failing. I came in with an idea of what I wanted to pursue, and now I unsure of what to do. It is a routine of stressing myself out and pushing myself, and all for what seems like nothing. 

I used to be very social, now I am spending most of my time in class, in the library, or in my room studying, reading, or writing a paper. I still make a conscious effort to stop, take a break, eat, shower, and sleep, but I'm always thinking of when is all this going to just explode and I lose it. 

It's hard seeing everyone else manage all of this, while I am here on the edge of what feels like the lowest point I've ever been in my life. Some days I think of transferring out to a community college, but I have too much pride to throw away everything. Sometimes I dream I had the courage to just call it quits, sell everything in my possession, gather all my money from bank accounts, pick up my passport and just fall off the grid. I'd much rather spend this one life I had exploring all the beauty of the world. Go base jumping, go cliff diving on some remote island, climb a mountain, experience all there is in life...

It's weird. I thought college was going to be the best time of my life...I mean everyone said it would...and I was excited! But turns out, it's been a disappointment so far. I've tried. I've really tried to enjoy my time here, but I can't. I guess it's due to the lack of friends I have here. I mean don't get me wrong, I do have ""friends"", or are they really? They hit me up when they're bored or have no one else to call. They text me when all their other friends are busy. If I were to just disappear would they care? No. I sincerely and honestly do not think so.
I'm not sure if it's me or not. I mean, I think I'm a fairly average person. So why am I incapable of making true and real friends? It sucks...I mean it really sucks. I don't think anyone deserves to be lonely in this world, but here I am...lonely as ever. I know it may seen like I'm complaining, but I'm a 2nd year student right now and honestly, I'm getting tired of this. Tired of being sad a night. Tired of being close to tears daily. Tired of looking through my phone and noticing that there isn't anyone I can call if I were in trouble or needed someone to talk to. The only people that I feel a close connection to are my friends from high school, but they're far far away at their college. They've made great friends, and though I a happy that they're having a blast, I'm jealous. And bitter at times.
What I want is just to be happy. I do not know what I'm doing wrong. I've joined clubs, but I feel like I don't fit in anywhere. Some of you may say ""You're not trying hard enough!""...But I am. It's not like I'm an antisocial person who doesn't talk to anyone...though I feel like this loneliness is slowly eating me up. Maybe this in turn has made me slightly anti-social? I don't know. When I hit people up, we hang out...and that's it. I invite and invite and invite....yet I get none back. Does this mean they don't like me? I feel like they'll jump at the opportunity to call me when they need something...like homework help.
I hate my time here now. I know I may sound like an angry negative bitch now because of this long and sad confession, but in reality I'm not. I'm a fairly cheerful person and love doing fun and adventurous things! But I can't help but feel negative when I'm unhappy. Which is a lot. Sometimes, when I'm by myself after class, I feel so alone that it hurts. Like a deep painful punch in the stomach, and I feel so completely alone. Like no one understands. I've heard people say ""yeah well this is college, get used to it""....but I've seen people around campus laughing and joking and genuinely enjoying their time with one another. Maybe a best friend, a close friend?
I just cannot imagine feeling this way for the next 2 years and a half. But what can I do? I just need an answer...",,status,,2013-11-06 22:33:00,49,25,1

I stand by what I said. If you all are ignorant enough that you think the world we live in is all fuzzy and warm, then you obviously haven't seen shit. You've probably never gotten jumped walking back from a late class, or had your phone stolen by a guy on a bike or two ladies in a car. You probably haven't been raped, or had an insane woman attack your floormate near people's park when walking back from CREAM. Or had a drunk homeless person follow them home. Each one of these things I have either seen personally or heard from people I know.

You guys are right, most homeless people and mentally unstable people are good people in bad situations, but by just letting them live here on the streets and in people's park it is not a good, safe place for them, and it's not good for the people and students living in this city. Let them live somewhere else. It invites other unsavory characters to come in. Crimes are way up this year, ghetto ""people of all colors"" (blacks) from Oakland/Downtown Berkeley rob people at gunpoint ON MAIN CAMPUS. Read the newspaper. Just cuz it hasn't happened to you, doesn't mean it won't.

And thanks for telling me to jump off a bridge. That's exactly the type of inclusivity that makes living in Berkeley difficult. As soon as you have an opinion that goes against the Berkeley Golden Bear Ideals, you get shit on. What kind of free speech and acceptance is that?

Sorry your mom's mentally unstable, but at least she's working. Can you say that much for those on the streets? Drug addicts and beggars are not adding anything to our city. We need to get these people help, or something, but they shouldn't stay here.",,status,,2013-11-05 18:54:50,25,9,1

But numbers can be deceiving, it was easier in high school to see where you belonged because you always saw your friends, college is different. I can have a two hour deep conversation with someone and then see them two weeks later, only to offer a small waive before we go our separate ways. That’s the first thing I learned, you have to build the relationships you want to have and take the time to call a friend, go out to lunch or just do something. Otherwise their name and number just become simply that, a name and number, of that person you saw that one time and their face, a blur.

Still in shock at where I am today. For my good friends and family who know where I came from; who know how long I suffered, fought, cried, and begged; who knew that I spent so much time mentally and emotionally valuing myself less than the dirt I stood on. Now we look back and don't recognize that person anymore.

And yet, there are days like today where the residual pain of the past attempts to stab me in the back. And thus I'm grateful for my friends who remind me of the essential virtue of gratitude. With it, it matters not what happened years ago, but rather the path paved to the future illuminated by the scorching Armageddon of my past, serving to brighten and guide my future decisions.

The truth is, my gratitude is for the people around me. Every last bit of knowledge, love, laughter, and tears of joy have been because of you and shared with you. To my family and friends, old and new, you are the reason why I'm here today. If it was up to me a few years back, I would have been erased from this planet. When I didn't care, you did. I owe my life to you. I will be successful and make a difference in this world because it's how I'll pay it forward after those who payed it forward to me.

Without everyone, I am a shell of a man. This life has not been, and never will be, about me. It's about being with other people. It always has been, it's just always so easy to get caught up in ""what's good for me.""

Thank you for giving me the gift of laughter, love, knowledge, and friendship. Whether or not you realize it, your impact on my life has been significant.

Each time we've hung out I enjoy spending time with you more and more.

And the more we talk, the more I discover how amazing, beautiful, smart, funny, talented, and self-driven you are.  You've completely subverted what I ever thought possible for the amount of amazing qualities that can be had by one person.  And just when I thought there couldn't possibly be any more surprises, you surprise me again.  Your laugh is contagious, your smile is perfect, and your eyes are the most beautiful I've ever seen.

I want to have sex, believe me, when he's lying naked on my bed with his dick just basically calling my name, I'm just like ""Fuck me"". BUT this guy, when we're in the process of touching each other and doing all that foreplay stuff, he gets kinda sweaty and thats not a problem because its fucking hot, but then he starts smelling like B.O. and that turns me off.

Another thing is that I dont really care how I lose my virginity, because I just want to get it done and over with so that I can get to the fun stuff.  BUT this guy, uggghhh. When he gets to my room, I like to talk about random shit to see if he'll talk.  Honestly when a guy can keep up a conversation and not make me fall asleep it turns me on a bit, so I dont talk just to talk like a chick, I talk to see if he can turn me on. I always sit on my drawer just talking with a skirt while he sits down on a chair in front of me. SO I let him see my panties, and I secretly wish to be rambling on and on and then for him to just get up pull me to him and touch me and just kiss me.  BUT he says NOTHING. SO then I end up making the first move. Okay I believe in equality and everything, but I want him to take the initiative to do something first. I want him to say ""Take off your clothes and fuck me"" but he just sits there looking at the floor.  Seriously,stop being a pussy and man up.
Because this guy didnt make a move first I decided that I want to have sex with someone that's special to me because we will be comfortable with each other's bodies and wont mind telling each other what turns us on and what doesn't.
BUT last night I was so fucking lonely and I was contemplating on texting the guy to come over but then I realized that even though he knows that I want sex he'll want me to make the first move. UGH!

496760523694278_606116366092026,"It’s 8 AM and I’m walking down Dana in Berkeley, heading towards campus to start my lovely day at work. There is a little skip to my walk. Excited about the possibilities of working, I am smiling and waving hello to everybody I come across. The streets aren’t busy because it’s so early. Apartment complexes on both ends of the road fill the view. Apartment advertisement pop up in both corners of my eyes. Despite my good mood, I’m cold. You can see my breath through the icy cold winds. I’m shivering in my thick winter jacket and cuddling with my scarf to absorb the little warmth it holds. Cars are parked all along the street; I wish I had a car. Thoughts like, “if I had a car then I would have been at work much quicker” or “at least a car has a heater” cross my mind. 
So, I’m walking through and I’ve noticed a man in his car. At first glance, it looks like the man is rubbing his hands together for warmth, but when I dodge another look, I can see that he is masturbating! This Middle Eastern man, probably in his twenties to early thirties, was touching himself in public on the driving seat of what I hoped to be his car. Not only did he have the balls to do this in public, this man was fully into it! He was not subtly trying to rub one out; there was nothing secretive about his actions. It was a man who was fully naked; yes, the fucker took the time to get himself fully undressed. He looked so comfortable as if this public place was his room and open to doing whatever he pleases. His body was relaxed to a point where he had adjusted his chair backwards to optimize his masturbation experience. There was no porn on which he was focusing his sexual energy, but he was certainly enjoying himself. His smile stretched as far as his own hard dick. To make my eyes bleed more, this man was hairy, like an ape. The intensity and the fury at which he was pumping his “Peter” made him look like some Loch Ness monster ferociously attacking his dick in rage. He was beating his dick like it was a housewife in the 1950’s. 
Then comes the awkward moment when the public masturbater and the innocent bystander make eye contact. You may be asking, “what happened next?”. Well, I will share the universal phases everyone goes through when they catch someone masturbating. There are three phases one must go through to fully understand this experience. Phase one, apologize. As soon as I met eyes with this man, I immediately said “sorry” and ran. It was as if I was invading his private moment instead of him imposing his dick onto my face. Phase two begins as I try to grasp the situation at hand: anger. Angry at the dick I saw earlier, I began to stomp my feet while walking to class. Shouting, ""FUCK! I JUST SAW A MASSIVE, HAIRY, VEINY SHAFT IN PUBLIC! THIS RUINS MY WHOLE DAY!”, makes my already disturbed mind more enraged. But the further I walked away from the pervert, the more I composed myself. When the anger was all vented out, I hit the stage of full calmness. Then, I hit phase three: awe. I was in awe about the situation at hand. By the situation, I mean his penis. Yes, the huge dick I just saw. When he was masturbating, he was using two hands as his two hands didn’t even come close to covering the surface of his Sasquatch cock. The motions he was using to touch himself could be best described as akin to churning butter. In neither porn nor real life have I seen a penis this immense. I actually kind of felt sorry for him because there could never be a girl that could possibly fit his gargantuan meat-hammer inside of her. Now I see why he masturbates in public:  it’s to show off the stunning spectacle that is his most prized and cherished possession. I walked to work and started off the rest of my day as if things were normal. The event that happened to me became a funny work story among my coworkers and to them he will be known as the Cock Ness Monster.",,status,,2013-11-03 16:17:56,14,3,0

Cause after dating many Asian guys who were disappointing in size and in bed, I hoped that this would be the night where I could get my tight Asian pussy stretched out like it's never been before.

I made sure to optimize the chances I would get the chocolate dick of my dreams. The guy was well over 6 feet, an athlete, a smooth talker, and most importantly, he was from Oakland (so I'm sure he's had a lot of experience in bed...)

He comes over to my place, ready to lay it on me like Ludacris and Trey Songz in the Sex Room. We're kissing, groping, I'm super wet and he's super hard, I'm still shivering thinking about that passion...

I slowly pull down his pants, so excited to see that chocolate cock. The moment of truth was building up in my head like the epic opening of the Lion King.

I'm smiling like crazy, it's finally there, wagging in front of my face. Except...

That shit was smaller than a travel-sized lotion bottle. Maybe even smaller than even the Asian guys I've been with.

All of my pent up excitement immediately left me. I couldn't even pretend to be happy. He immediately noticed, and at that point, I told him that he needed to leave. He kept asking why, but I was so frustrated that I screamed at him to get the fuck out of my place.

I planned to take her over on a Thursday night when my roommate had discussion; so after a couple drinks, things started heating up and clothes were peeling off.  She mentioned earlier that week that she’s a squirter… from that point, I knew that I wanted to fuck her brains out until her squirting juices would flow down my esophagus, plus that’s hot as fuck.  So there I go, going down on her, licking her vagina like a thirsty cactus that’s been in the Saharan desert with no rainfall in the last 10 years. After 15 minutes of my strong muscular impaling tongue-action, she burst inside of my mouth like the bomb near Bancroft/Telegraph (if it exploded). It was hot as fuck, so since I’m a giver, I went back for seconds. Being a multi-talented, I was able to use stimulate her with my mouth and fingers at the same time, making her grab my hair back --- hearing her scream under her breathe. She shot another squirt down my throat, but this time....it tasted off.. and smelt pungent. The first one tasted more like a diluted taste, but this one had substance, like clam chowder. To my dismay, I turned on the light and across the bed-sheets and my face was full of BLOOD! It was almost like I chainsaw-massacred a cow in resident evil…. Apparently this crazy bitch just started her period as I was going down on her, making me shallow a gulp-full of period-mixed discharge. Gagging and feeling nauseous, I run down the hall into the showers, and as I’m throwing up, I look up to poster to see a Red Cross blood donation flyer.",,status,,2013-10-30 16:34:05,34,12,0

I was simultaneously blotting the oils off of my Prada moisturized chin and merging my freshly delivered SL65 AMG onto Martin Luther King from the freeway, when from nowhere this dirty filth of a human being in a Honda Civic tries to race with me!

I gasped from air as my Dior covered eyes squinted with anguish. This dirty trash gave me the finger through his unwashed Honda windows. Mr. Walmart began to flash his halogen lights at me (mind you, one of the lamps was out----illegal!!!) and when I thought the shine was magnified through my D&G eyeglasses, I didn't suffer since my auto-dimming rear view mirrors kicked in. 

I was having so much fun as I couldn't get rid of the smirk on my Chanel red lips. I stomped on the AMG pedal with my Louboutin's to activate the V12 Biturbo's massive horsepower as I could see through my D&G the trash was gone in the wind.

I wasn't done with him yet. I slowed down to 40 mph as I approached campus waiting for him to glimpse my red exclusive Nappa leather shining through his worthless eyes. Oops! As I saw him approach, I quickly followed him but accidentally hit my windshield wipers as my YSL manicured hands accidentally slipped. 

Then some fat cop in a smelly uniform pulled me over. With a disapproving look on my face, I was quick to ask him what he wanted: Money?? Tickets to the next London fashion week?

I've tried connecting with other transfer students but it's not like we can just be friends by virtue of being transfers. You'd think the case would be different with people in your own major but that's a mistake. Those people can make you seem like an outsider as much as anyone. 

Today I spotted one person i've been trying to befriend and I have good reason to believe they were avoiding me because they wouldn't look in my direction even though we were the only people around and they only responded until I essentially yelled at them. Then they acted all friendly like they honestly hadn't noticed my existence until that moment.

What am I doing wrong? How do I make the thought of being my friend less repugnant? Maybe this person thought I was romantically interested and trying to ask them out or something but hell no I'm not interested in you I already have a partner. How do I make a conscious effort of making friends without coming across as desperate? Do I need to give up my self-respect and get insanely drunk at a party I wasn't even invited to in order to make friends? Do i have to shell out hundreds of dollars to join Greek life?

496760523694278_602895676414095,"Alright, first off; let me say that this post maybe lengthy and if it's going to be a TL;DR for you, I suggest that you just move on. 

Now, me and this girl have been going out now for quite a while. We've done some pretty crazy things in bed and decided to turn it up a notch about a couple of weeks ago. She asked me if I was ever interested in doing a threesome. I know that may not be that 'crazy' for some of you, but it definitely is for me. I told her that I was very much interested in trying it and wouldn't mind at all as long as she was comfortable with it, too. 

The next thing that she requested was that she wanted it to be ""fair"" to both of us. That means that she wants to try the threesome twice; one with another girl and one with another guy. I thought that this was a fair proposition as we both get something out of it; however, I was definitely more interested in doing it with another girl for obvious reasons. 

Since we were going to be doing the threesome both ways, we did a rock-paper-scissors game to see which gender we're going to be messing around with first. Turns out that she won and we decided we are going to try with another guy first, then a few weeks later, another girl. Now, my girlfriend works at footlocker and there is this black guy that she works with who she has always found attractive. Somehow, she managed to convince him right away into joining us. Let me say that I have nothing against black people at all, but you will see later in this story how this ****ed up our relationship.

It was a Friday night and we were both pretty nervous about this whole thing, but at the same time, excited as it was a new experience for both of us. We all decided to just rent a hotel room for the night and I decided to bring some drinks and stuff to help us get to know each other. So we were all settled and spent maybe the first 30 minutes just getting to know each other and trying to break the ice. The guy seemed cool and I definitely didn't feel a negative vibe at all. After talking and talking, my girlfriend finally just said ""let's **** guys, I'm getting horny"". Me and the other guy were both in shock because she was so straight forward about it, but I thought we should play a game to try and 'ease' into it.

What a better way to 'ease' into it than playing strip poker? So I grabbed my deck of cards in my bag and decided this is how we're going to start it off. Now, I'm a pretty damn good poker player so I know I was going to be the last guy to strip. After playing a while, the other guy managed to lose on all of his hands and had to strip barenaked first. You're all going to think that I'm gay for saying this but the moment he took off his underwear, my jaw dropped. This guy was at least ****ing 13 inches big down there, seriously. And as an Asian guy who is only 6 inches big, that thing is gigantic as ****. This guy definitely fits the damn stereotype. We continued playing for about 10 minutes more until we just decided to get into it.

My girlfriend began sucking both of us off. It was weird because I noticed she seemed to be sucking him more than she was suck me; which is understandable since he's the new guy, but still, my dick was just so god damn small compared to him. To be honest, I was a bit jealous but hey, this was part of the deal and I'll get to enjoy myself two girls in about a couple of weeks. We then switched positions and my girlfriend wanted to get ****ed. She continued sucking me off while the other guy was about to **** her. As soon as he put his dick in her, my girlfriend just started screaming and moaning. She was having such an orgasm that she stopped sucking me off and just told me to watch. 

At this point, I felt REALLY jealous. The fact that he has a 13 inch dick made her ****ing scream out of her ***. This was definitely more than I was able to give to her. Still, though, I just kept thinking to myself ""don't worry, you'll get your part of the deal"" over and over. The guy continued pounding her and it my girlfriend finally said ""stop, it's my boyfriend's turn"".

So I slipped it in her and gave it to her for about 20 seconds. She then said to me ""Wow, seriously, I can't feel anything"". So I decided to go in harder but it didn't seem to do anything. The black guy then pushed me off and said to me, ""Dude, this is how you **** a *****"". He then proceeded to pound her and she was definitely enjoying it.

I really couldn't take it anymore by this point. It was clear that I wasn’t as satisfying as he was. I quickly put my clothes on and left for the night. The next day, I called her and she didn't pick up her phone. She then changed her facebook status and took off ""in a relationship"". I wanted to talk to her about it because I know it was a ***** move for me to just leave, so I went to her work place. Right when I got to footlocker, I saw her making out with the other guy as she just completely forgot about me.

Not saying that I’m the perfect guy, but it sucks that I can’t have a 13 inch dick like that. Sometimes, it sucks being Asian, but hey, I guess you gotta move on. Still, though, this ruined my relationship. Thought I would just rant...",,status,,2013-10-28 14:51:44,19,4,0

Look, I don't give two shits about your emotional state, your feelings or your inability to engage in social interaction. I don't think most people care that you're too beta to approach a member of the opposite sex, or that you feel estranged from your self-imposed social isolation. 

Stop whining about problems that you've caused and only you have the solution to. Contrary to popular belief, it may not always be your ""fault,"" but the impetus is always upon you to fix it. 

Honestly, pull your fucking self together and move on with your life, or go squander your time crying on your own facebook page. I subscribed to a confessions page, not a virtual girlfriend.

I am Mexican-American. But I just look white American. I have thunder thighs, big boobs, and a tiny bit of a belly. I have wavy hair that's kinda frizzy, scattered zits on my face, and a plain look about myself without any makeup on. When I get up and finish getting ready in the morning, I look in the mirror, and for a second, I think ""hey, I look kinda beautiful today."" Then I step outside my dorm room, I see these truly beautiful, essentially flawless girls, I look in the mirror again, and I'm suddenly hideous. I walk through campus all day thinking that people are staring at me; thinking that people are disgusted with my ugliness. When I'm walking through campus early in the morning or late at night, when it's mostly desolate, I'm fine. But when the campus is bustling, I constantly pull down my shirt, adjust my scarf, and pull my pants up, thinking that everyone's eyes are on me; that everyone is judging me. I always suck it in when I walk and I always sit a certain way in class—in a way that will make me look the least fat. So many people have said that they admire me. That they would do anything to be in my shoes. Those people think that I have it all together. But I don't. I hate myself. I'm unremarkable. I'm unbeautiful.",,status,,2013-10-27 17:21:13,3,2,0

496760523694278_600973546606308,"Since my early childhood, I've had an egregious case of yellow fever. Transferring to UC Berkeley was probably not the best step toward recovery. I can't help but fantasize sexually about even the homeliest FOBs on campus (so long as they're not fat--that's where I draw the line). I'll openly gawk at these girls, who often dress in the skimpiest or most stereotypically ""sexy"" clothing (i.e. skirts and sheer tights). Even if they notice my staring it doesn't seem to bother them because I always make sure to make eye contact--mind you, the most sexually forward eye contact I can muster. 

Let me be clear, I have no intention of speaking to these girls let alone getting to know them well enough to begin any type of physical relationship with them. Firstly, because I have a regular sexual partner already; and secondly, because I recognize from past experiences that, my strong physical attraction to them notwithstanding, I can't stand them as people. They seem to me more out of touch with reality than even liberal whites, more ensconced in their bubble of homogeneity. It's difficult to imagine that they feel any real emotions aside from the stress and excitement from a given moment. Any other emotions they project are nuanced expressions of these two basic ones.

I also recognize that this prejudice and aversion to Asian girls is a direct result of my past relationship with an Asian girl who also happens to be a Berkeley alum. Even though she's graduated and probably not even in the city anymore, I can't help but dread that I'll run into her and that she'll greet me with the same soulless affect she had when she told me she loved me and would not date anyone else when she came as a freshman and I was still stuck in high school. I soon found out the extent of an Asian girl's emotions.",,status,,2013-10-24 22:23:44,5,6,1

Back then, I did not have any feeling for you because I think you are not beautiful and not special at all. But the time have passed, and I soon realized that you have a lovely eyes and whenever I looked at those eyes, it have made me feel peace inside me. And, you have done so many amazing things and you made me thinking why a little girl like you could have done and knew so many things.Beside all of those reasons, you are so kind; and especially, when I read your info on ambassador page, I felt like I am nothing if comparing to you. So on one night without sleeping, I decided to text you and asked you that could I have a date with you; unfortunate for me, you haven't looked for anything serious yet. That's why I've became your crush until now. On the other hand, I had so many chances to express my feeling when I was with you, but it seemed like I wasted those chances; because, I did not know how to talk you, make you laugh and I was like an idiot with ESL level in front of you. And, do you know the fact that it only happens to you, but not with the other girls; I can make jokes around, talk normally with other but I always wonder why can't I do that with you. That's why you may end up thinking that I am boring annoying, and can't do anything whenever you see me. But deep down in my heart, I always wish that you could be happy with whatever you're doing and could get achievement in your life. If you can read my statement, and give me a chance to ask you out for dinner or whatever events around the campus, this time I swear to God that I will express all of my feeling to you and tell you all of my thinking about you

I used to look on at all the Cal kids with envy and tell myself that even they may be smarter than me I at least still had my social savvy. I used to criticize Cal students for not being as out going as me, comfortable around the oppissite sex, and generally well rounded.
Well, now I'm a Cal student. And, now that it's not uncommon to have a day comprised of 4 hours of class, 4 hours of work, and 4 hours of studying I understand that it is very difficult to be a social butterfly 24/7 on top of that.
I'm sorry I judged you. I'm sorry I was often defense with you at parties (because I thought you thought you were better than me), and I'm sorry I amoged you in front of your girlfriends every chance I got.
Now I'm in your shoes. I am very proud to be here in this diverse body of individuals, some of the smartest, and actually most well rounded in the world, who can still be friendly and outgoing-- even if only the slim majority of the time.

From the outside looking in you can't understand it, from the inside looking out you can understand it.
I hope I can do previous classes justice and continue the tradition of excellence that is Berkeley.

I admire this women because she raised her family by herself, and ""she was always there for me. I have now realize that that is not true. I came out to her and her first words were "" You are traumatize. Be careful old guys might rape or molest you."" Some would say that she loves me, but I doubt it. I told her that I was molested when I was 13 by a women and that was the least of her problems. She tells me that I am not gay because I am not neat. Then I guess that I am not part of my ethnicity group because I don't take pride of it. I have watch numerous gay and straight porn and I feel nothing. There is no difference. The more porn I watch the more disgusted I become with sex. It seems humiliating, but the beauty of it is that when it is love, when you do it with the person you love, the humiliating acts are no humiliating. I have never kiss a man or girl, but I have fallen in love with a straight man. I am not clingy and I respect the boundaries, but my disgusting love has help me improve as a person. I feel that I can reach the sky and do anything. Every time my mother asks me if I am sure, she brings me down. She has a basic definition of what it means to be a man. A man is not someone who fucks every girl he sees. A man is a person who protects, is not afraid to be himself. When she told me that I was a man, I felt happy. I thought she was going to say that she was proud of me for taking this step and not ending my life or for not becoming the typical gay guy who goes into the night looking for sexual partners. She taught that a man is a person who is dirty. I spent last night in front of my laptop watching straight porn hoping to become straight and nothing! I woke up this morning and I wanted to commit suicide. I wanted to kill every person I saw because they have peace, love and confidence. Yes, maybe I am not gay, but shouldn't you be happy that this love as you call it, has increase my self-esteem. There are worse things in the world than been gay. There are straight and gay people who do incest, pedophiles, and murders. I wish I could say farewell to you, but I still love. I am sorry that I am not the little boy you wanted. I know that the best thing for me is to set my distance, but I have kids who need me in their lives. If I need to live a heterosexual to see my siblings grow, then I would do it, but don't expect me to live long. Your problems are the only inheritance that I'll keep from you.

His accent and handwriting are horrendous and I don't even know where to begin to ask questions; lectures are completely different from homework/discussion problems.

Since jr. fucking loves his cereal due to his cereal palsy, he took up cooking meth to fuel his need. Along the way, he met Brock, who also loves himself some good ass breakfast. Together they created the greatest Meth empire ever. They dealt their Meth within Fruit Loops and Apple Jacks cereal boxes to get kids hooked on it. They only dealt during breakfast times to ensure the meth kept it's cereal like qualities. Hell even when Jr. cooks, he would change the purity of the meth to change the colors so it would look more like cereal. It all makes sense now. Yeah. And when anybody would cross Jr., he fucking killed them by forcing them to eat so much cereal they exploded. Walter White didn't kill Gus, if you look closely, there is a cereal box in Gus's room as Walter leaves, implying it was Jr. who actually did the crime.

You told everyone that I was me who wasn't trying and that hurt because no matter how much annoyed I was with you, I was there. I never told you to change, but you did tell me to change and that's where I had enough. I apologize about the way it ended; there was no communication and I burned the bridges a little to quickly.

496760523694278_532533413450322,"I’m not sure we should classify “prison rape” as rape anymore. I define rape as ‘forced sex + power’, and men have all the power in the world, especially white men, who are more likely to have sex forced on them in prison, which proves that karma exists.

But then I have to apply this to white women. White women have the privilege of being white, but also the disprivilege of being female. It is a clash of powerful and powerless. So how does it work out? Either white women are incapable of being raped because of their white privilege, or they are capable of being raped, and raping female people of color is DOUBLERAPE.

I’ll let you decide.

Addendum: But I’d rather not have white women weigh in on this, as I fear their bias will lead them all to say “no, we can’t be raped”, because no one wants to be able to experience the worst thing in the world.

However, something has been bugging me for some time now and I don't feel that I can comfortably share it with others in the gay community.. I believe that we should not include transgendered people in LGBT. Being transgendered is not the same as being gay or bi because it is not a sexual orientation, it is gender expression regardless of orientation. I feel that in order to better educate the public at large about the gay community, we need to disassociate anything that might confuse people of that. I know that there are still a lot of ignorant people who believe that somehow all gay men want to become women and gay women want to become men, but that is so far from the truth and I think that having the transgender community included in the LGBT community contributes to that. Don't get me wrong, I am not transphobic and I do believe in fighting for equal rights for transgendered people, I just believe that we should keep transgendered issues distinct from LGB issues. I am still going to fight for their rights, but I wish I could voice this and have a civil dialogue with others in the community about it. Aren't we civil enough to at least consider this for a moment? I am not asking to stop fighting for transgender rights as I know that there is even more to be done to correct injustices towards the transgendered community and even more confusion surrounding it; I simply feel that both the LGB community and the transgender community will make more progress by keeping our issues distinct. We can still be allies and we can still support each other; I just want to do it in a way that more clearly distinct.

Look at this university. Look at how many of us are Asian. Do you think that is any accident? Many of us came from poorer homes and faced obstacles such as language barriers. The first wave of Asian immigrants was primarily Chinese labor workers, similar to the plight of Spanish speaking immigrants today. The only difference is that we actually managed to outperform the dominant race (Whites) at almost everything that matters. We have the lowest dropout rate of high school and college, we have the lowest teen pregnancy rate, we make up the smallest percentage of the prison population, we have the highest level of education, we have the highest median income, we are the healthiest ethnic group, we have the highest percentage of married households ... do I need to go on?

And in fact i am a bit scared and nervous, i'm a shy wreck, also i'm not sure what is considered small and if that really is a big factor of enjoyment...

I visited berkeley, thinking that everything would be so wonderful, but we had two horrible tours from two very incompetent guides. The residential hall guide refused to tell us that we were lost and when we finally found the dorm, she just barged in on someone's messy dorm to show us what they looked like. The hippies and the homeless people were unnerving as well because they kept on running up to us and yelling in our faces.  I don't know. I've heard plenty of negative things about berkeley's undergrad program, but I never took them to heart, thinking that those were isolated incidences that occurred to relatively few students.  But lately, I've felt disenchanted from the whole Cal experience. I don't know if this is the school for me.  The reason why I am posting this here is because I want to have input from some current berkeley students.  Can you give me reasons (remind me) why berkeley is amazing (besides the  obvious things like it is the best public college, etc) and why I should disregard my bad experience and SIR to Cal?

I'm still in love with my high school sweet heart that broke up with me over 2 and a half years ago, she ended up cheating on me with another guy from frisco... i've been dating my high school best friend for the past 8 months but i can't seem to get the guts to tell her i'm still in love with my ex and that i'm losing feelings for her... don't get me wrong i havnt spoken or come into any kind of contact with my ex in over 1 and a half years. Worst part about the situation is i'm a senior living off campus and rent out a room in a house in el cerrito... recently 1 of the rooms opened up and I was supposed to help the home owner interview the person that answered the ad of course destiny shoots me in the head and its my ex girlfriend that walks through the door the day of the interview my heart dropped and i felt like crying but believe i kept a straight face the entire time... she introduced herself as if we were complete strangers and walked out as if nothing ever happened between us... i told the home owner that i wasnt sure if it would be a good idea to let her move in and told them, as much as it killed me, that she was a party girl and may come home late at nights and cause problems if she comes back drunk, of course this was partially a lie, but they said that they will give her a chance... today i found out she is moving in at the end of the month and her room is being renovated because there was mold under the old person's mattress, god knows what they were doing or how that appeared, and so the home owner told her if it would be okay if she stayed in my room for the first month without my consent and my ex agreed saying it was okay... I feel torn between my current gf, who has been my best friend for over 10 years now, and my ex that i have known for the past 7 years and dated for about 3...

Hear me out for a minute: White people are disproportionally wealthier than non-whites and our country as a whole will benefit greatly from having a more diverse educated society. Many of you don't realize how many times a brilliant minority student has to turn down an acceptance to an elite school because they can't find the means to afford it. Additionally, men should pay higher tuition than women since it is still true that men make more than women for the SAME job. The only exceptions I think should be for queer whites because they also are very oppressed by other whites. They are disproportionally bullied through their lives and much more likely to commit suicide that they should get a break for going to college. Furthermore, we should cut all breaks for veteran students. Military spending is the single largest portion of the federal deficit, and you want to spend MORE money on those who have participated in war? By doing so, we only encourage sending more people to fight our imperialist wars on the promise of being able to get an education, but the last thing we need is more people going to the military.
