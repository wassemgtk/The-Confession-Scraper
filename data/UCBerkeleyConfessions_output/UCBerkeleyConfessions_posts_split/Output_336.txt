that people who lift are kind of a running joke on the interwebz and even on this page.  I'm a pretty strong kid, so I get "do you even lift brah?" on a daily basis.  For many people, its a way of bettering themselves.  For some, its about making yourself look good.  For me however, its my way of escaping.

Keep in mind that for me, lifting and talking are about the only two things that I'm good at.  Can't say that I'm all that attractive, I'm smart but not a stellar student, and I've never had a million friends.  When things ever got tough, i started eating.  Eventually, I'd gained a fair bit of weight.  I wasn't "fat" (this was mostly due to broad shoulders and a decent amount of muscle), but I considered myself about 25lbs overweight.  Once I got to be serious about my sport however, I found lifting.  Eventually, I lost that fat, picked up muscle, and I found a new, healthier way of escaping life's issues.  Half of why I came to Berkeley however, was so that I could escape some of the friend issues that I dealt with in high school.

Which brings me to my roommates.  I absolutely love them to death, but they seriously don't know where the line is when it comes to jokes.  Often times it turns into a 2-on-1 kind of thing, and when my ex is in the room, a 3-on-1 deal.  I've told them each that its getting to be a bit much.  I wouldn't have an issue if it was more of a level playing field, but now, seeing as I'm not close to the kids on my floor, I don't have anyone in my life on a daily basis that doesn't give me non-stop shit.  Between them and school, lifting is really the only part of my week (of my day if i'm very, very lucky) that I actually feel good about myself.  I came to Cal so that it wouldn't have to be as much as an "escape" for me anymore.  Only now, its even more of one.

tl;dr, understand that sometimes, we don't lift to be "bros," we aren't all "curlbrah's," and we don't do it to feel like we are superior to those who "don't even lift."  Sometimes, its the only thing that keeps us from going insane.
