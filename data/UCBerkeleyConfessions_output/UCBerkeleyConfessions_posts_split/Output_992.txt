ah Dean, the petite beautiful ethnic girl in rhetoric. You intrigue me. I swear I can get lost in your chocolate brown eyes. I think you caught me staring a few times too. But I don't have the courage to talk to you. It seems like you are friends with everyone except me? Maybe we can be more than friends. And no I don't mean that rhetorically ;)
