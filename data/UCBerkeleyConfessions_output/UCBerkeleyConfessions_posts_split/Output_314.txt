Mexican-American student at Cal. I really do care about my people succeeding in life (and all minorities in general) from growing up in a migrant farm worker town my whole life before coming here. What I don't agree with is people acting hypersensitive, militant, extremely politically correct over issues that are small, historic or maybe don't even exist at all. It's better for people to be as open as possible with discussing (and joking, when appropriate) their race, ethnicity, etc. with one another and take the power out of insults than constantly worry about the right term for this thing or just acting like their definition of a certain group is better than everybody else's. The truth is, people basically have the right to express anything, so inevitably someone's almost always going to be offended by something.  There are a number of issues in our society that still need to be worked on, and  just  getting butt hurt and policed over every little joke and saying alone really isn't going to do anything.
