ARIEST weapon in this world is not a knife or a gun but it is the TONGUE.
Not only what the words can ruin the friendship, any important relationships, but most importantly, it damages his/her REPUTATION. It also creates conflicts and misunderstanding between people. Words can really hurt one person so badly when it is not true, partially true.
SO PEOPLE, PLEASE DO NOT LISTEN TO WHAT OTHERS TELL YOU ABOUT SOMEONE UNTIL YOU ACTUALLY KNOWS/SEE THAT PERSON. Because anyone can creates rumors about someone due to various reasons, e.g. jealousy, hatred... 
And to those people who like to talk shit about people/ judge a person, please stop it! Those people who likes to gossip about others are not trustable! Because imagine he/she can tells you shit about someone else, one day, he/she can turn their back and also talk shit about you! Just be aware and don't make assumptions. Don't judge someone without processing and consolidating the facts. One of the most important values to a person is their reputation. It is just unfair to judge a person without actually knowing/seeing it personally!? Isn't it?
