ike a shy guy? I'm pretty quiet and shy (to a point that my RA forgot that I even existed) and I have never been in a relationship (or for the most part, had girls notice me)
People talk about having 20,30 girlfriends (some of whose names they don't remember anymore) and having had sex with atleast twice as many more, and I am jealous of that. I hate to admit it, but I am. I guess that makes me a pervert for wanting to have sex, but so be it. But alas! I've never even known what a kiss felt like, let alone, sex.

I really want to change that. I do, honestly. I want to be that loud, cool, funny kid that gets tons of attractive girls. And I try - I do! - I try to go to parties and drink and meet people and be social, but no matter what, I feel really awkward when I try to do that, partially due to my own physical insecurities (terrible teeth, glasses, slightly overweight [although I have been working on that; lost about 15 pounds in 3 months :S], etc.), and partially due to constant rejection at any attempt to attract a girl. No matter what I do, I always end end up being the guy who makes the girl[s] breakfast and takes them home in the morning, rather than the guy who actually brings them home in the first place. I try to act like it doesn't phase me - i even made up a bullshit story to my roommates about trying to be abstinent so that they don't feel sorry for my lack of sexual activity - but the truth is: I really want to be the guy that girls find attractive and dream about. I want to be that guy girls yearn a text from and talk to their friends about. I was that guy who makes girl's stomachs fills with butterflies when they perceive me. I want to be that guy: somebody who exists only in my fantasies, someone who I can never be in real life, despite my best attempts. Someone who girls will never see anything for except a nice guy and perhaps, slightly intelligent. They say nice guys do win - in the end. But I'm tired of waiting, and I have this incredible penchant to losing. Unlike most of my friends and people I hang out with, I'm not going to know what sexual selection means, I'm not going to have the choice of playing the "dating" game, and I'm probably to end up marrying the first girl that actually pays attention to me. And this thought is KILLING me inside. 

And please don't say any of that - don't worry, you'll find someone!, etc, etc, bullshit, bullshit. That's like telling the limit of n as it approaches infinity, "oh, don't worry! You'll find an integer someday!" 
No. Just no. Stahp it. The only thing worse than false friendship is false sympathy, and the world is better off without  all of you spreading that toxicity everywhere.
