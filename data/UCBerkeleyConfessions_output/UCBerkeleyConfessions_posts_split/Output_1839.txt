got into loving this thing called trapstep music and I can'tstop listening to it!! I wish I could get into a Cal breakdancing group but I, sadly, am not toned around my core... yet. I really want to move the way that feels right to ratchet beats, and becoming a B-girl seems like the best outlet of expression.
