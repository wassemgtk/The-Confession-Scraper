e made the most amazing friend I could ask for. She lives on my floor, in the suite across from mine. We hang out ALL the time. I can't imagine life at Berkeley without her. I can tell her anything...except for this one thing. I am crazy about her. 

The only problem is, I'm a girl. Also, my family can never know because of our strict Indian culture.

I just can't help it. She is so sexy and fit. The costume she was wearing on Halloween made me so wet. I guess I'll just have to keep fantasizing about her...
