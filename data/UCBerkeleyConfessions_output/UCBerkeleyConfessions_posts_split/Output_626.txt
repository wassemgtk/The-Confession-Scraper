I realized how fucking lucky I am to go here. Lately, probably like most of you, I've been feeling extremely average. Studying for hours just to get that almost A, otherwise known as a B. To be honest, I'm not sure what happened this morning but I made a goal to do three small acts of kindness today (which I thought was a hefty goal). Little did I know how easy that was (I completed them all within an hour) and I have never, felt better. We go to one of the world's best universities, and even though we all may at times feel slightly average, look around and actually UNDERSTAND how lucky we are all to be getting an education. Our fellow students are determined to make a change, something I've finally decided to get on board. So stop feeling so fucking sorry for ourselves and go out and do something positive...even if that only means a small act of kindness per day. Go bears.
