rls in the Asian sorority, Sigma Phi Omega, cake on way too much makeup for their own good. If the government banned all cosmetic products, they would be the first ones to set themselves on fire so that people couldn't see how ugly they really look like under all those layers of foundation, concealer, powder, eyeshadow, and blush. The funny thing is that most of them still don't look better than a 6/10 with all that makeup on. 

It's superficial and gross, really, apart from the xenophobia they hold that compels them to hang out exclusively with that one just as xenophobic Asian fraternity. It's no wonder that the rest of the fraternities and sororities on campus won't give a shit about them, because those Asian Greek organizations are in their own little made-up world.
