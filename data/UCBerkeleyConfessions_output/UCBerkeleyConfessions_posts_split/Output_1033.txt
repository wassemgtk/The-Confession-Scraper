crazy motherfucker in the fsm cafe: i don't care if it is called the fsm cafe. your threatening ranting meant that I almost collapsed from low blood sugar today because i would rather not wait around for you to shoot me or whatever shit you had planned. fuck you. PS I called UCBPD on your crazy ass. i hope you get charges for disturbing my peace and meet someone named bubba in jail.
