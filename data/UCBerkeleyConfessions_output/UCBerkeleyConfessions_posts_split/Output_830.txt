post about being happy with what they have because they're privileged. I hadn't thought about it that way, the clean water I have to brush my teeth and the hair serum I use to fix my split ends or the face cream I use as treatment. I just went to the dentist earlier because my tooth hurt and I had a cavity filled to be sent home with pain killers. I couldn't eat solid food so instead I got to drink a smoothie. I keep thinking how lucky I am because of all the things I just listed, even my own extended family outside the Bay Area doesn't have anything past the clean water. So when I think about others out there, they don't even have that, clean water. Just a rant on my thoughts.
