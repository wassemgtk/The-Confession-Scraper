os Part 2:

I wrote the original piece on my outrage/generalization against Chicanos who choose "useless" majors. After reading some of the more thoughtful responses, I want to tell you that I learned a lot, and after reflecting, I wanted to thank you for changing my perspective:

It is incredibly hard to be inspired at a young age toward education, regardless of socioeconomic standing. Add in the dangerous environment, poverty, social pressure, problems at home, supporting one's family, helping raising younger siblings, etc. and the chances become evermore bleak. Add in the lack of educational resources, guidance from parents who have learned educational best practices and basic infrastructure set up for student success and the chances become everMORE bleak.

I commend you all who made it this far: gaining access to the top public university in the world.

Here's the thing that I guess I realized: I probably had so much anger because I just hate to see my fellow brothers and sisters fall through the cracks; I hate to see parents who work so damn hard only for their kids to fuck up and take it for granted and instead do drugs, hit the streets, or drop out. The small % who actually made it into college, and the even SMALLER % who made it into Berkeley, are truly special - and I think that my outrage was because I am just so worried about folks who take up majors that the job market doesn't necessarily demand.. I'm just worried! There's such a history of intergenerational struggle and sacrifice behind you getting here, and we all know that education is a means to upward social mobility, but not all educational majors are valued equally in the job market! I'm just worried man, and I really hate that I expressed my genuine concern in a way that was instead aggressive, ignorant and hateful.

I'm so sorry. I hope you all can understand. I truly did learn a lot though from all your comments.. thank you. I will carry this perspective going into the professional and social world forever, and will look at minority folks who make it through the system in a very high regard. Thank you.
