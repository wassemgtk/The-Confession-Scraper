n't really "hang out" in Berkeley, which is damn weird, wish students got some community wide events going on to liven up this damn city. Berkeley's surrounding counties are the shit though. If you are finding that life sucks in Berkeley, go explore outside the UCB bubble. If you are under 21...well...well that is unfortunate and you'll have to get more creative (get a job perhaps, instead of using your parent's money. you may learn a thing or two).
