just accepted to UC Berkeley and this page is making me reconsider attending in the fall. I go to all the other confession pages and they always have something fascinating/funny on their page, but here.. It's just obnoxious. 
 
Trying to objectify that your race is superior? Talking about how you only date Asians? Seriously, people always date within their race, so why is it such a big fucking deal? Blah, blah, blah blame white people. 

Is everyone at berkeley this snooty? 

Btw, I'm not white.
