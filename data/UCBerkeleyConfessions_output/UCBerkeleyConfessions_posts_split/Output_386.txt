eriously my roommate needs to shut the fuck up at night. If I can hear you with my head phones on setting stuff done and your Facebook messenger beeping, and you grabbing and setting down your keys you need to shut the fuck up. Just because our other roommate is a heavy sleeper and I'm not fully asleep doesn't give you the right to be loud slam things, and be an outright bitch, have some fucking respect!!!!
