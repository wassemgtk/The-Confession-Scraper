I wish I could tell one of my good friends: I really like you. In the way that I wish I could hold your hand when we walk side by side. That I think about you when I'm in class and I wonder if you think about me. That when I look at you, I dream about my future and I wonder what if... 

I think I see you clearly for who you are: a boy that cares, works hard, sings when he enters a room, and is driven by the need to help others. I showed you my fears and instead of being driven away by my insecurities, you showed me yours and we became stronger together.

These are the reasons why I try to see you every day.  

But I don't think you know my reasons for wanting to be near you. Once, I was with you and I wished you would just kiss me. You paused and asked me what I was thinking about. I said nothing and then you left. I cried in my room for two hours after that as I realized how lonely I can be with and without you. 

I guess all this doesn't matter since I hear you like someone that isn't me. So I won't tell you these things. Because I know too well that unrequited love can tear two people apart no matter the good intentions behind the confession.
