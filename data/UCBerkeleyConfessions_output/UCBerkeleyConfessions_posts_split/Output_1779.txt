o Ixta,

I secretly love you & I feel this post applies to you 
"I've never met anyone as dedicated and compassionate as he is. Sometimes I picture myself with him - having long, intellectual conversations over coffee, laughing uncontrollably in the comfort of his room over dumb ass shit, fixing his tie, etc - even though I know it would never happen. Sometimes, I want to tell him I love everything about him - the way he writes, the way he talks, the way his eyes gleam behind his glasses when his mouth spreads into a smile [& your scruffy facial hair]."

Love,
Your secret admirer
