d to run into each other a lot because of our jobs. I never tried to initiate a conversation, even though I saw you periodically throughout the last semester. Then, after a long gap, I ran into you a few times at the end of summer and you chatted me up. I was completely terrified because I found you so incredibly attractive but also quietly delighted. I think you might be an Anthropology student or maybe Classical Studies, because you mentioned spending your summer at an archaeological dig abroad. I wanted to ask you more about yourself because you seemed so interesting but I haven't seen you since August. Maybe you left your job or our schedules just don't match up. Whatever you're up to, hope you're doing well. :)
