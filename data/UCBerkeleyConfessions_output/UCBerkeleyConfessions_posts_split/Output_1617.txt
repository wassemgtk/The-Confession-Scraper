on a floor where basically every girl is some sort of asian-American, beautiful, and skinny.
I am Mexican-American. But I just look white American. I have thunder thighs, big boobs, and a tiny bit of a belly. I have wavy hair that's kinda frizzy, scattered zits on my face, and a plain look about myself without any makeup on. When I get up and finish getting ready in the morning, I look in the mirror, and for a second, I think "hey, I look kinda beautiful today." Then I step outside my dorm room, I see these truly beautiful, essentially flawless girls, I look in the mirror again, and I'm suddenly hideous. I walk through campus all day thinking that people are staring at me; thinking that people are disgusted with my ugliness. When I'm walking through campus early in the morning or late at night, when it's mostly desolate, I'm fine. But when the campus is bustling, I constantly pull down my shirt, adjust my scarf, and pull my pants up, thinking that everyone's eyes are on me; that everyone is judging me. I always suck it in when I walk and I always sit a certain way in classâ€”in a way that will make me look the least fat. So many people have said that they admire me. That they would do anything to be in my shoes. Those people think that I have it all together. But I don't. I hate myself. I'm unremarkable. I'm unbeautiful.
