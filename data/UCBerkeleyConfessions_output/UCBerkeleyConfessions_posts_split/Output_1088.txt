really understand why a guy would show all the signs that he likes you, takes you out etc etc. Then suddenly disappear. It is the fear of commitment or just did he realize that he wasn't that interested after all? Either way, why can't you just be honest with me instead of disappear off the face of the earth and leaving me wondering. I don't understand how a person cannot feel guilty about doing something like this. Seriously if you know they had feelings for you and you were displaying those feelings too- don't you at least owe it to them to tell them what's going on? & If you don't feel guilty thats fucked up.
