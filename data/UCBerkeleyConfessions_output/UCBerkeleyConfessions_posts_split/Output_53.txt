alf of all men, I want to make a sincere apology to all women who have been neglected, abused, mistreated, cheated, and disrespected in relationships. Also, I am speaking to the women who just can't seem to find the right guy. I have been speaking with women who are in these relationships, so I dedicate this to you all for being so strong when you don't even know that you are. Relationships should be a comfort zone, not where you feel uneasy. So please accept this apology and know that things will get better....
