the people who have been confessing to loneliness and having trouble making friends, I encourage you to join the Rally Committee. As someone who joined Rally Comm this fall, I can genuinely say it is the one place where everything just feels right about Berkeley. You have the whole spectrum of the Berkeley student body (rich/poor, humanities majors/sciences majors, every race) in the group interacting as one entity. Everyone on the committee are friendly and happy people who have made my transition into college much easier. Even if you aren't a sports fan or a very spirited person, there is a home for you in Rally Comm. I have made many acquaintances at Berkeley, but the lasting friendships I have made thus far are all on the committee. GO BEARS!
