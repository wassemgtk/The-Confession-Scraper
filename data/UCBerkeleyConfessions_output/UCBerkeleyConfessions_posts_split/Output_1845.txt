t you fuckers, I just saw a blind guy in the middle of the road trying to find his way to the other side WHILE THE LIGHT WAS GREEN and NO ONE SAID ANYTHING. I had to stop my bike and help the guy out while a bunch of you Berkeley students shot a glance and walked on. 

I wish I could have cunt punched some of you. If you were there that night and you did nothing, you suck at life. Take yourself out of your preoccupied little life and think about the welfare of others for a second. The dude is blind. If this helps, CHECK YOUR VISION PRIVILEGE

P.S. Same thing happened a few days ago while that cute girl with the dog was trying to cross the street. Everyone just stared while she attempted to cross the street while the light was green. I swear to God if I see something like this again and no one does anything I'm taking pictures of you and posting that shit on a tumblr called SHITHEADS OF BERKELEY.
