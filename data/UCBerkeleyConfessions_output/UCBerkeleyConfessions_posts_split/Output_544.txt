t know why people complain about Berkeley so much. Every day I walk to school, I feel grateful that I get to study at such a wonderful place. Who cares if the streets are dirty and the town is ghetto? I think those make Berkeley unique compared to other schools. I personally love how there's such a variety in our school. That's why I love Cal. <3
