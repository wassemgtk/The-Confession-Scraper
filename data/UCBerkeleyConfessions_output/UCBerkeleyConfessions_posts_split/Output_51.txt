two dumb freshman (asian guy and asian girl) studying in the Unit 2 Conference Room underground (12/17/2013),
If you're going to talk about cheating on your Math 1A final, by sitting next to each other (guy sitting to the right of the girl since she's left handed) you probably shouldn't do it in a study room where it's completely silent. Use indoor voices too cause I'm trying to study. K thanks.
