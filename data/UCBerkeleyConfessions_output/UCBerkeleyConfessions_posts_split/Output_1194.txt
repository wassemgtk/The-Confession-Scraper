coming to Berkeley I had never really encounter Asians. Thus I was open minded to coming to this high concentration of Asians because I had never been around any. So far I have observed that most Asians are full of themselves, self centered, homogenous, think they are better than everyone else, and in some cases they are very immature. I'm just wondering are there any down to Earth Asians who are fun to be around?
