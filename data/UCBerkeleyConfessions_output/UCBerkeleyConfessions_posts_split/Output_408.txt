mmate is trying to kill me.
This morning, she opened the fridge and looked at some sushi she bought, glancing at the expiration date. She then turned to me and said I could have it. 
Today at lunch, I looked at the sushi, about to enjoy a semi-decent meal on behalf of my dear roomie. 
It expired two weeks ago. Fucker.
