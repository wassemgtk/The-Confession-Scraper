t know what happened to me at college. In high school I knew everyone, I was really involved in theatre, and people seemed to like me. It felt like I was getting over my shyness. Now that I'm here, I feel like an awkward 14 year old again. I've forgotten how to interact with people. I really want to get involved in one of the dramatic student groups here, but it doesn't feel like I have it in me to put myself out there like that anymore. Fucking social inhibition, man.
