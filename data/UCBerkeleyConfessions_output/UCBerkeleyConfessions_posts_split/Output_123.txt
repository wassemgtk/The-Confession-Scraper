ot just fat people because skinny folk do this too. There's just too many people on this campus that wear clothes that don't FIT them. 

Especially those girls that wear low rise jeans and can't bend down without hold their pants up from behind or awkwardly have to bend backwards to pick something up. Or the ones with a tummy spilling over, I'm positive that isn't healthy for your organs squishing everything into something that tight. Another thing, for those with button up tops, buy a larger size because your buttons look like their going to pop off, if you have bigger bust, tailor it because I can hear the buttons screaming for mercy. 

Please, just wear clothes that fit your body. I cringe when I think about how your body is screaming for clothes that fit it and are moaning in pain.
