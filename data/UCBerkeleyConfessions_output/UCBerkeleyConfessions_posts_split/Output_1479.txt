gorgeous Saif Ali Khan doppelganger who always wears flannel and reads a quantum mechanics book every evening at east asian library, two things-
1.  Look up from your quantum mechanics book and notice me. I want to do inappropriate things to you. (Plus you look like great shaadi material- we would have the cutest Indian babies!!)
2. Be proud to be Indian, I never see you at any Indus events or parties. Don't be ashamed of your Desi heritage. Plus I want to do naughty things to your pretty face.
