ter how hard I try, I can't seem to get passing grades on the math 1a midterms or quizzes and I'm honestly losing my mind. I tried to join or form a study group a few times, but I just got awful glares whenever I asked. I get these fucking processes, but they dock me so many points and never give me enoughenough time. i doubt I'm gonna pass the class and I hate myself for being so fucking stupid and useless. I even took the class last year and had to drop it. There's no reason I shouldn't be getting A's. Kill me.
