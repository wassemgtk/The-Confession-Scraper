t fateful night of All Hallow's Eve I witnessed your graceful presence emanating such impeccable, breathtaking, heaven-sent beauty from across the room. Your piercing, carnal gaze turned me to mush and left me powerless. In an unworldly fervor, we made passionate love all over our university campus; from tumbling down the steep steps to caressing each other on top of the copy machines . I knew you were a Subway employee, because you absolutely gave me a footlong. And in a moment of pure serendipity we simultaneously climaxed at Peking Express, whilst you fed me Orange Chicken on the bare HUB floor. You then disappeared into the night, never to be seen again. So my dear love, if this was meant to be, meet at top of the Campanile tonight as the clock strikes 12.
