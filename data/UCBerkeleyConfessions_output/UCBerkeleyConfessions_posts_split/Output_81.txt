Chinese girl I met around midnight at Phi Delt’s Seven Deadly Sins, I found you pretty attractive. You were wearing a pink shirt and shorts with yellow highlights, and you had a green cellphone cover. I remember that you’re a freshman living in Unit 1. I found it admirable that you took care of your floor-mate who got pretty drunk, but it saddened me that you had to leave so soon that I didn’t have the chance to ask for your name. I would really like it if our paths could cross again so I can get to know you better.
