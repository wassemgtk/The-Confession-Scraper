community college transfer from Berkeley City College. I used to look on at all the Cal kids with envy and tell myself that even they may be smarter than me I at least still had my social savvy. I used to criticize Cal students for not being as out going as me, comfortable around the oppissite sex, and generally well rounded.
Well, now I'm a Cal student. And, now that it's not uncommon to have a day comprised of 4 hours of class, 4 hours of work, and 4 hours of studying I understand that it is very difficult to be a social butterfly 24/7 on top of that.
I'm sorry I judged you. I'm sorry I was often defense with you at parties (because I thought you thought you were better than me), and I'm sorry I amoged you in front of your girlfriends every chance I got.
Now I'm in your shoes. I am very proud to be here in this diverse body of individuals, some of the smartest, and actually most well rounded in the world, who can still be friendly and outgoing-- even if only the slim majority of the time.

From the outside looking in you can't understand it, from the inside looking out you can understand it.
I hope I can do previous classes justice and continue the tradition of excellence that is Berkeley.

Go bears.
