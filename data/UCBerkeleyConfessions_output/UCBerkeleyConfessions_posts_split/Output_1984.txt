ople STOP giving to the homeless guy who bumps music outside the Asian ghetto. I mean, there's nothing wrong with him, he sits on his ass all fucking day and does nothing. worst yet is there been a "HELP WANTED:Dishwasher" sign outside of thai basil for like the last 2 months. STOP scrounging off student (most of whom have NO income) get your lazy ass off the street and get a job! why is everyone at this school so god damn sympathetic to the homeless? admittedly there are genuine cases who need help, i'm not heartless but COME ON people open your eyes.
