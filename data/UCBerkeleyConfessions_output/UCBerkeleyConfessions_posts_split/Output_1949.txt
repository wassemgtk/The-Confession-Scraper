ad a crush on this girl for a long ass time. It's only been a few months that I've been taking some actions to show how much I care about her (e.g. asking her to dinner on valentines, sitting next to her and talking to her in lectures, etc). It's been only mildly successful in the sense that we are much better friends and I feel more comfortable talking to her now but it's sometimes hard to hold a conversation with her (e.g. she stops texting/messaging me back after a while). She doesn't show any signs (that I could tell) that she's interested in me.
I've been feeling really insecure and flirting with other girls (not that she would actually know) and I feel really horrible now. :(
