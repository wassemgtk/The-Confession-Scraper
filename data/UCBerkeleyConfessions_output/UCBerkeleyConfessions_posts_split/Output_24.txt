mes I do fall into the dark pit of thinking Berkeley is the wrong school for me—that I picked it because it was one of the most prestigious schools I got accepted to, and not because I actually wanted to come here.
The lack of fun, the awkward people, the dangerous streets, and the ridiculous grade inflation and competition (from all the pre-Haas, pre-meds, etc.) all have me regretting my choice to have come to this school.

However, I realize that I am chasing my dreams here. Berkeley was the school I wanted to go to since I was 7—before I understood anything about college rankings and Nobel prizes—and that dream is being achieved. I may be struggling in classes and some nights, I may be lonelier than I want to admit, but I'm proud to be here. I'm proud to go to other states and countries and tell people: "I go to UC Berkeley" and see the awe shine in their faces. I'm proud to be a part of a campus that's notorious for civil rights rallies, marijuana, and a phenomenal arts scene.
When it comes down to it, I got here to this point in my life—higher than 90% of the world could even imagine of rising to—and I may have some bad grades but I also have spectacular ones, and those are what I should be proud of. I don't always feel at place here but I feel lucky to even be considered a Berkeley student. And I wouldn't have it any other way.
