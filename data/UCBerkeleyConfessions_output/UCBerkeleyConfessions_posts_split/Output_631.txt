21 year old guy, and I have picked and eaten my boogers daily for my whole life.

I don't know why I do it. They just taste good to me. I always do it in the privacy of my bedroom when my roommate is not in, and I always wash my hands with soap and water after doing it.

I never understood why picking and eating your boogers is nasty. It's literally just dust, mucus, blood and bacteria, all of which coats your throat 24/7.

Your nose isn't some deadly cesspool swamp, and yet people will stick their tongues on and inside vaginas that are literally made to be acidic, bacteria-filled cesspools.
