Barch, why are you spreading agression and hate? Most of the people who confess on this page are just looking for an outlet to express some pent-up emotion; you're treating them as though they have personally offended you by not acting in a 100% cold-hearted logical way. Please, help increase the self-esteem and collaborative spirit of our community rather than pushing on people's self-hatred. Your malicious facebook comments may be well-meaning, as though "If I just point out their idiocy they'll be better people" but I believe that you are destroying their self-confidence further and pushing them further into reliance on destructive emotional states.
