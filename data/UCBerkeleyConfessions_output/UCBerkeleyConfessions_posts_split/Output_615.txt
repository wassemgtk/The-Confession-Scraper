s a certain poeticness to college.

Here are all of us: thousands of us. We come from lots of places with lots of experiences and lots of interests; diversity defines us so much that it's used to advertise the school we attend. 

And yet, even though our school prides itself on our diversity, it seems like that's just what society wants to destroy. As aforementioned, there are many academic interests at Berkeley: One person wants to study English, another Mathematics, another Molecular and Cell Biology, some EECS, Gender and Women's Studies, Physics, Rhetoric, Political Science, Anthropology... You name it, someone is studying in it here. However, to many of these, society simply says "no."

And it says "no" because the world is ruled by flimsy paper bills and tiny metal coins.

You want to study English? "No. There's no job, you'll have to be a, oh dear... a TEACHER!" You want to study Ethnic Studies? "No. What could you possibly do with that?" Rhetoric, Psychology, Music, Art History? "No, where's the money??"

Society says "yes" to the studies that lead to the jobs that create the green. Pre-Med? "Yes!" Pre-Law? "Yes!!" Engineering? "Oh, yes, please!"

We pride ourselves and our school on diversity, and yet that's exactly what our society is trying to ruin. Society has conditioned us to think not in terms of passion, or interest, but to think in terms of money and to call it "thinking logically about our futures."

I want to know when "thinking logically" stopped meaning picking what you're going to study based on what you're going to ENJOY studying. There's nothing wrong with people studying these "green-making majors" if you enjoy them, but it's upsetting that so, so many people are studying what they are just to have a "good job."

Not to mentionâ€“the terror of knowing that many of our society's future engineers, doctors, and lawyers will not be motivated by the prospects of solving problems, saving lives, and fighting for justice, but instead by paychecks with a greater distance between the dollar sign and the decimal point.
