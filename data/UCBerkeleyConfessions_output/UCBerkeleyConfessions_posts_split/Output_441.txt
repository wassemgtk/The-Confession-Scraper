ke to apologize for commenting or liking things on here and then having these sperglords on my friends list (who are NOT Cal students) commenting all over my shit and trying to make conversation with me in the comment section. I don't really respond to them because they're just shitting up the board with the typical repetitive "you don't even go here!" Mean Girls references.
So if you're not a Cal student, staff member, or alum, you don't belong here. Go get your drama from like UC Santa Cruz confessions or something.
