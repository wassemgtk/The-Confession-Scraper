g you was the worst thing that could happen in my life. You and your roommate made fun of me and you pretended to be my friend. Yesterday night when you kept postponing our encounter, I knew that your friendship is not worth my time. I guess, we were never really friends, and if we were, I was not one of you priorities. So best of luck an goodbye!
