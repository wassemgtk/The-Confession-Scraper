it very off-putting and even disturbing how academically insensitive some people can be here.

I was in the library, and a guy at the table next to me was working with his friend on something for physics (presumably 7A). They were talking about midterms for the class, and I overheard the guy say to his friend, "Wait, seriously? You didn't even at least get an A? The average was a B+, and you STILL couldn't even get an A? Wow."

That is so rude. It is NOT EVER okay for you to judge someone or ridicule someone based on their academic performance. You have no idea how hard he may have studied or how offensive you could be. It made me sick hearing that guy say that, and I was so close to saying that it doesn't make him any better of a person, nor a judge just because he did well on one test.

Stop putting your self-worth and your superiority in grades. If you think people's worth can be measured in numbers, you'll get a rude awakening while you're here.
