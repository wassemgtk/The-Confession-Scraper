o you do when you feel completely alone and isolated, when you feel as though you do not belong and should not be here? I know you really shouldnt depend on anyone but yourself in life, but it feels good to have someone to talk to, to be there for you as a friend and a mentor. I miss having that, whether it was in a relationship or with my  best friends whom have distanced themselves from me, I miss having someone to talk to about the randomest things , and yet feel like it was worth every word. I can honestly say I miss having a gf, due to the fact that I had someone who I can joke around all day with, but still have the deepest heart to heart conversations with, someone to care for me and to show interest in me, as opposed to walking around campus and feeling as though I'm the odd one out.. But what can be done when youre the shyest guy who cant even say hi? nothing. It sucks and I truly miss those feelings, but life moves on and this is part of it.
