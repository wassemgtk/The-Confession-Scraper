een reading peoples' struggles about being Chicano or about job insecurity with certain majors and I can relate. I may not have had those type of problems but I have suffered as well. I am a blonde hottie with huge boobs, a big butt, and huge curves. I've always had it easy because guys always treat me well since they want to sleep with me. A lot of things were just handed to me in life for being beautiful and that's not a good thing! I became very narcissistic because I thought I was the most beautiful and intelligent girl in the world. Now I'm getting really tired of being every guy's object of desire! It gets old very fast! I've dated some swimmers from Stanford and a guy from Harvard's Rugby team but I don't think they ever liked me for who I really am. I'm so afraid that I'm never going to find a genuine guy who loves me because of my personality. I've actually become really insecure now and I stopped dating anyone. It has been more than a year and I still haven't dated anyone nor had anymore sex. I'm just too afraid now and insecure about the way in which men perceive me. I'm pretty sure most of the Berkeley guys look at me and think I'm just a hot blonde without any brains even though I've always been driven to succeed.
