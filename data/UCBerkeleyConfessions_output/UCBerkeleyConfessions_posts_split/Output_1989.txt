out and proud gay woman, I am glad to see that society is gradually becoming more accepting though I know there is still much work to be done. However, something has been bugging me for some time now and I don't feel that I can comfortably share it with others in the gay community.. I believe that we should not include transgendered people in LGBT. Being transgendered is not the same as being gay or bi because it is not a sexual orientation, it is gender expression regardless of orientation. I feel that in order to better educate the public at large about the gay community, we need to disassociate anything that might confuse people of that. I know that there are still a lot of ignorant people who believe that somehow all gay men want to become women and gay women want to become men, but that is so far from the truth and I think that having the transgender community included in the LGBT community contributes to that. Don't get me wrong, I am not transphobic and I do believe in fighting for equal rights for transgendered people, I just believe that we should keep transgendered issues distinct from LGB issues. I am still going to fight for their rights, but I wish I could voice this and have a civil dialogue with others in the community about it. Aren't we civil enough to at least consider this for a moment? I am not asking to stop fighting for transgender rights as I know that there is even more to be done to correct injustices towards the transgendered community and even more confusion surrounding it; I simply feel that both the LGB community and the transgender community will make more progress by keeping our issues distinct. We can still be allies and we can still support each other; I just want to do it in a way that more clearly distinct. I really hope you at least consider what I have to say before responding with hate.
