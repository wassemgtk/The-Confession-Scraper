dorm room is situated near the bathroom in my mini-suite. Yesterday morning, I heard someone turn on the shower. Then, I heard some moaning and groaning sounds which sounded oddly tinny. Knowing my suite mates and their inability to even talk to a girl without acting like a six year old, I concluded that one of my suite mates was watching porn before hopping in the shower, hoping no one would hear the sounds over the shower. After 2 minutes of this excruciating ordeal, I stormed into the bathroom and yelled that if he wanted to watch porn, he should have the decency to put on headphones and leave the rest of us to study for midterms. Now the suite mate is pissed at me, and somewhat embarrassed, as he has purposefully tried to avoid eye contact with me for the past few days. I really hope my housing transfer goes through; I can't go through this anymore.
2. The same suite mate has a crush; he tries so hard to make it known. He acts like a sixth grader when it comes to crushes; he showed me that 'because everyone always looks at my phone,' he changed the name of his crush to '------' so no one would know the name of his crush. 
3. My other suite mate is a legit fag. He and his boyfriend have started showering together. I know I shouldn't be freaked out, but I am. I'm horrified by what potentially goes on in there, and don't want to be showering in an area where a cockfest took place. I really need to move soon.
4. My OTHER suite-mate is a genetic mess. He's color-blind, has a heart condition, is asexual, is allergic to alcohol, and to top it all off, he's 5'4" and 88 pounds. He also doesn't give two shits about his appearance, which makes me mad. I think every man should take a minimal amount of pride in keeping their appearance presentable. This suite mate tried to cut his hair the other day, and managed to drop the razor down the side of his head, leaving a bald spot on the side of his head. I urged him to go to a hair salon and get it fixed, but he said "it wasn't a big deal" and now walks around looking like a maniac with half of his head with a buzz cut and the other half a virtual mullet.
5. I am depressed by the lack of attractive girls here. I mean, my friend and I did a rating of the girls that entered the dining common in a period of 30 minutes, and out of 40 girls, two were worthy of a double take, translating to a 5-6 on a scale of 10. We're not even talking about HOT girls, just Attractive enough to warrant some attention. It's so sad; I don't want to lose my virginity to a girl who I will have to put a bag over her head
