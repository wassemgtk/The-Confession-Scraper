ootball team, 
You didn't win an FBS game all season. Now provided we did have the third hardest schedule, but you think you could've won at least one game. Last season coach tedford was fired for going 3-9 and upset UCLA. This year sonny dykes did have a top performing qb and offense but our defense is third to last and finished 1-11. Sounds like it's time for another coaching change! #nomoredykes
