dating a girl who was really nice, just not for me. I had no idea how to break up with her, so I made up a story about how I had a drug addiction and I had to break up with her and go to rehab in another state. Well with my luck, this made her want me even more, and it seemed like she wanted to nurse me back to health like an injured puppy. I told her that long-distance wouldn't work and we just had to break up. 

Two weeks later, we almost literally ran into each other on campus.  What's my lesson learned? Don't lie if you can't.
