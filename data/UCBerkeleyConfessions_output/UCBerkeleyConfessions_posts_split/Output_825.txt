walking to my dorm, I overheard a man telling his kids about his college experience. He told them "hey, you want to know where I lived my freshman year!" He went through Unit 1, telling his kids how the bathrooms are co-op and it was weird at first, but he got over it. This makes me realize how excited I am to share my college experience with my kids, and show them around Berkeley. I know its a little early to have kids, but think about. Your kids are going to be like wow, my mom or dad went to Berkeley. Your parents probably did that to you, but since my parents never went to college, its going to be a moment that I am looking for.
