girl in my sociology class that always feels the necessity to externalize her relationship with her boyfriend --- Fuckin stop!
I understand you are in love [go love and shit], but come on....You wear shirts that say "I love my boyfriend" , your purse says "I love my BoyFriend", your laptop, coffee mug, I am sure you also have socks and underwear that says the same way. Also, all those pictures and posts that you make out to profess your love. There is a fine line from that shit being cute and I can "aw" it but I have had enough. 
I do not need to know that you are obsessed with him. Keep it to yourself...The whole fuckin world doesn't need to know. 
I have been holding this in for years...Glad I let it out.
