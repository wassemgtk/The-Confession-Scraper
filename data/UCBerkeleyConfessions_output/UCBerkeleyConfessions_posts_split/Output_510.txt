wrong to expect my boyfriend to surprise me with a card or a small gift(like a chocolate bar) every month "anniversary rsary? " We've been together for two years now, some people think it is not necessary but I always want something but ended up disappointed because he doesn't do anything besides spending time with me. He lives an hour and a half away. I always give him a card and sometimes a gift. Am I asking too much?
