ess that I have a crush on one of my floormates. No, it's not some sexual fantasy where I want him to bang me against the wall. He is truly one of the most genuine guys I've met in my two shorts months here at CAL. He's funny, witty, awkward (who isn't), intellectual, sweet, considerate, and just overall a wonderful guy. I found out he's never had a girlfriend before (howisthatevenpossible) and I really am interested in getting to know him better. Any suggestions? He's an introvert and I'm afraid to come on too strong in fear he's scared off. I have a couple lectures with him too.
