ordered a pizza from that pizza place near campus and it smell so bad. I just leave it in the hallway and a few minutes later people take it and run laughing, ringing my doorbell and interrupting my study.Just when I think the nightmare is over and Im having alone time watching like Girls Next Door the RA comes by and says did you leave the pizza. I say no and shake my head and try to run but he picks up by the scruff of my neck and now Im punished. So what I want to know is who did it who took the smelly pizza and ruined my perfect day. come confess to me, I was dracula for halloween my friend was fox. you know where I live I need closure.
