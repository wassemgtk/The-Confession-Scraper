ople, i am really tired of what you said about how bad are you in the midterm, and you are gonna fail the class. But in fact, you did really well (much better than you said). So, STOP FUCKING LYING, just said that you are doing OK or not so BAD, then we all know that you did well. That makes me feel much better than "I think I am going to FAIL this class!!!!"
