n always tell the difficulty of a major by how many weekend trips someone in that department takes. Yea I said it, and I'm looking at you Media Studies. 5 girls on my Facebook friends list are in that major and they go home to LA almost every single weekend. 

I'm not trying to start a flame war about the usefulness of a major, but none of us can deny that some majors require more work and study than others.
