like I was fed a lie about how great college would be. I miss high school because it sucks here. I feel lonely because there's nobody that really understands me. I feel like there's some  higher power stepping into my life to fuck over all my relationships. I can't sleep. I've been having suicidal thoughts but after this past weekend they've gotten much more real and worse. I can't even drunk to escape my issues because then, I can't repress them and end up with only that on my head. I'm going to die old and alone anyway, so why wait and endure another 70 years of misery? Only reason I haven't offed myself already is because the little bit of pride I have left tells me it's the easy way out. It is. But everyday, as I go through life, bits of it just get torn away because I am invisible to everybody, especially females. Sucks to have no game. Sucks to be a nice guy. Sucks to be me. There's no outlet for all this anger and depression. I feel like I'm a ticking time bomb and I don't want to fuck up my relations with the friends I have here.
