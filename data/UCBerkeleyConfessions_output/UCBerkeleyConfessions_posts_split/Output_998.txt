this school and these people to death. And I've never been happier in my entire life. I grew up rich and privileged and thought I had everything. And now I'm eating ramen every night and working my ass off for a pittance but the people and the languages and my friends and the professors and I'm bowled over by the beauty of this campus and my God I never want it to end.
