having brunch at Cafe 3 and there was myself, a group of African American girls, and a white girl sitting at different tables. 

The African American girls were laughing minding their own business and the white girl with running shoes tied to her backpack was finishing her brunch. 

She got up and left all her shit on the table like she was at a damn ihop dining place or some shit. 

So she's getting up and one of the African American girls goes like "aye hey you, pick up after yourself no one's here to do that for you anymore." 

LOL all I have to say right now because that girl looked all stupid asking where the place for the dishes was; she claimed she didn't even know about it. She dropped plates and forks trying to take her plates. 

I want to thank those African American girls because it's the workers who have to pick up that shit. You're in fucking college clean up after your fucking self. I'd like to see your ass pick up dirty plates, food on the floor, and clean those nasty ass plates. Be more fucking considerate!!!!
