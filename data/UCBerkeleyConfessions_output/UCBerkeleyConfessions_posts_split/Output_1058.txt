ly, I found out I have this older, less tall, less good-looking brother my parents never told me about. He's autistic and lives in this mental facility thing, and he can do some pretty weird stuff, like count tooth picks on the floor and recall a bunch of dates and stuff from memory. Anyways I stole him and took him to a casino and we scored big. That's ok, right?
