girls. i get grades. i live the life. i am a solid 8/10 with ridiculous game. i am confident. i am cool. i am creative. and yet, despise all my positive qualities. i have this desperate urge to fall in love. i want to hold a girl in my arms and tell her i love her. tell her that i will be the cocoon -- the atmosphere to all her exterior problems. i will do all these things because i am passionate about love and about life. that even when trials and tribulations may be tripping others, that i can still hold my baby each night with the intentions of making everything right. 

to all those lovers out there. i am so fucking jealous. one day i hope to feel what it is to have somebody by my side who will never leave me behind. 

what do you all think? 
is love a prize? a force to be reckoned with? something that takes too much time? the ticket to life? ... whatever love is....  

lets love one another
