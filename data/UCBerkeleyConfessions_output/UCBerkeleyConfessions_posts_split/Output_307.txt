o strange how people at Cal are such big hypocrites. In all of the humanities classes we take we learn about power and privilege, not judging people based on color or class or background or group, but when I look around I see so many people making judgements about different groups. "Oh, you're in a frat? Probably not my kind of person," things like that. Like, what happened to getting to know people for who they are rather than what community they associate themselves with? It makes Cal such an isolating and lonely place, in a way. I see judgments passed day to day, I see people determining who are "their kind of people" based on the most futile of things like the way someone dresses or looks. It's sort of disheartening. I just wish we could all be fuckin friends i don't even care if that sounds cliche too many fucking people are depressed on this campus because of the judgments allotted onto them or because once people have found their groups they decide they don't have a real need to reason to be genial or attempt to create connections with more than just the people they already know. step out of your comfort zone, love like everyone you see needs your love, because i can say that my day is always made better when someone is fucking friendly. stop hustle-bustling around campus while looking at the floor and look up and smile at your peers once and a while.
