mes I wish I had someone in my bed to keep me warm at night, someone to share a slurpee with, someone who could open a tight jar of peanut butter for me, someone who could cook me dinner when I'm tired, someone who could rub my feet after a long day, someone to brush my hair when it gets all nappy, someone who could listen to me vent my heart out, someone who could love me for always and forever!! 

Just kidding I have netflix I'm good
