mmer before I came to Berkeley, I was really nervous about the size competitiveness of this place and was worried about living away from home for the first time. Then I watched Malala's address at the UN in July and realized how insanely lucky I was to be coming here at all. This was a girl, close to my age, who was shot in the head for so much as seeking out an education; and there I was, provided with the opportunity to pursue higher education in one of the world's best institutions and whining about whether or not I would be homesick. So whenever I'm slaving away over a paper or cramming for a midterm and cursing this school, I remind myself of that day, and everything seems just a little better.
