mes when I get really stressed, I eat paper.  I think I like printer paper the best, because of the smell.  And the texture.  Also, when I go to someone's house for the first time and they have hardwood floors, or like a wood panel wall, I have to at some point lick it.  It's like I have to taste that person's house.  I don't do either of the aforementioned activities in front of other people.  I feel like the paper eating thing doesn't happen enough for me to have like, full-on pica, but it's still kinda weird.
