to a small K-8th grade school in the south with ~80 kids. The teachers there would often make fun of me and tell me I was a lost cause. I'm so grateful to be at Cal because of the opportunities it offers, but I'm ashamed of the little voice in my head that tells me "you got here, this will show them you're worth more." I wish I didn't care so much about what other people think of me.
