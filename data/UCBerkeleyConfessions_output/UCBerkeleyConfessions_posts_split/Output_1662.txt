ly wish I could muster up the courage to ask you out, even though I don't really know you. I tell myself repeatedly that I'll do it, but that confidence fades as soon as you enter my sight.

What's stopping me? The fear of rejection. Always has. But if I live in fear, then nothing worthwhile will happen, and I'll continue living this sad existence in relative solitude.

So the statistics say that roughly 50% of women are single? Let's hope you're a part of that 50%. Hoping this is true, I'm going to ask you out. Now it's just a matter of when. I'll gladly step out of my comfort zone for a chance at this.
