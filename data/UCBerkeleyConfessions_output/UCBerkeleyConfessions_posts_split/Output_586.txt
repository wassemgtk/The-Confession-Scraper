et stressed by midterms, others by nerves of not getting into Haas. Others worry about relationships, and others about math. But that's not what I worry about. I worry about who/where I am goin to live next year on a daily basis. 2 months into my first year and the majority of my floormates already have their living situation for next year established. Then there's me. The only person I am actually close to is probably going to end up getting an apartment with his highschool friends, and it scares me. I don't want to live on the residence halls forever and it scares me so much and makes me cry almost every time I think about it. In fact, I'm on the verge of crying now. I don't know what to do. I just wish I was close to more people so I could know that I could count on them for this and other things. I'm scared. I don't want to be alone. I'm so scared.
