o hard to find genuine and attractive girls at Berkeley. When a girl is hot, she usually tends to either go for sarcastic or jerky-type guys and I get that - they're so used to having a good time that this is almost instinctive. And that's completely fine. But just once, I wish hot girls would be into the intellectual and deep shit too. Sure, I've found girls that DO want to talk about life and our role here, etc, etc, but more often than not, they're usually not as attractive or outgoing as the party-type girls. (btw, I should really write an algorithm on this later: the correlation between girls that party and intellectuals) But yeah, moral of the story: if you're hot, don't be afraid to "downplay" yourself and try to be intellectual! If anything, it only makes you more attractive! (or, atleast to me)
