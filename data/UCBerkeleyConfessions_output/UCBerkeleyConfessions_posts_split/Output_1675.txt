y while walking through Sproul, I was flyered to by the most charming guy I've ever met. His smile glistened in the sunlight and his genuine personality made me feel so warm on the inside. Never had I felt so welcomed and warm from a sudden encounter. Every day I see him pass by Sproul, I just wish I had the courage to talk to him. John Bui please be mine.
