and I think about babies all the time. I want children already. I have all my favorite names written out in a little notebook. I get emotional watching babies eat or sniffle or waddle or even breath! I made my mom save all my books/ toys/ clothes. Whenever I date somebody one of the first things I think about is what our children will look like and proceed to judge whether or not it is worth continuing to see them. If they don't want children then its a definite no. I can't date guys my own age because they all want to wait a decade (!) and the older ones think I'm silly. I'm not weird about it.... I would only have children with someone who wants to have them with me and whom I love. I understand I'm not currently in a position to care for them, but it doesn't stop me from wanting them. Is it really that strange for a woman to want to have and care for babies at the height of her fertility?
