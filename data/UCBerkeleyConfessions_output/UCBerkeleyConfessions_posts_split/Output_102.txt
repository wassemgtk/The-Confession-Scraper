ht of recent confessions, I think it would be wise to put up a notice on the about page urging people to call counseling and psychological services at the tang center if they are having suicidal thoughts or thoughts of harming oneself or others. A direct phone number would be good. The confession page is not a good forum for discussion about suicide, as many people are not sympathetic nor well equipped to help the original poster.
