’re in my chem 1a discussion and I just found out that you’re also in bioe 24 with me. Honestly, you are the only reason I still go to class, but why won’t you talk to me? I see you looking at me sometimes (at least I think I do), and I put in extra effort to look especially cute when I know I’m going to see you. Please talk to me, I think you’re attractive, and we both live in unit 1, so maybe we could get together some time to study ;).
