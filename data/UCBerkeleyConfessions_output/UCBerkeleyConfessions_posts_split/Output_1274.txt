ing hate the homeless, mentally unstable, or the ghetto black people in berkeley. They make me uncomfortable, and I wish the city would do something about it. I get it, Berkeley is great for being inclusive and loving and we did some cool stuff in the 60s. but it's 50 years later and the city is getting ghetto. I don't feel safe walking around town and campus because of it. we should pick up the human trash on the sidewalks.
