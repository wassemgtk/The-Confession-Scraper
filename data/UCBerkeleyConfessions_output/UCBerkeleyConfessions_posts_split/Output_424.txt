his one's for all the depressed / suicidal confessors who like to let everyone on FB know how not easy Berkeley is for you: Please, like actually I'm asking you all for your own sake and for mine, please stop. Stop it. It's not a confession, it's a soliloquy, and it's not going to make you feel any better. 

Neither are the comments from the weird ass randos who think their part time job is working for the suicide hotline. If being told by some mexican PACS major to "stay strong" in the comments of your written pity-party is going to reverse your spiraling depression, you probably weren't that depressed to begin with, and didn't need to post a 7 page short story about it on UCB Confessions. 

I'd love for you to not kill yourself, but please see a counselor or go on an introspective hike, instead of bringing everyone else a little closer to suicide by spreading your damp, depressing as fuck whining to a page that should be about who's jungle juice you peed in last weekend. This isn't the forum for you. Type "suicide" into ask.com, that might be the forum for you. 

Stay Strong! <3

And shut the FUCK UP.
