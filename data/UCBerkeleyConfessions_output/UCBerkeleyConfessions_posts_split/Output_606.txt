m an MCB student, but I'm not pre-med. I'd like to say that a lot of the pre-meds in my classes actually don't get much out of the classes required for our traditionally "pre-med" major at all.

I am passionate about science and love learning anything that pertains to science, which is why I chose this major. I thought that college was supposed to be a place where we explore our passions and get to delve into a particular subject that fascinates us.

I think it's a shame, though, that a lot of the people in my major care VERY little for the actual subject matter of the courses required for it. They care only about a letter grade on paper and will simply memorize tons of information and regurgitate it on tests, then completely forget it.

I understand that they need to care a lot about their grades for medical school admissions, but from my experience I can sufficiently say that if you are passionate enough about the actual material of a certain course and apply yourself to it simply out of this passion, then a good grade will probably come naturally. I think this is true for all areas of study and all majors. That's how learning should be. That memorization and regurgitation cycle just makes me a little sad...

It's even more sad that MCB has become this distinctly "pre-med" major that everyone flocks to as a good way to prepare for medical school and that most of these people don't give two shits about molecular and cell biology.
