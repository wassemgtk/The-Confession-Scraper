ight, I met a chick that was crying and insanely drunk at a frat party. Everybody else at the party seemed to just ignore her. Thankfully her brother was there and together we took her back. She puked quite a bit on the way back and we got weird stares as we literally carried her back her brother's place but I'm glad I was there to help. 

Anyways stranger of Unit 2 Cunningham I hope you and your sister are doing well.
