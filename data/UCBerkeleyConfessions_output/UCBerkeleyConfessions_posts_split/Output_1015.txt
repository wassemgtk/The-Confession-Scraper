white/good looking guy who is in my Geography 10 lecture and is always outside Evans before class,  I always see you around 2 unit and I believe you're in TDX. We sometimes see each other almost as if we both want to talk to each other.  I wish i could speak to you, but its hard speaking to someone who you don't know is bi gay or straight.. BLAH
