n't boys at Cal just grow a pair and approach girls? Stop staring at me, fucking say something. Trust us females when we all say that it's very attractive and when guys will approach a girl and start a real conversation. If a girl seriously blows you off for a conversation she's probably a bitch or antisocial. And no, yelling "you're hot" at girls does not count, DKE.
