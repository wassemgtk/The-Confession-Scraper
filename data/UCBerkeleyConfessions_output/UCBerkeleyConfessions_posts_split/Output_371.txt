girl with a pretty decent body, and I want to go to the gym more so I can maintain it. I know well enough that I need to mix weights with cardio instead of just staying on the treadmill for an hour every day, but I have no girlfriends that want to go in the weight room with me :( 
I never know if I'm lifting or squatting correctly and I'm always super embarassed about that... Would it be weird if I asked a guy for help and pointers in the weight room? Would I look like a slut? Lol, just voicing out my concerns.
