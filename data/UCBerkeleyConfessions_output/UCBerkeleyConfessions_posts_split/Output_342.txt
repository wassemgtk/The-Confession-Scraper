'm feeling really sad, I'll go out to buy the cheapest yet decent food I can find and eat as much as I can. Then wait for about 15-20minutes. I'll go the bathroom, turn off all the lights and throw up as much as I can. The sound the toilet makes while it flushes is calming to me. Then I'll brush my teeth and wash my face with water (all the while the bathroom is pitch black). 

Then I lay down on the floor staring at nothing while thinking about nothing or cry. Eventually I fall asleep with towels as my pillows/blankets. When I wake up I take a hot scolding shower and then I go back to reality.
