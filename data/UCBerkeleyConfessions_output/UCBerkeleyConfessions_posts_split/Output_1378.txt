was the first time my boyfriend and I tried having sex in the shower last night. My foot slipped from under me and I went down, falling forwards and hitting my open mouth against the bath faucet. I knocked out my two front teeth and loosened others. There was blood everywhere and loose nerves hanging out. I was able to get dressed and we went to the ER and told them I just lost my footing in the shower, but we haven't had shower sex since - and I don't think I ever will.

What a great Halloween night...
