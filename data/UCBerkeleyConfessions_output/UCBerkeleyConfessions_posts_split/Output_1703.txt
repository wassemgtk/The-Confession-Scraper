you i sorta had a crush on you when i was drunk, and now when im sober, you're a complete asshole and ignore me. i dont hate the rejection. im a big girl. i can deal with it. what i hate is the awkwardness. im not into drama. is this what im supposed to expect of all frat guys? grow the fuck up dude. you could be civil and pretend like nothing happened or something. but no, you probably think that if you talk to me then ill just fall in love with you. get over yourself. there are plenty of men that are hotter, smarter, and nicer.
