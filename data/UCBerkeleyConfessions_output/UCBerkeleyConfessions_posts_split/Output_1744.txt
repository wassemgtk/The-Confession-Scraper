st met in the elevator when the power went out that fateful day. We were stuck between the second and third floors of Evans for two hours, and we had a great conversation. I really enjoyed talking about our feelings so candidly, but when you couldn't hold it in anymore and pooped in the corner of the elevator, you turned beet-red and wouldn't look at me anymore. I've tried to find you again but you keep avoiding me. I want you to know that it's okay, it could've happened to anyone. I don't hold it against you for trapping me with your stench for a half-hour. I don't have many friends here so please find me again.
