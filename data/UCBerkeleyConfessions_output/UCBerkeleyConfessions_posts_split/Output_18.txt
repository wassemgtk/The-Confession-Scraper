coming to Cal, I have slept through half a final and still passed the class, blacked out many times, one time including a trip to the hospital, lost my virginity, made amazing friends, drank beer out of a strippers ass, missed a crap-load of class, danced wearing nothing but women's underwear, and pissed my bed twice due to alcohol. What a year.
