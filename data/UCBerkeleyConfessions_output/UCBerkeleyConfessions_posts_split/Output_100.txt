uldn't know this by just looking at me, but i hardly eat anything (under 500 kcal) weekdays, then binge on the weekends. i usually eat around 8000 kcal in one sitting, high and drunk off my mind. my whole body swells up on mondays. i can't walk far because my calves start to hurt but i like wearing my skinny jeans. my weight fluctuates every week. i'll be skinny on friday and show up looking like a walrus on monday. I'm ashamed of myself when i wake up sober on monday morning. i wish i could stop.
