ac transit last night and the bus driver was taking his break at the stop next to the rsf. he saw some girls with cigarettes walking by and he said "DAMN" hella loud, immediately jumped off the bus asking for a cigarette and their numbers

of course, they didn't turn around... damn I don't know whether to feel bad for him or to laugh because being a bus driver is so miserable
