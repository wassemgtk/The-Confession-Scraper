sn't a confession so much as a question..do any of you Cal guys find Indian girls attractive? I got the vibe that in my high school they did, and when I wore this pretty sari to school for diversity day, I got a lot of compliments from guys. But now that I'm here at Cal, I've been hearing really negative stuff about Indians and it's making me feel less confident in myself around guys, even though I know that I'm not unattractive. Anyway, what are your opinions?
