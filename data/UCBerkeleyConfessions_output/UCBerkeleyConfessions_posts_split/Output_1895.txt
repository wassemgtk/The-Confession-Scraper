lfriend of 7 years broke up w/ me recently. We exchanged promise rings and all about 6 months ago. She's been dating a guy for about a month didnt want to "cheat" on me so broke up w/ me. I want to get out there and try to move on or at least find some companionship/ people to talk to, but my Asian shyness keeps me from doing so
