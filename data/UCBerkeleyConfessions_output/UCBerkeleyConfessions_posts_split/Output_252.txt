to be good at school. And I would get the grades I wanted (not always easily). Even at Cal, the first few years were okay for my standards, but all of sudden this semester everything came crashing down. I get worse scores than I have ever gotten on any test in my life, unmotivated to work, and overall feel miserable. Berkeley broke me...and I don't think I can get back together... :'(
