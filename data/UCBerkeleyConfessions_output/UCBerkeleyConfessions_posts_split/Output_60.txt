else feel like their friendships and their relationships with the people around them have just gone to shit lately?  A week ago, I was fine.  Life was good, wasn't stressing too much, and for the most part, my friendships were pretty good.  And then the fire nation attacked.  and by that, I mean that my best friend (and roommate) hooked up with my ex (a floor-mate), and I've just sat here as it feels like almost every one of my major friendships here is just unraveling and I feel powerless to stop it.  I didn't do a good enough job branching out at the beginning of the year (due to just sticking with my now ex), and now that my friendship with someone that I considered my bro has been compromised, I feel as though I have next to no where to turn.  The only places that I've really been able to find a consistent source of happiness have been at the gym, at work (which is also the gym), and in the bottom of what was an alcohol-filled cup.  For me, I feel like its time to turn a new leaf, and make some new friends.  I'll still keep the old ones in my life, but I feel like I need some people that I can actually count on.  With it being dead week/finals however, I haven't got a clue as to where to start.  Any ideas?  Also, anyone else going through a similar deal?
