grad student and I have to confess that some of you undergrads are the biggest pricks I've ever met. The female students in my section would hit on me as if I give a fuck about some unattractive, sexually inexperienced nerd. And seriously you go to Berkeley, enough of your false sense of elitism. Cal aint shit. It's the research that makes Cal what it is, not the actual undergrad classroom learning that goes on because honestly, it's pathetic and dumb down. Most undergrads contribute nothing to the important research and projects. So take your head out of your big inflated ass. Go to Princeton undergrad, then you'll really feel what elitism and world class education feels like.
