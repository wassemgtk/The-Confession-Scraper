be honest ladies, if you are going to wear skin tight yoga pants/sweats you should expect guys and girls to check out your ass. No, I'm not even talking about that whole "you're asking for it dressing like that" but let's be realistic, we're all programmed to procreate. Seeing a beautiful behind makes it hard to not look. Hell I might even approach (respectfully of course) you based on your ass alone, and can you blame me with them pants on like that?
