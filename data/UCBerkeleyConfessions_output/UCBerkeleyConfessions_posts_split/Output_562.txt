t understand why there seems to be no loyalty at Berkeley. maybe it's because my high school was very small, but no matter what our first priority was having each others backs and looking out for the well being of others. I can't stand that here there seems to be an ethos of every man for himself. even on my cal team. maybe it's because it's the beginning of the year, but where are the loyalties and why the hell does no one look out for each other. where can I find loyal friends because I sure as hell haven't.
