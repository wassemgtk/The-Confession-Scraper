me I was talking really loud with my friends in the library and this  guy got at mad me and shout-whispered at me to be quiet. I was mid-joke with my friend and wasn't fully focused on what was going on, so I laughed and told him to be quiet. It was so mean, I couldn't even believe it what came out of my mouth. I felt like I was Regina George or something. Dude was flabbergasted. He immediately shut up and went back to studying. This was like 2 years ago and I still feel really bad about not apologizing. But then again, I also still laugh my face off about it. Sorry dude.
