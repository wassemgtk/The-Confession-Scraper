the world did I let you kiss me?!? OH DEAR LORD, THAT WAS TERRIBLE and I wasn't even attracted to you. I guess I just felt bad and you were being nice. And you made me feel better about myself. And I was drunk as fuck. I'm so sorry. Please don't think it as anything significant. AND PLEASE DON'T EVER BRING IT UP. EVER.
