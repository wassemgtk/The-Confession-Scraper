I'm just unlucky and the universe is sending me a sign that I shouldn't date anyone or it's true that all the good ones are already in a relationship. I swear, I've met a ton of wonderful people who I could totally see myself getting into a relationship with. We'll chat, the chemistry is good, repeat for a few days, and then it comes out they are with someone. What the fuck?!?! Where is my SO hiding at? I'm in college and it feels like everyone already has their future wives and husbands picked out.
