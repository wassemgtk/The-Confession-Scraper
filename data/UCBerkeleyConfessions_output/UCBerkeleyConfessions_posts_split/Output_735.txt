say I get butthurt all the time and it's true. But it's because I'm emotional weak and it's something I can't help myself with. I wasn't this weak before... Coming to cal made me weak and made me feel like I'm worthless. Some of my best friends joke about me and I try to joke back or brush it off, but it just hurts me. What can I do to rebuild my confidence in Cal? What can I do to be able to brush people's ignorant comments off? What can I do to stop caring so much about what others want me to do and act? I'm becoming more and more depressed as I try to seek a way out of feeling worthless, because I know I do great things and there are people who are proud of me.
