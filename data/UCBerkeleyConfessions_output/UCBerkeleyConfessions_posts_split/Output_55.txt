brown guy I met at ATO the other Saturday night:
 
The one with the Armani t-shirt, rolled up jeans and boots.You're extremely cute. I always see you studying at Main Stacks with your big white headphones. Sorry I was that drunk and that stupid, I've never been with anyone who isn't white so I was a little taken back.I really do want to hear more about NYC, please don't think I was blowing you off.

 Next time I see you at the stacks, notice me eye-fucking you.
