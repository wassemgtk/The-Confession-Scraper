black people always feel the need to blare their music to the public. Doesn't matter if it's on their phone, tablet, stereo, WHATEVER the device is they, whether its on the bus, subway, bus stop, in their cars (where they play the music at deafening levels) w/e, they feel the need for you to enjoy their music too. I got news for you though, it's fucking RUDE and INCONSIDERATE! Put some god damn headphones on like the rest of us! thank you
