my early childhood, I've had an egregious case of yellow fever. Transferring to UC Berkeley was probably not the best step toward recovery. I can't help but fantasize sexually about even the homeliest FOBs on campus (so long as they're not fat--that's where I draw the line). I'll openly gawk at these girls, who often dress in the skimpiest or most stereotypically "sexy" clothing (i.e. skirts and sheer tights). Even if they notice my staring it doesn't seem to bother them because I always make sure to make eye contact--mind you, the most sexually forward eye contact I can muster. 

Let me be clear, I have no intention of speaking to these girls let alone getting to know them well enough to begin any type of physical relationship with them. Firstly, because I have a regular sexual partner already; and secondly, because I recognize from past experiences that, my strong physical attraction to them notwithstanding, I can't stand them as people. They seem to me more out of touch with reality than even liberal whites, more ensconced in their bubble of homogeneity. It's difficult to imagine that they feel any real emotions aside from the stress and excitement from a given moment. Any other emotions they project are nuanced expressions of these two basic ones.

I also recognize that this prejudice and aversion to Asian girls is a direct result of my past relationship with an Asian girl who also happens to be a Berkeley alum. Even though she's graduated and probably not even in the city anymore, I can't help but dread that I'll run into her and that she'll greet me with the same soulless affect she had when she told me she loved me and would not date anyone else when she came as a freshman and I was still stuck in high school. I soon found out the extent of an Asian girl's emotions.
