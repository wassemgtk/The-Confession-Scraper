there all this hate between humanities and science majors? You're all wonderful people, and should explore your interests in whatever way you want to. I'm an MCB major, but I have yet to take a humanities class that didn't spark my interest. I will say this though, most of the humanities majors I've met seem to be too apprehensive to take some hard science. Guys, just try something new, you might like it.
