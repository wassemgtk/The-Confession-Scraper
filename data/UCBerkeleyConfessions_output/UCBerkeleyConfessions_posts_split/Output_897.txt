super super super super hot British Indian guy who came to my register at the concession stand at the game today: You ordered two huge diet pepsis so I refrained from flirting with you, assuming one of the drinks was for someone you were with.

But I'm sorry I kind of shot down your small talk, you were just being polite and charming (you jokingly apologized for being so picky with how much ice you wanted) and your accent sent a shock of pleasure down my spine, and I didn't really reciprocate. I wish I'd said something clever or sweet in return but I kind of shrugged you off :/ you were really attractive though, god...
