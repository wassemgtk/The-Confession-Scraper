sorry for people who drive around the residential units and anywhere on campus in general because most of people at Cal don't know how to respect the traffic laws when it comes to their turn to to cross the street. Is it that they are too full of themselves, or they are just ignorant, which is ironic given all the brilliant minds at Cal
