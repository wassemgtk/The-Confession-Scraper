FPF student who stole my wallet today (Dec. 12):
I understand that we don’t all come from similar backgrounds here and maybe things were tight for you. I get that, I really do. Quite honestly, I most likely wouldn’t have been angry if you had taken the $40 cash and just given me at least my room keys and Cal1Card. What I don’t understand is why you didn’t stop to think that maybe this decision wouldn’t just affect you. I hope you know that you making the conscious decision to take my wallet and everything in it not only ruined my day and any chances of studying for finals, but it had a negative impact on most people around me. My parents had to deal with my constant upset phone calls while they were trying to work, my roommate and suitemate had to take time out of their schedule to be available and let me in my own room, my friends had to deal with my bad mood, and the girls in my sorority house had to deal with the noise of me angrily trying to cancel my credit/debit cards as they were trying to study for finals. And not only did your conscious decision have a negative impact on these people, you made sure that I wouldn’t have a positive impact on others. When I woke up this morning, I was convinced I was going to have a good day. Who knows, maybe I would have given a homeless man some spare change or swiped hungry students in with the ID that you took from me, or even just smiled at people walking down the street and brightened their day. But you made sure this didn’t happen. So next time you find someone’s wallet on the ground, think twice about who you are really affecting when you have that choice to make. 
Sincerely, 
Everyone who could have had a good day
