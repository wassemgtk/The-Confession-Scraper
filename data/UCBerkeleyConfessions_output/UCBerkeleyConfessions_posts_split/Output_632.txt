where I live. As a transfer student who just wants to get what I can academically out if school and rejoin the real world, I can't stand the culture on my floor of yelling and being obnoxiously drunk all the time. I partied enough before coming here and want to take school seriously, but it's really difficult to not feel like a crotchety old man when everyone else is going out and I've chosen to study or have a quiet night in. I'm the same age as most people my year, but feel like I'm surrounded by children.
