two months in Berkeley, I've gotten B's on 5 midterms, learned that there is a reason EECS has a reputation for being hard as fuck, developed a small inferiority complex after realizing how average I am compared to other people, and started smoking pot regularly. Oh, and I've eaten more Asian (Thai/Vietnamese/Chinese/some other stuff) food than I've cumulatively consumed in my entire life before Berkeley. 

But even with all that, my life has improved hundredfold compared to high school, so I suppose I couldn't ask for much more.
