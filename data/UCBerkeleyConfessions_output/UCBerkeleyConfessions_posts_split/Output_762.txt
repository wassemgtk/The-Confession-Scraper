sion: I am a feminist and I have no sense of humor. I wanted to cry when I saw that 86 people liked a post joking about kicking a woman in the head. But I won't. Instead, I'm going to have babies. Lots and lots of babies. Hundreds of crazy feminist baby boys and girls in yellow gender-neutral onesies. And your babies are going to fall in love with them. And you're going to have all these militant feminist grandchildren. There's going to be income equality and free public childcare, and pink EVERYWHERE. And there's nothing you can do about it.
