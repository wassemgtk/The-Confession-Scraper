sophomore student and feel very alone here. I feel like I don't have any real friends and I don't know what to do about it. There's no one I can turn to who actually gives a shit about me. I've done everything I can such as clubs, etc....but idk. I can't seem to connect with anyone. I can't take being sad and lonely anymore, but I'm at a loss about what to do. :( I'm starting to hate college because of this.
