honest, if you want to impress your "girl" or your "boy" please can you do it outside the fucking library? I'm pretty sure your crush will be impressed at how focused you are in your studies rather than you fucking cracking at stupid posts on facebook. Please shut the fuck up. Especially the people in Moffitt Library.
