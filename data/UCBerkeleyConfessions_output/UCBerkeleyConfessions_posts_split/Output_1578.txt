a huge problem with procrastination.. Can someone please help me out? Give me advices on how I can beat this!! I am so far behind and so scared for my midterms. I attribute this to my problem for sleeping too long.. My bed is so comfortable I sleep for a long time, and then when I wake up I missed all my classes and I spend most of my time on facebook and listening to music.. Please help me. Do I need a study buddy..
