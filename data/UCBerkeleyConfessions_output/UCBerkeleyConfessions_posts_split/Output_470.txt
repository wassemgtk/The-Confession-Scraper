a typical post-gym Chipotle stop after the gym on Sunday. As I turned onto Telegraph, I saw a huge crowd outside Chipotle, and thought, “Damn. Long line today.” But after a moment I noticed they were holding signs such as “It’s not food, it’s violence,” and “Animals are people too.” The crowd was protesting Chipotle and being filmed by some local news network. I walked over and asked them what they were protesting and was met with a rehearsed spew of clichés about how I need to know where my food comes from, how corporations are evil, and intentionally practice animal cruelty. Completely unfounded crap of the sort. I asked them what they advise people to do. The response was “Stop eating animals. Everyone should be a vegetarian. Animals are not ours to eat. Trust me, you’ll feel so much better as soon as you do.”

This protest was one of the most frustrating things I’ve seen in my two years at Berkeley so far for many reasons. 

First, it is ecologically impossible for everyone to be a vegetarian. We don’t have enough agricultural land in the United States for everyone to adopt a purely vegetarian diet. If we were to expand and import, this would be far more destructive than killing animals. Agriculture is among the most destructive human practices in history. It is essentially biotic cleansing. It requires taking entire living communities and clearing them away for planting space for humans. Encouraging this mass adoption of vegetarian and veganism would do significantly more harm to the world than continuing current animal practices. 

Second, these protestors claimed that removing meat from my diet would instantly make me feel better. This is not only nutritionally false, but it is also such a wrong approach towards “saving animals.” I’ve personally known many people who are vegan here at Berkeley. I know there is a right way to be vegan, but doing it the wrong way can result in bodily harm, which I’ve also seen among my vegan friends. And removing meat from my diet so I can feel better about myself? Clearly, animal cruelty isn’t the concern here. It’s just some self-righteous circle jerk where all these people can feel good about how they’re “saving the world” by not eating animals. 

I understand that the current practices of animal slaughtering and immoral, but death is death. There is no outstandingly humane way to kill an animal. The planet would be turned into a desert in a matter of years if we had to have enough agriculture for everyone to be a vegetarian or vegan. While we can advise better practices for slaughtering animals, all these people who claim that everyone should be vegetarian/vegan really need to get off their high horses and realize that’s not at all viable.

Tl;dr: Being vegan/vegetarian doesn’t make you a superhero. Understand the implications that come with telling everyone to do the same. Protestors need to get their shit together and focus on the message of animal cruelty and how it can be avoided.
