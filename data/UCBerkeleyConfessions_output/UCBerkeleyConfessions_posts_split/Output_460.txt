time I think about killing myself, I try to hold on to the fact that it might upset and disappoint my parents and the friends I've made at Cal.

Then I remember that my disappointment in myself is so much greater than theirs is and could be, and that's why I'm like this in the first place.

But you don't say things like that, you just put your head back down and keep studying. That's how it is at Cal.
