s this guy I like. He's really beautiful with his muscular torso and them muscular legs. His body is such a work of art. He's cute and funny, yet also handsome at times. He's intelligent and I just adore him. He wears glasses so beautifully and when I see him in the morning in the bathroom and he greets me, my heart flutters with butterfly. You in Unit 1, I wanted to say, I find you attractive and I wish you paid a bit more attention to me when I interact with you. Like gosh, stop talking to other people and just talk to me. I JUST WANT TO SAY I CAN'T LIVE MY LIFE WITHOUT.
