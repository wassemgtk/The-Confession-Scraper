racist bitch who lived in room 513 last year, I just want to let you know, you are lucky to have the boyfriend you do despite all your racial slurs, yes he's Mexican but you don't have to point it out all the time when it has nothing to do with what you're talking about. Calling him a cheap Mexican for buying you roses is a bitch move, there was no need to mention his ethnicity. Thinking every Mexican drinks tequila is a racist misconception. Hope you learn to at least respect other cultures.
