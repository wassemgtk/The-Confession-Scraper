ogy majors are the subject of so much condescending shit-talking at Berkeley. As a junior economics and applied math major, I think that sociology is a much-needed field of study here in our world. 

It's important for a subset of individuals educated in social science work on the evaluation of society and social issues in order for us, as a collective society, to be informed when it's time to make decisions about things like policy, and realize that (believe it or not) unemployment and inflation in the aggregate economy aren't the only things that matter.

With that said, if I hear another naive cunt talk about how great Karl Marx is and how socialism is the key to "fixing" our society and economy, I will rip his or her fucking head off. Do you know about Marx's actual beliefs and propositions? Have you heard of China's Great Leap Forward? It's collapse? Don't talk high shit about an -ism or concept when you no fucking working knowledge about it. That goes to grad students and professors too. Don't act like Marx was some fucking shining magnate of equality and liberalism without showing your students all the historical facts.
