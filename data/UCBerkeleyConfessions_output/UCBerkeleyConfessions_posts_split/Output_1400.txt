id the meteoric rise of sexual confessions come about? Is this like post-midterm therapy due to sexual deprivation? Or is the majority of Cal a bunch of conservative suburbanites and privileged kids whose parents didn't give them the talk? Guess when you don't have to worry about taking care of yourself your entire life you end up not knowing how to take care of yourself. Masturbation? Self-soothing? Exercise? Getting a job? General social interactions through joining clubs or something? Knowing that you don't need to work so damn hard to get an A if you are in letters and sciences? (excluding engineers, biochem, physics...you guys are beasts). Sure you all may be intelligent, but damn, get some self care in for christ's sake. This page draws a picture of Cal as a teeny bopper wasteland that will soon be destroyed by some inevitable ejaculatory explosion. A lot of you live in dorms or with room mates, find a damn creative way to shamelessly punish/play with yourself time to time so we don't have to constantly read about your blue genitalia. Make a code with your roomies so they know to give you your time or something. For those who know how to handle your shit, I'd give you a high five but I am kind of occupied (multitasking FTW)
