my girlfriend... only thing i hate i can think off of the top of my head that i hate about her is that she is a VEGAN a hardcore straight up no eggs milk or cheese vegan and as you may tell i love my steak, pork, chicken and eggs... but she loves it when i cook, especially when i sacrifice my dinner for her and make us vegan tofu stir fry... sometimes she comes to my apartment in the morning to wake me up and get me to make her lunch which i do enjoy doing from time to time... my confession... sometimes i "squeeze" a little bit of cooked beef, w/e meat is available, juice that i have cooked the previous night into her food. She still thinks my cooking is "deeeeeee - lick - scious" as she says... she wonders why and i tell her its cuhz i put love into my cooking... she likes meat she just doesnt know it
