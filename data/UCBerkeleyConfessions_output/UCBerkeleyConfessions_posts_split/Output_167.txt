s one bitch wearing teal on the elevator tonight. I don't give a FUCK if I use the elevator going to the first floor, you think I didn't hear you mutter as I walk out of that premise? At least have the guts to say it to my face, bitch. 
You don't know how long I've walked/jogged/ran and you don't know where I came from, so the assumption that I'm LAZY because I'm taking the elevator only to the first floor is madness? Bitch, look at yo' fatass self in the mirror. 
Plus, I'm fucking paying, HOW MUCH? $14k a year to dorm? Home boy skillet from the mothufucking 'burbs. Check yo privileges bitch. I am not paying that much so your privileged ass can deprive me of my rights to use the building facility. You got me heated, I wanted to fucking punch yo pretty little face.

I don't know what's the big deal with First Floor residents using the facility they have a right to. Yeah, I would definitely not use the elevator when there's a bunch of people I know who are going to 4th, 5th, 6th, or so on, but damn. What's with the discrimination? We're all paying thousands of dollars NOT to use things we have full access to? How about no?

Don't judge and say we're lazy. Some people walked from the Northside to back, or probably going back from workout. But damn.. Quit being bitches and live it fuckfaces!

Love you all! Go bears! :)
