atin@s, 

Where y'all at?!? I'm a brown brother myself and every time I walk, I am on a mission to find y'all. Sometimes I walk into Subway, without being hungry, and buy a 5 dollar foot-long just to be able to talk to the brown faces behind the counter. At times, during studying, I google "latinos" so I don't feel alone in Berkeley. I walk through the neighborhoods in Berkeley trying to catch a mexican cutting grass but sadly there isn't any. There has also been occasions when I catch myself talking to a bottle of Tapatio at Cafe 3 just to get the feeling of talking to a mexican again. What upsets me the most is that Cafe 3 always has asian themed food. That shit is boo boo! Give me some pinche tamales, burritos y tacos de carne asada, enchiladas, and pozole instead of a fucking Pho bar!!! Fuck y'all.... Special shout out to the peeps in Casa Mora, the only brown in Berkeley

Sincerely, 
Your lonely Mexican
