t tall blonde guy in pike. I think you play basketball, I don't think you drink, and I always see you walking around the north-side of campus during the week. You're friend (at least I think he's your friend) Dylan told me that you would be into me. We've officially met once, at an exchange, but I have no idea if you would remember me. I would love a snuggle-buddy for these last couple days of school, and you're a perfect candidate. 

I hear you're smart . . . so I'll tell you that I'm in DG, I'm brunette, and you have my number (although you've never texted me). Find out who I am, and I'll be waiting :)
