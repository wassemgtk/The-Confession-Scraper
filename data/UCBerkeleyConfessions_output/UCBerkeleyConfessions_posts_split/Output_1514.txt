ly, girls need to suck it up and put themselves more out on the line the way guys are stereotypically supposed to do. Fucking ask me out! Don't tell me that you wished you had a year ago and now it's gone. That's so cowardly. Why do people actually believe that guys always have to ask girls to dances and ask them to dinners and pay for shit and blah blah. Isn't this Berkeley? Women be 800% more empowered and throw gender roles out of the window; I assure you nearly every guy would LOVE that approach and I'm tired of being the one who is in charge of "making the first move." Girls that know what they want, are confident, and defy gender roles are MUCH sexier than the traditional style. Gettit ladies -A guy at Cal
