that berkeley isnt the best place for this, but i wish there were more country girls here, or at least know what the country life is actually about. all the fun girls here seem to be too high maintenance and only want to party or rave or go to the city.  Where are the pretty girls who just want to hang out, have a little fun, and arent scared to get a little dirt under their fingernails? i guess this is what i get for growing up a little country.
