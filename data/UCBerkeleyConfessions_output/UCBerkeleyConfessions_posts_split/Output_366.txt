a good lecture. I love a good argument that convinces me at every subsequent point, no matter which side is making it. I love understanding every point as it comes. I love being simultaneously aware of how much academic progress I've made since I came to Berkeley, and how much more there still is to learn about all of this. 

I still can't believe I go here, sometimes.
