girl in my Poly Sci Class (yes I'm keeping your name anonymous, but you know who you are). We always say Hello to each other and smile, but nothing more. Yet we are always exchanging glances in class, the second we make eye connection we look away. Can we please stop this foolishness and hang out at least once. I mean we have hung out, but only by chance cause we have friends who are mutual friends. Since I don't have your number or have you as a friend on facebook, I am writing to you on this common page we both like (not stalking you, you mentioned you liked this page to my friend). Once again, you know who you are and who I am so please let's cut the petty eye exchanges and actually talk to each other.
