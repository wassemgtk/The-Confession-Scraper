t approach girls. All my friends say if I put myself out there, I could get whoever I want. I just lie and say that I'm not looking for a girl right now, but on the inside, I'm secretly super afraid of them. Chalk it up to growing up without any older brothers or a dad to teach me any of this. I've always been one of "the popular kids" but all my confidence evaporates when I try to ask for a number.
