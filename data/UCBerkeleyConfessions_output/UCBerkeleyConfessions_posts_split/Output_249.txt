omeone who just landed an $80k+ salary from a "stupid humanities" major, here is some real talk:
1. If you are in a major that is not inherently credible for the work force, accept it. Get the baseline GPA that you need for people not to gloss over your resume and don't worry about fighting for incremental increases. That's not what helps. Besides the sciences, very few doors are immediately closed for you just because of the name of your major.
2. Kill it on extracurriculars and work experience. Absolutely try for everything you can get, while being unique. Look for things abroad, for example. You can score paid internships in different parts of the world because you know English. That will make you stand out. Learn new skills like web design or how to use statistical databases. You need to stuff your resume with things that prove that you're more than your major.
3. You can get the best of both worlds--preserve that high GPA you get from humanities and get a good salary to set yourself up for the future.
pi. EECS kids can go suck it.
4. If you can, spend your senior year taking classes that don't require attendance, so you can interview for more positions and build skills. Fortunately, many humanities classes accommodate this handsomely.
5. Nothing you learn in your classes will actually help you. Legal/paralegal jobs don't use anything you learn in Legal Studies. Political jobs will almost never use anything you learn in Political Science. Stop using these degrees to advertise yourself in the workforce. Use your skill set to do so.
