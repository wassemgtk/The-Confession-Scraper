person who asked if it was racist that they only date Asians: No, it's not. I'm Asian, too (Chinese, to be specific) and I am not even open to dating all Asians. I only date East-Asians such as Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Taiwanese (Han people of Taiwanese nationality, not native Taiwanese), and that's about it. My mom would kill me if I brought home a Vietnamese girl or a Philipino girl, and to be honest I have never really been attracted to them anyway. I like what I like and I'm not apologizing for it. No one else should tell me who I should or shouldn't date.
