friend gets super mad at me once in awhile. Like once every five months, last time was five months ago. He throws stuff around, he drags me on the floor, he lifts me up and kind of choke me, uses his hands to cover my mouth, and get really aggressive with me. Last time he even slapped me. Every time this happens he gets really upset of himself for doing things like that to me. He regrets and tells me he won't do it again.
He treats me really nice, everyone thinks he's a good boyfriend so I've never told anyone about it. Everytime this happens I tell myself if it happens again I will break up with him, but I can never do it. I feel like one of the reasonz he gets so mad is because of me, and maybe there's something I should change. 
I don't know what i am supposed to do. Should I just break up with him since he gets quite aggressive Sometimes? Or all guys are like this?  
Little note:we have been together for little more than two years and this happens about five times. He really is a nice boyfriend.
