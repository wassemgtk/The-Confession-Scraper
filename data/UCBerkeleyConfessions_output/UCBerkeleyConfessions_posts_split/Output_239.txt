atest fear as an engineer is what people will do with the stuff I come up with. The uncertainty of whether it will be used to help or hurt other people. Planned obsolescence. Proprietary designs with the intent to exploit and hurt targeted groups of people. Corporate shuttles and the gentrification of neighborhoods. Racism, sexism, and all that other bad stuff. I may not understand it completely, but I was never exposed to this side of engineering before. Selfishness in design. Complete disregard for just everything in general. In the past I’ve only read about it. Never have I had to experience it first-hand. This is why I’m disheartened. 

Just this week I’ve read stories on people being injured or even killed because of thefts of things like iPhones or nice cars. Or lines to get the new this or that; the people who have and those who don’t, not because of money, but because of supply. The people who have waited their entire lives to get some thing only to be price-gouged at the last minute or artificially-reduced supply. A system I will be contributing to for selfish interest.

Just looking at some of the price gouging on the Free and For Sale page makes me sad that people are doing this kind of stuff and I wonder if they realize all the people they are disappointing. At this point I’m just rambling but my greatest fear as an engineer is that lose control of what I make to the selfish and greedy who will use it to hurt others, to disappoint others, and to exploit others for personal gain. My only hope is that there others out there who just want to make awesome stuff, because in the end, that’s what really matters.
