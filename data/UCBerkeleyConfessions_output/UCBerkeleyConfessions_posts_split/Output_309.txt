I was at Starbucks and a homeless man was sitting next to me as I was doing my homework. Later a couple (in there 40's maybe?) sat next to the us. As the homeless man was getting ready to leave. The man folded about $100 and said to the homeless man, "hey you dropped something! (And shook his hand)" And I said "OMG AWWW" kinda too loud by accident and everyone was staring LOL. Even though I didn't get no $100 It made my day and I'm still smiling!
