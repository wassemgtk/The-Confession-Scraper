rying to  "hard" "urban" and  "thuggish." You go to Cal. Besides Stanford, this is the least "hard" campus in the entire state. Stop being phony. Be who you are, a kid who really paid attention and cared in school. Your not fooling anyone, you don't go to Oakland and get scarred at night on telegraph lol
