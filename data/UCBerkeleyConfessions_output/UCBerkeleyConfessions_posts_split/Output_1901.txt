to go to UCB but this semester I transferred out.  you guys think your all that because you go to a UC. So  many people on this page are so hateful. I know many nice people but almost everyone I met there was so stuck up. OKAY you got into UCB, so did i, its not a big deal, do you work and shut up. this is college not high school; but many people still don't understand that. hope some of you grow up soon. If you have no empathy, one day a time will come when you need someone to be like that towards you, but you wont have anyone. Karma, its a bitch and its coming after all of you who act like that.
