ade a grand total of one friend in my first semester at Berkeley and they're a freshman to boot (I'm a junior transfer). I've tried connecting with other transfer students but it's not like we can just be friends by virtue of being transfers. You'd think the case would be different with people in your own major but that's a mistake. Those people can make you seem like an outsider as much as anyone. 

Today I spotted one person i've been trying to befriend and I have good reason to believe they were avoiding me because they wouldn't look in my direction even though we were the only people around and they only responded until I essentially yelled at them. Then they acted all friendly like they honestly hadn't noticed my existence until that moment.

What am I doing wrong? How do I make the thought of being my friend less repugnant? Maybe this person thought I was romantically interested and trying to ask them out or something but hell no I'm not interested in you I already have a partner. How do I make a conscious effort of making friends without coming across as desperate? Do I need to give up my self-respect and get insanely drunk at a party I wasn't even invited to in order to make friends? Do i have to shell out hundreds of dollars to join Greek life? I can't imagine it gets easier to make good friends here as time goes on. There's just not enough time. Should I get a new haircut? Should I buy new clothes? Should I change my major? Should I eat a peach? please respond
