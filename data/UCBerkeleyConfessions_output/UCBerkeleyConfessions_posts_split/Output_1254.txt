time we make eye contact you smile at me and of course I smile back. But what the fuck does it all mean? Are you just being friendly or are you attracted to me? I'm attracted to you. I gave you an opening last week, an excuse for us to have some time away from the classroom, but you didn't take it. Now I'm wondering if I'm reading too much into everything. 

You should understand that I can't be the one to initiate. I have... "prior commitments," as they say. But if you give me a clear sign, if you smile a little wider or sit a little closer, and I know that I'm not just imagining things, I'll go for it. You have my number and you have my email. I've been to your place and I still remember the way. So say the word, for both our sake.
