an infatuation with a womanizer and knowing this doesn't make me any wiser. He remembers me every time we come across each other and shines a smile that takes forever to recover. I dread the moment he wraps his arm around me because my brain will scream silently to leave my stupid heart be. For 15 minutes you pretend you're completely mine only to wrap yourself with another girl each time. Your dangerous kisses I desperately avoid but my stupid heart gets scared of you being annoyed. Annoyed by a screaming brain of consciousness that attempts to get rid of my stupid heart's tolerance.

Stupid stupid heart, can't you ever listen anything smart?
