I'm still in love with my high school sweet heart that broke up with me over 2 and a half years ago, she ended up cheating on me with another guy from frisco... i've been dating my high school best friend for the past 8 months but i can't seem to get the guts to tell her i'm still in love with my ex and that i'm losing feelings for her... don't get me wrong i havnt spoken or come into any kind of contact with my ex in over 1 and a half years. Worst part about the situation is i'm a senior living off campus and rent out a room in a house in el cerrito... recently 1 of the rooms opened up and I was supposed to help the home owner interview the person that answered the ad of course destiny shoots me in the head and its my ex girlfriend that walks through the door the day of the interview my heart dropped and i felt like crying but believe i kept a straight face the entire time... she introduced herself as if we were complete strangers and walked out as if nothing ever happened between us... i told the home owner that i wasnt sure if it would be a good idea to let her move in and told them, as much as it killed me, that she was a party girl and may come home late at nights and cause problems if she comes back drunk, of course this was partially a lie, but they said that they will give her a chance... today i found out she is moving in at the end of the month and her room is being renovated because there was mold under the old person's mattress, god knows what they were doing or how that appeared, and so the home owner told her if it would be okay if she stayed in my room for the first month without my consent and my ex agreed saying it was okay... I feel torn between my current gf, who has been my best friend for over 10 years now, and my ex that i have known for the past 7 years and dated for about 3... I don't know if i should tell my gf that shes moving in and i dont know what i would do if my ex came on to me only one night
