ared that at the end of it all Im not even the right person for her. Scared that I'm taking advantage of the fact that she needs someone right now. And I hate that I don't ever follow through with what I say.  And that most days I so strongly believe that when push comes to shove I don't have any friends, that I'm entirely insignificant.

So on these days (I wish I could say "those off days"), I just lie to myself: "I'll be alright". I tell myself I'm important...somehow....probably.
