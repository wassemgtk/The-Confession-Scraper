fraid to be loved. I have been emotionally abused by myself and others. I don't know how to forgive myself for the brokenness I feel. Last semester, I was extremely depressed, and he was the only one I could count on. He knew more than my friends, my family, and my roommate about how bad it really was.He was my hero, but then he walked out of my life, when the worst had passed. I didn't understand why. I learned to let it go. I thought he was gone, and now he is back. I don't know how to forgive him, but I want to. I am afraid he is going to hurt me. He tells me I am beautiful, he tells me I am  whole and not broken, he tells me I am his sunshine. It makes me cry, and I don't know why. It makes me afraid, I don't know how to be happy. I am afraid I will not let him love me, because I have yet to forgive myself for past mistakes. I also don't know if I can forgive him for leaving. He said he never wanted to leave, that he always cared. I want to believe him,but I don't know how to. I still struggle with mental health issues, and he still wants to be there. I don't understand. I don't want to learn to love myself through him.I am afraid.
