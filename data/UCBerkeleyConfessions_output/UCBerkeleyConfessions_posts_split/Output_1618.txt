you, roommate. I really do. Like seriously, we get along SO WELL. But holy fucking shit, LEARN HOW TO FUCKING CHEW. I don't want to hear you smacking your gum and chewing your food like a fucking cow. Eat with your fucking mouth closed until you swallow all of your food. The sounds you make when you eat is disgusting. It is hella fucking distracting when I'm trying to study and you're chewing hella loud on your fucking food. It literally sounds like you're sucking a dick next to me when you eat. Not exactly what I want to here when I'm solving differential equations. Oh, and while I'm on here, stop fucking burping like a neanderthal. I don't want to hear your disgusting ass burps just 'cause you think they're "impressive." WHAT THE FUCK. WHO THE FUCK DOES THAT. THAT IS NOT OKAY. IT IS OKAY TO BURP LIKE A NORMAL PERSON BUT DON'T FUCKING BURP SO THAT IT SHAKES THE FUCKING WALLS, YOU PIG! GOD DAMMIT. LEARN SOME FUCKING MANNERS!
