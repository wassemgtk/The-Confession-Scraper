re was a girl in one of my clubs, and she was by far the most beautiful person I have ever seen in my life. And it wasn't just that she was unrealistically gorgeous â€“ it was everything. Too bad by the time I was planning on talking to her, she stopped going to meetings. Just thought I should write this out on the off chance that she might see this =]
