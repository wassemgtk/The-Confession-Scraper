e is the skinny,

I am a senior year, the time when I should have everything figured out. However, that’s not the case. I know not what I will do with my life. I am pissed and confused. Pissed at myself for not being like my peers who have full-time offers, internships, etc. lined up. And its my fault to be honest, I am too damn afraid. I am afraid of what is happening to me. I am afraid of reality coming in one day and curbstomping me for not having a plan. 

I am afraid all the time. Each morning I am afraid if I will survive the next day. Afraid of being alone. Afraid that despite the friends I have helped over my time here I am alone. I see people walking up and down Sproul with their friends happily chatting away their time here. Yet I am here stuck thinking: What the fuck. But I keep moving on, isolated from the world with my earbuds I keep walking through crowded roads of Berkeley completely alone. 

I keep a good face, 9 out of 10 days I shrug it off and move on. I smile at work because that’s a part of my work description. But the moment I clock out all the lonesomeness and pain comes back. Those feelings are like vultures, they never leave me, they seek my weakest moments and they are merciless when they strike. 
I don’t want to be a burden to my friends, I don’t want them to say, “Here they go again, asking for help etc. etc.” I don’t know how many times I have run away from people closest to me. So I run away, away from my friends, afraid that they will do the same to me if I dare to come closer. 

So I am angry, at myself, at reality, at the fact that I am wasting the precious little time I have here at Cal. The clock is a ticking and yet here I am. Feeling worse than junk, knowing that the front I put up most of the time is but a charade put on for the audience of none. 
So I search for salvation in distraction, work in the library till the little house during the week, and while others drink to celebrate, well, you know the rest. 

And I know that once I wake up, again I will be dragging myself out of the gutter, somedays I succeed, somedays I fall all the way back.
