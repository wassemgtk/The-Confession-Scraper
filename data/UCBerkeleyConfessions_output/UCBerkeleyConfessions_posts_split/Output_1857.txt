I just hate my life right now. There is just so much shit going on. Like they say if you really wanted to do something, go do it. And I've done that, I've made money, I've made it to Berkeley and I have the best friends in the whole world. But I can never ever do what I truly want in life. I have always dreamt of fucking an airplane. I just want to shove my hairy dick inside those motherfucking engine propellers and cum all over it. I tried doing it once but the Army guys arrested me when they me running around the Tarmac naked. I still jack off to airplanes, but man, if i could just fuck one, i could die peacefully. Does anybody else feel this way too?
