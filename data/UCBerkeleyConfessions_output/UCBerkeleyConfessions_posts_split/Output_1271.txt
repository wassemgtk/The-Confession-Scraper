boyfriend hit me for the first time this past weekend. I kicked him in the crouch and pepper sprayed him. He cried and I spit on him while I called him a piece of shit. I walked away feeling so glad I kept to my "I'll never let a guy get away with hitting me" I made in middle school after watching my brother hit his wife the first time. 

I told him if he tried to contacting me again, I will call the police.
