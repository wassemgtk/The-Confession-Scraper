k nearly every day, sometimes before noon. I don't go to class without having a drink, and took my midterm drunk the other day. I've been going through a lot of shit outside of school and tried talking to a therapist. I found it completely worthless. I tried to find another outside of Tang, only to find that my insurance won't cover it. I guess I'll try AA meetings, but if that doesn't work out, then what? I'm at the end of my rope here, and am downing a shot as I write this. Fuck everything.
