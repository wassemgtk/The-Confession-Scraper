that insist on being politically correct all the time are so annoying. It's better to be able to joke about race, gender, etc. from time to time in casual situations, and take the power out of those insults/stereotypes about certain groups than to get fired up over every single little thing. There might be a fine line to those kinds of jokes given the setting and who's saying it, but constantly saying "you're wrong, I'm right, I'm better than you" isn't really going to do anything to improve equality either.
