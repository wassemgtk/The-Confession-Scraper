as in the library today trying to write a paper and I kept hearing this odd noise. Every 45 seconds or so it sounded like someone was trying to choke a hamster. After 10 minutes of this violent assault on my ears, I decided to go find the sick fuck torturing rodents in the library. I walked back behind those moving bookcases in stacks and saw an Asian guy hunched over in his chair at a cubicle looking down into his lap. At first I thought he was trying to erase something on his zipper with a #2 Ticonderoga, but I soon realized that the thin yellow stick between his thumb and forefinger was no pencil... at this point, he seemed to notice he was no longer alone. He let out the biggest panicked hamster scream yet and in his excitement, ejaculated onto his thick-lensed glasses. I've been experiencing some PTSD from this incident and I don't know who I can talk to... Anyone have anything like this happen to them before and have any advice on how to get over it? I've just been getting blacked out every night since then--it's the only way I can get that image out of my head...PLEASE HELP!
