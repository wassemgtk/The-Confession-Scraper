noticed that for the last few days, I've been smelling cigarette up in my room. I realized that it was caused by some people smoking outside on the benches right next to the dorm building. Also, I saw you throw out the cigarette on the ground and leaving it there. I know who you are. Next time you do that shit, I'm spraying water on you. There is a designated area to smoke, and you shouldn't throw away your cigarette like that you motherfucking douchebag.
