re a reason people b*tch about me for wearing designer clothing? Like it's not my fault I can only wear and buy Chanel, Louboutins, Burberry, Givenchy, Prada, The Row, and Balenciaga. Whenever I dress in nice clothes, I feel better...so everyone who yells at me for being who I am, work hard so you can get on my (financial) level one day. I had to do chores every day in my hometown to get my allowance from my parents. I even had to clean toilets at one point and as I was doing it, I got toilet water all over my new Saint Laurent top. Stop being bi*ches complaining about me in your cheap J.Crew, H&M, Bloomingdale's, and Nordstrom crap and learn to get a life. Pray that you won't see through my D&G sunglasses giving you the evil eye...Also, I'm selling my calf hair coat from the Burberry Prorsum F/W 2013 collection. $2800 OBO. Please call (310)246-**** and no cheeps either.
