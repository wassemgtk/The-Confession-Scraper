it that casual sex is such a bad thing? It is just a natural human activity. Why is it so important to have to be in a relationship with a person to engaged in sex? Sometimes people don't want to have strings attached when having sex.

That being said I had one casual sex encounter and one of my floor mates saw me leave with her to her apartment. This one floor mate must have blabbed about it because everyone knows and everyone looks at me as if I am some degrading person. This is just dumb because another of my floor mates started dating a guy when she was still in a relationship with another guy, but "oh it's okay because she wasn't happy". Whatever I'm not going to try to get this people to like me because they must already have a bad conception of me.
