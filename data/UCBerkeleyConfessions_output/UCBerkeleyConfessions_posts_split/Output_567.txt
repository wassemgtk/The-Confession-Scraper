eird. I have a crush on you and yet I don't want to ruin the friendship. You're a girl and so am I, which makes this more conflicting since I don't know if you're only into guys or if you dig girls too. But when we hang out the few times we do, the butterflies kinda go away. But I get them back if it's a group setting. Posting this here because, well, it's a confession and it's anonymous and I just needed to say it/write it.
