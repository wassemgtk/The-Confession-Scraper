emester I tried to commit suicide at Cal.  My whole life I believed suicide is a cowardly act and would never come close to even considering it. I was raised to see it as selfish and cowardly and firmly believed this. 

The truth is, suicide shouldn't and can't be seen this way.  It isn't someone being selfish and leaving their family, friends and loved ones, but something completely different.  One moment you are yourself, never thinking of suicide, then it hits you.  The ocean of hopelessness and the loss of any will to continue.  It cannot be adequately described.

It is real though, and not selfish.
I have everything I could need in life, I am a student athlete at Cal with plenty of friends and support and live a good life.  I do not like suicide, but I no longer look down on those who attempt or commit suicide.
