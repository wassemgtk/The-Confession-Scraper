straight male. But one night me and my best friend got fucking drunk that us two and someone we picked up from a frat agreed on a threesome. At the time we were too drunk to realize it but trust me, there were a lot of eye contact between us two (kinda inevitable), and at one unfortunate point our genitals brushed up against each other's. We talked about it this morning - it doesn't make us gay right? I don't have anything against gays - I just don't want to be recognized / feel like I am one. I mean we were both drunk as fuck. And that 3rd to our threesome told us that he's done it plenty of times before and it makes none of us gay.
