you cunts who cock block your attractive girl friends at parties: fuck you. There is a reason why she is talking to a guy. If you want to go home, go by yourself. You are an adult. You do not need an escort to walk you five blocks. Better yet, find a guy yourself to walk you home, go dance with somebody, or find some other lonely friends who are also busy cock blocking other friends to walk you home.

Next time you see your friend talking to a guy, let them do their thing. There is nothing more annoying than when two people are talking at a party and some dumb bitch comes up and pulls them away because she is too insecure to find someone. 

If the guy is ugly, I understand you are trying to save her from a horrible experience. I respect that. However, if they look like they are into each other, leave them the fuck alone. 

Thanks, 
Anyone with common sense...ever
