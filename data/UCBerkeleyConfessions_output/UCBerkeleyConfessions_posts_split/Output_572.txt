g really tired of this "I'm better than everyone else" bullshit that a majority of Berkeley kids seem to have stuck in their heads. Yes, I may not be as smart as you. Sure, down the line you might make more money than me. But how does my life and what I choose to do affect you at all? Don't be concerned about me just so you can rub your successes in my face. I don't care and neither should you because you should really just focus on yourself.
