ty girls: Listen to me... this will open up your tiny little eyes. IF you have a crush on a guy, just tell him. Or, make sure he knows. That way, when he finds out, you will also find out if he likes you back. 

DON'T keep it a secret because this happens: Guy A goes to a party and sees girl A. He tries to flirt with her but she says she can't do anything with the guy because Girl B likes him. This is retarted logic. 

Point is, when a girl likes a guy, he becomes blacklisted from every other fucking girl in that sorority and it is fucking annoying. 

Because of this, the poor guy is unable to get with any girl in that sorority just because some dumb cunt wont open her mouth and talk to the fucking guy. 

If a guy likes you, and doesn't tell you, he's a moron. Don't be a moron. This is college.

So next time you're at a party, do not tell a guy you can't do shit because your insecure ugly friend likes him. Instead, live your fucking life and stop being a cunt. 

Anyone who disagrees can handwrite your letters straight to my butthole.
