graduating transfer student and when I was at CC I thought "if I get into Berkeley or UCLA I'd be the happiest person in the world." Now I'm here, I've done well academically over the past few semesters, but I'm not happy. I feel lonely and inadequate for no apparent reason. I find myself always chasing after goals - thinking that once achieved, I'd be happy. Sadly thus far, this hasn't been the case.
