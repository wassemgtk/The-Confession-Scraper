this guy got to really know him 2nd semester. We hung out a lot together and got to know each other a lot better! I felt like we really connected and we would talk everyday! It was awesome to have someone to be able to talk to and connect with at Berkeley! But then I was always busy with homework and turned down some of his invitations to go hang out. I feel that I sort of pushed him away and now we haven't talked as much as before. Every time I see him I have this horrible feeling of retreat and sadness that we don't talk as much anymore. I wish it would go away
