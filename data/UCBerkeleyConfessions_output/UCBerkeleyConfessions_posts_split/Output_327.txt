ey is a too small place. If you're hooking up with several guys it's so hard to keep it a secret. And super awkward when you meet them at the same time and have to pretend like nothing. Also, whats up with guys thinking you're their possession just because you have hooked up a couple of times, girls always get crap for being like that so i'm just sayin girls aren't the only ones acting like that.
