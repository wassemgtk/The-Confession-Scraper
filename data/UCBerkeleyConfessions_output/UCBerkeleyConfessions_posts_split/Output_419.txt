e so selfish! 

Use an entire roll of toilet paper--each day--(which were all bought by me). And you never paid me back the money for the toilet paper. 

Blast your music when I told you I'm not feeling well and wanted to sleep. 

Eat my food and use my dishes without paying me back (for my food) or washing the dishes until a week after. 

Turn the heater to 70+ degrees every night and blasting all of our bills. 

Oh, and did I missed "not paying your rent until its overdue" 

Dude, you need to understand: "There's no such thing as a free lunch!"
