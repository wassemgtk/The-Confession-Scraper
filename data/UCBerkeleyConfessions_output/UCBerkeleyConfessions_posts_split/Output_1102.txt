in pi kapp, thanks for being such a gentleman and helping me and my friend. Guys like you are so hard to find, especially in frats, so I hope I run across your beautiful smile again. I just hate that you didn't ask me for my number and I was too scared to ask for yours because of stupid social norms :(
