ave just been having the shittest semester, surprise surprise, but I just want to smack myself for not getting my shit together sooner. Finally today I decided to leave home and venture out into the world to try to do some work. As I was walking to a cafe, I saw a homeless man sitting against a window at urban outfitters reading a book, seemingly content. And I just began hating myself for being an idiot and complaining of all the books I need to read (English major). Here is this man, using the light from a store to read and expand his mind and I'm here bitching and not doing anything just stagnant because I'm depressed. (Talking to my dad and getting upset that he just doesnt understand why i got a D on my midterm i studied for, and him telling me my only job is to go to school. )Then, I said to myself "fuck you get your shit together" it may be too late, maybe not, in the semester but finally I feel like I'm getting my motivation back. The motivation that got me into Berkeley in the first place, the motivation I once had to change the world, to live and make every moment worthwhile. I am sick of being sick and tired, I want my life back. I want to do something important and I don't want to serve you your grande mocha frap in the future. 
I hope all you that feel this way get your motivation back too from one golden bear to another. 
Love, 
Golden bear with golden hair <3
