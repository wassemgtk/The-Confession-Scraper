weeks ago, my boyfriend made plans on my birthday. I was upset and accused him of forgetting, but he said he didn't. Does that even make it any better that he remembered and still made plans anyway? I sort of got over it because I normally don't care too much for  birthdays anyway. It's now my birthday week, and he said we'd do something the day before my birthday. I asked him if he planned anything, and he said no. I'm just so angry at the fact that he put no thought into this at all. Is it okay for me to be angry at him because I'm pretty damn upset right now.
