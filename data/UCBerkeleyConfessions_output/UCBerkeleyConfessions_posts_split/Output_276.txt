my good friends was crushing on me really hard.  I only see him as a friend, but I was feeling lonely and hooked up with him one night.  I can tell he really likes me, and he took that night as a sign that I felt the same way.  Now I feel like he thinks I led him on.  How can we go back to being friends? :/
