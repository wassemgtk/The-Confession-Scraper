t go to berkeley, but I am a newly admitted freshman. I visited berkeley, thinking that everything would be so wonderful, but we had two horrible tours from two very incompetent guides. The residential hall guide refused to tell us that we were lost and when we finally found the dorm, she just barged in on someone's messy dorm to show us what they looked like. The hippies and the homeless people were unnerving as well because they kept on running up to us and yelling in our faces.  I don't know. I've heard plenty of negative things about berkeley's undergrad program, but I never took them to heart, thinking that those were isolated incidences that occurred to relatively few students.  But lately, I've felt disenchanted from the whole Cal experience. I don't know if this is the school for me.  The reason why I am posting this here is because I want to have input from some current berkeley students.  Can you give me reasons (remind me) why berkeley is amazing (besides the  obvious things like it is the best public college, etc) and why I should disregard my bad experience and SIR to Cal? I would very much appreciate any helpful feedback I get. I am very confused and stressed right now. Thank you.
