tos from my math discussion back in the first week of classes: you're super cute, nice, and easy to talk to. I do believe you still owe me a story that you couldn't finish telling me on our way home. Although I'm seeing someone now that I really like, I sometimes wonder how things would have gone if we'd had another chance to walk home together, or if I could've worked up the nerve to talk to you again when you crashed the math discussion that I regularly attend a few times. See ya' around, I guess.
