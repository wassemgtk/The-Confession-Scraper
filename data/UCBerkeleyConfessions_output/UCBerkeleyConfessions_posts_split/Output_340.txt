my friends went out for lunch today and we seen a guy eating alone. So me and my friends asked if we can join him. We all talked, ate, and laughed our asses off. We also exchanged numbers with him to keep in touch. Before we left he said, "you guys made my day because it started out as a a bad day for me, thank you!" :)
