fucking sick of people pretending they did poorly on quizzes and midterms only to get an A!! Fuck you!! Stop commiserating with us only to get all of us to pat you on the back later! Just say you think you did well or just shut the fuck up! Don't feel compelled to be in the same boat as us because when grades come out and you're the only one surprised we're going to hate you! Bitch, you know you did well!! Own it!! Also, you other bitches need to stop pretending you didn't study to get that A+ on the midterm! The take home message. . . STOP BEING FAKE!!
