people around here crying because they didn't do well on a midterm they started studying for two nights beforehand and I get really mad. I haven't gotten lower than a 87% on a midterm yet because I've put in three whole hours MINIMUM every night. All I'm saying is that if you don't study your ass off right now, don't you think you're kinda wasting this incredible academic opportunity?
