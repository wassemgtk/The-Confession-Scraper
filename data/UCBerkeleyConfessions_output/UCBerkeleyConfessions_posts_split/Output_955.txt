the main reasons why I haven't entered the dating game is that I can't find any time to allocate into being a good partner. I find myself to be somewhat of a romantic, so any casual relationships, fwb, etc just do not work out for me. When I imagine myself with a soul mate, I always picture myself spending a great amount of time loving and caring for my significant other. But with all the workload and responsibilities given to me by school and life, respectively, I don't think that I am ready for a relationship yet.
