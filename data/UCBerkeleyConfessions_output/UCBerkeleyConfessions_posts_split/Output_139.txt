ear, as a freshman, I was oh so young. I didn't know anything about the world, or let alone myself for that matter. By chance, I met a guy at this club meeting â€” you know, the earlier ones of the semester with all the ice-breakers, the awkward obligatory handshakes. It wasn't just any club meeting, though. It was safe space for queer people to meet and interact. I went alone without any expectations set, but as soon as I stepped through the doors of Dwinelle, my eyes gazed upon whom I once thought was the most handsome guy I had ever seen. 

I approached him. 
I asked him for his name. 
He asked me mine.
We talked more and more, and before we knew it, the entire night was gone. Sparks flew, and one might even say that it was love at first sight. I had finally met a guy who I found attractive, funny, and just like me. My sheltered, inexperienced self felt empowered by the very idea of finding someone special. And things went from there.

We ended up dating for 8 months. Man, we were in love. Many of those who knew of our relationship loved us together, and we even molded the minds of those who had very rigid images of gay people. Those 8 months were some of the best times I ever had. That's what I thought at the time, anyway. 

But after a petty tiff one night, he completely changed as a person. He stopped texting me, talking to me, hugging and kissing me... He no longer wanted to associate with me or my friends. When I packed my bags to go home after my last final exam in May, we kissed and cried together in the dorm stairwell. A week later, he gave me that dreadful call.

From yesterday, it has been 6 months since he broke up with me. Even to this day, I'm not sure what happened to him. Even though he has hurt (and still hurts) me so much, I care a lot about him.

When I look back, I realize how blinded I was. I projected a perfect, immaculate facade onto him, when in reality, he was a twisted, profane, immature, cowardly, lazy, depressed, and immoral person. However, I only realize these things in hindsight.

This is my main takeaway message: there is so much for you to learn from within yourself before you can even imagine looking beyond. We often think too much about others, especially when it comes to relationships. But we are all so young, and believing that we'll meet that special someone in college is unrealistic and overly idealistic. People are too complicated and impulsive at this age to know what they really want. However, to those who have found their companions, I wish you the very best. You're probably experiencing something very special.

And to all those gay guys who may feel closeted and unsure of things: don't get bogged down. If you've ever visited Grindr or Jack'd, those apps are crawling with sex addicts and people who don't give a shit about your feelings. If that's what you want, then more power to you! Have sex, meet randos from the street across yours. But you don't HAVE to live that life. Make strong friendships, be around those who matter, and have a good time here. 

You really do discover a lot about yourself in this high-strung, relentless, drug-infested place many of us call home. Thanks a ton, Cal.

Sincerely,
Your loving, pseudo-closeted gay friend
