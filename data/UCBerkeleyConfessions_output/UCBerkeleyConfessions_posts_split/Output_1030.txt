hrowing it out there - I have a huge attraction for bigger men. As a young lady at Cal who is nearly always down, it's refreshing to see a 300+ guy walk in an establishment like Chipotle as if he owns the place. 
I genuinely get hot and bothered when my teacher lectures on Taft or Garfield - wow, just typing that sentence makes me weak in the knees. I'd love to get to know a guy over a pizza or two and have him wreck my bed frame (if you catch my drift)
So big fellas, get at me. I look like a young Julia Roberts with the mouth of Ke$ha ;)
