sted this to my Facebook wall, so those who know me will recognize this.  I'm not concerned about anonymity, I just want to share this with everyone. -

Still in shock at where I am today. For my good friends and family who know where I came from; who know how long I suffered, fought, cried, and begged; who knew that I spent so much time mentally and emotionally valuing myself less than the dirt I stood on. Now we look back and don't recognize that person anymore.

And yet, there are days like today where the residual pain of the past attempts to stab me in the back. And thus I'm grateful for my friends who remind me of the essential virtue of gratitude. With it, it matters not what happened years ago, but rather the path paved to the future illuminated by the scorching Armageddon of my past, serving to brighten and guide my future decisions.

The truth is, my gratitude is for the people around me. Every last bit of knowledge, love, laughter, and tears of joy have been because of you and shared with you. To my family and friends, old and new, you are the reason why I'm here today. If it was up to me a few years back, I would have been erased from this planet. When I didn't care, you did. I owe my life to you. I will be successful and make a difference in this world because it's how I'll pay it forward after those who payed it forward to me.

Without everyone, I am a shell of a man. This life has not been, and never will be, about me. It's about being with other people. It always has been, it's just always so easy to get caught up in "what's good for me."

Thank you for giving me the gift of laughter, love, knowledge, and friendship. Whether or not you realize it, your impact on my life has been significant.

Happy Monday <3
