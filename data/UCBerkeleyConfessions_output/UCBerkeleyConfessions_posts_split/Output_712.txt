I could tell you how beautiful you look in my eyes.  Everything about you is simply stunning, and when we're together my world stands still as if there is nothing but just us two.  I'm convinced that you are my better half.  We have so much in common, and yet, there are still plenty of things that are different that keep it interesting.

The problem is, you have a boyfriend.  And I wish that it was me and not him.  I love being such good friends with you, but I have an enormous crush on you and sometimes I feel as if you feel the same way about me.  I can talk to you about anything and you know that you can do the same with me.  But this is one thing that I have been reserved about.  There have been plenty of times that I've wanted to kiss you and show you how much I really care for you, but I've refrained because I respect you too much and the fact that you're in a relationship.  I also don't want to damage our friendship if this was the wrong move.

You had mentioned something about taking chances and to put myself out there.  I was about to completely spill everything to you because I was sure that you knew that it was you I was thinking about, but then you mentioned something that made me think you really had no clue.  And so I refrained again in fear that you would take my confession the wrong way.  

You just brighten my world. When you smile and laugh I can't help but do the same because that's when you're most beautiful.  Your eyes sparkle and your smile lights up the room.  It gets me every time, time and time again. 

I'm getting to the point to where I feel like I'm just going to tell you everything. In person. About how you make my heart melt when you wish me luck with everything I have to do, and how we laugh about the same stupid things that everyone else probably thinks we're idiots for laughing at.  And basically everything that I've said in this post. You deserve to hear it, because you're that incredible to me.
