a month ago my bf and I were having sex before he left CA for work. Obviously we were having GREAT, HOT sex and we are not going to see each other for a while so that made it much more passionate and shit. Well after we gave each other some oral sex he got on top and was doing me hard then we did it doggie style so I decided to give him a break and ride him since thats how I climax before he does... but I got too excited and when his penis slipped out my vagina it went in through the wrong hole(butt hole to be clear)... HOLY CRAP nothing has ever hurt that much! I wanted to stop and he asked me if I wanted to stop but I wanted to satisfy him and I waited till he came inside me and I just pretended like I was fine... after we were done I put my panties on and I went to his bathroom... and I was bleeding  and had a cut on my butt hole... I just want to know if this has happened to anyone before? Like I feel as if my butt hole is no longer the same!! btw, I miss you so much baby. I cant wait to see you again and hold you while we eat ice cream and watch How I Met Your Mother as well as The Big Bang Theory.
