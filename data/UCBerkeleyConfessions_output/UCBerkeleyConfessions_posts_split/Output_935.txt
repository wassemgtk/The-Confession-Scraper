m a girl. Maybe it's because I'm a virgin, but I get scared whenever I see male-female porn; I feel like it would just hurt a lot. So I've been only masturbating to lesbian porn for the past few years and recently when I saw my roommate asleep I felt an urge to kiss her and more. Does this mean I'm a lesbian? I don't know if I'll be able to know until I have sex with a guy.
