kinda silly doing this but here goes nothing! To the cute boy in the Basquiat shirt at Hoyt's 1969 Party last Friday. (Hey Arnold?)  

I remember us talking about our mutual love for Getz/Gilberto and James Blake and our difficulties running more than a mile. 

I told you we should hang out sometime and you told me I was pretty.

And then my brain turned to mush, your roommates left to get food, and I forgot to get your number. :X 

Why is it that when I think about our conversation I still canâ€™t help but smile inside?
