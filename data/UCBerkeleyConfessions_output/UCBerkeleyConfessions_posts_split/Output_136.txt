ried really hard to fit in on campus, but even though I've joined a bunch of campus groups, I still feel like I haven't quite found my people.  I'm the kind of person who gets invited along with the group, but never really asked to hang out.  I don't know what I'm doing wrong, but I'm really tired of feeling like the odd one out and being bailed on.
