ll a virgin right and this guy was like my fuck buddy but I flaked out at the last minute.  
I want to have sex, believe me, when he's lying naked on my bed with his dick just basically calling my name, I'm just like "Fuck me". BUT this guy, when we're in the process of touching each other and doing all that foreplay stuff, he gets kinda sweaty and thats not a problem because its fucking hot, but then he starts smelling like B.O. and that turns me off. SO I ended it, because I just lost my urge to do anything with him when he smelled.  Another thing is that I dont really care how I lose my virginity, because I just want to get it done and over with so that I can get to the fun stuff.  BUT this guy, uggghhh. When he gets to my room, I like to talk about random shit to see if he'll talk.  Honestly when a guy can keep up a conversation and not make me fall asleep it turns me on a bit, so I dont talk just to talk like a chick, I talk to see if he can turn me on. I always sit on my drawer just talking with a skirt while he sits down on a chair in front of me. SO I let him see my panties, and I secretly wish to be rambling on and on and then for him to just get up pull me to him and touch me and just kiss me.  BUT he says NOTHING. SO then I end up making the first move. Okay I believe in equality and everything, but I want him to take the initiative to do something first. I want him to say "Take off your clothes and fuck me" but he just sits there looking at the floor.  Seriously,stop being a pussy and man up.
Because this guy didnt make a move first I decided that I want to have sex with someone that's special to me because we will be comfortable with each other's bodies and wont mind telling each other what turns us on and what doesn't.
BUT last night I was so fucking lonely and I was contemplating on texting the guy to come over but then I realized that even though he knows that I want sex he'll want me to make the first move. UGH!
So should I just do the deed with this guy or wait for the guy who will actually step up?
