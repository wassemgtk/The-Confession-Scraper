arrived here I thought I'd be entering a whole new world where stupidity and ignorance were shunned. I expected to be surrounded by peers befitting my own intellect, but instead this place is over saturated with people whose collective IQ is probably less than a three digit number. The sheer amount of idiocy I see on a day to day basis absolutely stupefies me. Wasn't Berkeley supposed to be the opposite of all that? What has the world come to? Realistically though, Stanford and the Ivys probably have a higher idiot to intellectual ratio than us by far, so there's that. 

LONG LIVE CHANCELLOR DIRKS!

Ps that girl from the fifth floor of Moffitt, your brain game is mad nasty. Keep it real.
