it was just suppose to be hook-ups but I can't believe I fell for you.  The way you held me in your arms while we slept together during the night was something most guys don't do or they just leave.  But you didn't.  I really appreciated it and I told you I had felt something towards you and I had hoped you had felt something to, even after we met again and had dinner with your friends.  But I guess not.  It took a lot for me to ask you out on that date.  I wish you had said yes.  :(
