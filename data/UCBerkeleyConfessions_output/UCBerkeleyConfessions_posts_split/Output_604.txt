random girl who was crying at late night- I hope you are alright. Just know that there are so many people out there that care about you. I wanted to come up and give you a hug but I didn't want to freak you out. I also wanted to let you know that I think you're beautiful. Hope I get to see you again sometime and get to know you..and next time I hope you're smiling.
