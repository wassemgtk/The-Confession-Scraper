he night before finals and all through the town, Not a student was drinking and not a frat made a sound. The adderall popped and the coffee was drank; In hopes that your mind won’t go suddenly blank The guys and chicks depart from their beds, While visions of passing danced ‘round their heads. Crammed cafes and library dates, Regretting the days that you slept in late While out on the campus there struck a big nerve, Of Asian kids sprinting to mess up the curve. The readings you ignored piled up to the ceiling; Our asses are saved by Wikipedia stealing. Time home for thanksgiving was a bittersweet tease, Come back to find college screwing you on your knees. Facebook and Twitter prove a hefty temptation, Earning your citizenship in the procrasti-NATION Exams handed out, the questions complex; Pray that it’s over like a night of bad sex Eyes begin wandering while we’re crammed in our seats; That one kid is dragged out for trying to cheat Smelly dude next to me, chill bro you’re fine! Lord knows that your grade will be better than mine Hand in the exam, relieved that it’s done; It’s been real but the furthest from fun Four down, one to go, and to all that relate. HAPPY FINALS TO ALL, AND TO ALL PASSING GRADES!!
