nown you for so many years I can't even remember. The first time I saw you I was quickly attracted to you. You showed lots of care and respect to me and I was just feeling loved. Whenever I kiss your lips the smoothness of the touch makes my whole body shiver. I cannot imagine spending a night without you. You complete my life and give it purpose. I am really sorry for my past behavior though. I really couldn't manage the time to spend with you and now you are mad at me. Please remember I still love you…
… my bed.
