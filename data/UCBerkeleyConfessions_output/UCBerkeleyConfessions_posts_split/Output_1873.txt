funny how your "hero" can become the person you dislike the most. She was not a tv star or a famous person, but she is my mother. I admire this women because she raised her family by herself, and "she was always there for me. I have now realize that that is not true. I came out to her and her first words were " You are traumatize. Be careful old guys might rape or molest you." Some would say that she loves me, but I doubt it. I told her that I was molested when I was 13 by a women and that was the least of her problems. She tells me that I am not gay because I am not neat. Then I guess that I am not part of my ethnicity group because I don't take pride of it. I have watch numerous gay and straight porn and I feel nothing. There is no difference. The more porn I watch the more disgusted I become with sex. It seems humiliating, but the beauty of it is that when it is love, when you do it with the person you love, the humiliating acts are no humiliating. I have never kiss a man or girl, but I have fallen in love with a straight man. I am not clingy and I respect the boundaries, but my disgusting love has help me improve as a person. I feel that I can reach the sky and do anything. Every time my mother asks me if I am sure, she brings me down. She has a basic definition of what it means to be a man. A man is not someone who fucks every girl he sees. A man is a person who protects, is not afraid to be himself. When she told me that I was a man, I felt happy. I thought she was going to say that she was proud of me for taking this step and not ending my life or for not becoming the typical gay guy who goes into the night looking for sexual partners. She taught that a man is a person who is dirty. I spent last night in front of my laptop watching straight porn hoping to become straight and nothing! I woke up this morning and I wanted to commit suicide. I wanted to kill every person I saw because they have peace, love and confidence. Yes, maybe I am not gay, but shouldn't you be happy that this love as you call it, has increase my self-esteem. There are worse things in the world than been gay. There are straight and gay people who do incest, pedophiles, and murders. I wish I could say farewell to you, but I still love. I am sorry that I am not the little boy you wanted. I know that the best thing for me is to set my distance, but I have kids who need me in their lives. If I need to live a heterosexual to see my siblings grow, then I would do it, but don't expect me to live long. Your problems are the only inheritance that I'll keep from you. I was there when you were sick, when you had problems with my siblings, and I was there when everyone else don't their back on you. What does everything have to be about you? I need my Mother! Please solve your personal problems, so you can help your son feel good about himself once again.
