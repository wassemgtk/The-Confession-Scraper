guy with strong dominant sexual desires and because of those desires I force myself to remain constantly single.  I fantasize about physically controlling and forcing into submission women, and the idea of emotionally controlling someone turns me on.  I know that "BDSM" is a thing, but I could never enter into a relationship based off sadomasochism, because as a modern man I find sexism abhorrent and support gender equality.  If others want to consent to do those things, that's fine, but I can't accept myself dong that. Even a nonsexual relationship scares me because my dominant personality is so pervasive that I worry I would be a terrible boyfriend for whoever would be dating me.  Even in friendships or classes, I'm dominant and cow others into (in this case intellectual or conversational) submission.  I'm happy I have a strong conscience and ethical grounding but it can be tough, especially at this age, to force oneself into singlehood.  However, I'd rather be lonely and single than allow myself to jump into our permissive and abusive culture that discards women and treats them like objects (see Gray, Fifty Shades of).
