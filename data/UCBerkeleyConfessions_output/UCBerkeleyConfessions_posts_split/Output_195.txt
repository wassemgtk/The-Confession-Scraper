girl online that doesn't even go to Berkeley. We only met once at my apt., but it was the most memorable. Am I weird to say that I enjoyed our conversation more than the physical involvement from that night? I think I fell for her too hard. She was there for me when I was most vulnerable, but I messed up way too hard more than once. I don't deserve her.

Now she's gone, and I think she's with someone who can make her truly happy. If she's happy, all I can do is be happy for her too.
