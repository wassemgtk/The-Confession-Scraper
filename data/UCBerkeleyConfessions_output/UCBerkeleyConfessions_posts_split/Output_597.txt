t know how someone could have such a lack of common courtesy. Did your parents not raise you that way? Do you choose to be above it? Or are you that blind that you can't recognize you don't have it? Its ridiculous some of the things you do and not realize that there are other people it effects/ bothers. I hope you read this and realize its you I'm talking about and be a little more conscious of your actions.
