arrogant people acting like the sun shines out their ass:

It pisses me off more that anyone would assume anything about themselves because they go to a well-known school like Cal. We have a history of political activism, but that doesn't make you a political expert. Likewise, please stop assuming you're a genius because this school is known for having intelligent students. Your self-entitlement only adds to your closed-mindedness and it honestly just makes you less intelligent.
