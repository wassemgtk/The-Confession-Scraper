freshman, and was hopelessly overwhelmed by Cal -- and cripplingly shy -- during my first month or two here. That said, I've settled into the routine of things now, and I'm still getting emails from clubs I signed up for, but never actually attended. Just wondering -- in your opinion, is it too late to start showing up to events/meetings? Should I just wait for next semester/year? Or can I still try to join in?
