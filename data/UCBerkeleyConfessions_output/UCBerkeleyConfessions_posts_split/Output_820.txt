ECS majors,

Please get off your high horse and acknowledge that intelligence doesn't establish one's self worth. If you are going to measure people by their major, then you're an idiot. Once you graduate from Berkeley, find a job, start a family, and start interacting with adults...you will have a hard time fitting you if you say anyone who's not an EECS, engineering, biology, or computer science is below you. Humanity majors are not taking those classes for a grade point average boost. We take those classes simply because they spark our interest and unlike someone of you, we actually have the nerve to reach out and pursue what we LOVE, instead of conforming to society and just doing  a major because it will get us a good job. 

Sincerely,

That one pissed off political science major
