ed into the bechtel library one day and saw this cute hispanic girl sitting by herself and studying what seemed to be Chemistry. Black sweater, black glasses, long hair, and beautiful smile. Just the way she had her stuff organized on the table and was set aside from everyone, I couldn't stand but to look at her every now and then. When they were kicking us out of the library, i wanted to go up to her and say hi or ask her to go get a cup of coffee, but i don't know why i didn't. Since then, i began going to the library every tuesday at the same time, but I didn't see her around anymore. I felt my heart sink a little. Recently, I saw her walking with a group of friends towards LeConte, and as bad as this sounds, i followed them just because I didn't have any more classes and I wanted to see if I could talk to her. I noticed she had a COE pin on her black backpack and I almost went crazy. She walked into a E92 seminar, and I couldn't help but to just smile like a dumbass. She's an engineer! Now i really want to get to know herâ€¦ at the very least know her name. I hope she's not dating anyone, because she's a rare thing to find on this campus!  If someone knows her, tell her to go back to the Bechtel library on Tuesdays at 4pm ;) help a fellow engineer out.
