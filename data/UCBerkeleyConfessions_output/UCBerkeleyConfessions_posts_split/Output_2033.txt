freshman year, my roommate became obsessed with feminism and racial issues. As proud as I am of her for wanting to make a difference, i cant help but get annoyed at the fact that she has become a humor-less, frigid bitch. I really dont think our friendship can survive this, especially because she hates the fact that I'm in a sorority and she fully believes that sororities are "gangs for white people".
