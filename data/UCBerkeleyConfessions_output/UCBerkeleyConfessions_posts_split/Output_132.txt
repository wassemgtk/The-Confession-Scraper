mes I really fucking hate my room mate. he's one of the most self centered people I've ever met and he acts as if everyone's schedule and priorities just fucking revolve around him. He literally is incapable of thinking about life from other people's perspectives, and cannot give 2 shits to be considerate or listen to what people are saying. The only time he'll pay attention is if he needs something from you. Complete fucking asshole.
