cking sick and tired of all of the slutshaming that goes on at this school. So what if I've had sex with multiple guys? I shouldn't have to feel ashamed about that, but other people think I should. I'm fed up with the judgemental comments from everyone. Just because I'm very open about my sex life and have no shame in saying that I've slept with multiple people doesn't earn me the title "slut".
