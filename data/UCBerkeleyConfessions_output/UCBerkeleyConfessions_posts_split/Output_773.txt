gest fear is when my ex-boyfriend finds his next target. Although he has dated someone right after we broke up, I'm still scared every time he seems to have a new target. What I fear is being jealous of the relationship that he will be forming with someone else. Even though I know I should let go and we have been close friends since college started, it's hard to let go. Right now, I just want to be friends and be there for him. But I am scared of the day when he starts chasing after someone else, because I know it would devastate me. Honestly, the reason why it has been so hard to move on is because I do care about him and I do love him. It's hard for me to find someone else when I don't want a rebound.
