isn't a lot of people who can make me feel shame or embarrassment
But this girl I have a crush on seems to want to make me feel shame and embarrassed, maybe just because she wants to see what it takes to get me there?
Well then, fuck you, I'm not going to date someone who makes me feel bad about myself
