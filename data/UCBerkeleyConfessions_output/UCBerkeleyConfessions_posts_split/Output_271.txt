p this morning 5:30 sharp while 4 other girls slept soundly in my room. They were too drunk from the party last night and I took them home, made sure they were okay and slept on the floor. I quickly made some old fashioned ihop breakfast for them and got some of my old clothes cause there was puke on theirs. Leaving both those things and a note on the table, I quickly left as they were waking up. I took the stairs down so the elevator wouldn't have to stop on my floor and make other people late; besides, a good morning exercise is good for you. I take my old cheapy bike and head over to the RSF. Along the way I spot a homeless person and gave him the extra breakfast I made for myself and my gym clothes I was going to change out of. He needed it more than me. When I entered, the room scent didn't change at all. I try to do my usual routine lifting and try to fit it in a hour cause hey, it's pretty optimal and so I don't hog the barbell. I made a 20 lb progress on my deadlift and was pretty proud. On the way back to the locker room, I helped a guy out who was struggling with the bench. I asked to work in with him and spot him even though I didn't plan on working chest today. I didn't want him to get hurt though. We have a solid workout and exchanged numbers so he doesn't have to bench alone next time.
I looked up, and sure enough this really cute girl was coming towards me. When i say cute, I mean that girl seemed like she loved her family, studied hard, and treated everyone around her really nicely. She asked to use the machine I was on and I delightfully obliged. I walked back to the locker room and didn't ask for her number because I respect that she was just there to workout and not get hit on. As I was about to leave I see her again getting hit on by a sleazy guy and clearly uncomfortable. I proceeded to pretend to be gay and hit on the guy and making him feel queasy. She thanked me and I left before we could talk more, she thinks Im gay but no biggie. 
 I left the gym and found my bike, which I purposely don't lock, gone. Hey, if you're desperate enough to steal, go ahead. I know a friend who knows a bike shop and I get them for really cheap anyway. On the way back I see another hobo, give him a couple dollar bills and a piece of paper that directs him to the nearest homeless shelter. Now I'm sitting here, drinking filtered tap water and eating some left over breakfast the girls didn't finish. Its 12:00 and I have to head to class.
