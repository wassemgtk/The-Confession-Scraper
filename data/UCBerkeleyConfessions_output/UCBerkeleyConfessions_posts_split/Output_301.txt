r knew what it meant to "strong arm a hoe" until I came to Berkeley. After walking through overcrowded sidewalks, bustling Sproul plaza, and packed hallways, it makes sense. For a while I coped with people by turning and shifting to fit or pass by a person. However after weeks of running into inconsiderate people ( on phones, not paying attention, rude, etc.). I now stiffen my arm, tense my muscles and just strong arm a hoe.
