aking the Math 10 series and have failed (gotten 50's) on both midterms. The final is coming up and I'm SOOOOOOOOOOOO stressed out over the fact that I might be failing this class that I don't sleep at night anymore. There are no resources that I can use and practice problems really aren't enough. There isn't a textbook and youtube doesn't help me. I'm looking for some serious advice here as to waht I should do. I just want to pass this class, but I have no idea how because I'm so freaked out.
