lightly maddening seeing how often people on here like to toot their own horn about how we go to "the best public university in the world." I've seen countless posts on this page alone in which students are baffled by the ignorance and lack of knowledge among their peers. Just because our school earned an arbitrary title such as "best public university in the world," doesn't mean that everyone who got into school here is entitled to a pompous superiority complex.
