a friend who goes to UCB. well HAD a friend who is currently going to UCB. I just wanted to say, I hope you do well in life. I hate you, I really do. You put me down a lot. I have depression, I never told you because unlike you, I didn't want people to pity me or give me special attention. Only ONE person knows of my depression- my man. and he is supporting and helping me through it. But you fueled a lot of my sadness. And it hurt that the girl I called my best friend, I couldn't even tell her that. because you and the other girls were so unaccepting. I didn't feel comfortable and you never made the effort for me to be comfortable either. you always asked why I talked about dieing so casually, but when I would try to tell you the reason, you would say okay bye I gotta go. but some how you had time to talk about all YOUR problems to me. You told everyone that I was me who wasn't trying and that hurt because no matter how much annoyed I was with you, I was there. I never told you to change, but you did tell me to change and that's where I had enough. I apologize about the way it ended; there was no communication and I burned the bridges a little to quickly. But im not sorry for regretting calling you my best friend. I should have known better; best friends don't hurt each other like that. And I now know my place in your life as well. Not once did you try to talk to me after I stopped talking to you guys. But that's fine, id rather be enemies with someone than have fake friends. I need more friends like the people met in high school, who support me, believe in me and make me laugh. not make me cry. I am a strong person, but you tore me down. But that's okay, its a life experience. I am getting back up, I have battled demons like you now Im battling my inner demons. I really do hope you get to do all that you wanted; I may despise you, but I won't ask for the worst stuff to happen to you. Im not that kind of a person. good luck, and I hope your a better friend to others than you were to me. Im not saying that as an insult; I wouldn't want you to lose your friends. 

sincerely, someone who just had to say a last goodbye and why it is a goodbye and not a see you later.
