first met you, I had no idea of the incredible person I was actually meeting.  The first time I saw you, my breath was taken away at how incredibly beautiful you are.  I quickly discovered how positive and kind you were.  Each time we've hung out I enjoy spending time with you more and more.

And the more we talk, the more I discover how amazing, beautiful, smart, funny, talented, and self-driven you are.  You've completely subverted what I ever thought possible for the amount of amazing qualities that can be had by one person.  And just when I thought there couldn't possibly be any more surprises, you surprise me again.  Your laugh is contagious, your smile is perfect, and your eyes are the most beautiful I've ever seen.  

I wish I could tell you how I feel in person, but the fact is, I don't want it to be too much too soon.  I don't know if we'll ever be anything, and any guy would be the luckiest man in the world to have you.  I just hope that I get that chance some day.  Thus, I confess this to this page because it's all that I'm thinking about.  I'm supposed to be studying but I can't get you out of my head.

You'll probably read this and not think twice about it.  But if I get the chance to tell you how I feel in person, I hope that you remember this post and that I can verbally express this to you far more eloquently than what I've written here.

Until then,
Your Secret Admirer
