s my confession as a hall staff member: sometimes I hate residents. I hate that I hear complaints about having to move out at 10am even though it's that early because staff members can't go home until we check every single room in the building--and sometimes that means starting at 10am has us leaving by 5pm. That it's unfair to be written up because there was no warning even though to be given a warning is a courtesy and not a requirement. That signing in guests is all fine and dandy throughout the year, but when it's still required during move out everyone shits a brick (including the parents that think security for their kid is SUPER important). And I get upset when someone vandalizes flyers because even though it's something that is just printed on paper and could be reproduced, it took me an hour and a half to make the template because I do have standards on quality, and it took me another half hour to put up all the flyers throughout the building. I hate most of all when I hear someone talking down on one of my co-workers. You can have an opinion on your RA, PA, TPA, etc. But keep in mind that we are human beings too. So just pause for a moment before you start talking about how so-and-so is a bitch for writing you up for drinking because you probably didn't know that to NOT write you up could mean losing their job (a job that allows some of us to even be able to afford to go to Cal). #RantOver

This is my second confession as a hall staff member: in the end, I am truly thankful to work with residents and hall staff across the system. I have made so many friends and unique experiences that I know I wouldn't have been able to get in any other job. As many WTF type stories I have about residents, I also have stories about how residents have impacted me. That note you left on my door? I put it up near my desk so I can remember that some of my actions do matter. That surprise birthday party for someone on the floor that you invited me to? I was grateful to be included. Every time you tell me thank you, I glow inside because it means you care too.  I have grown as a person, met my best friends, and bonded with others despite diversity/challenges because I am a staff member and because you as a resident have allowed me to be a part of your Cal experience. I may bitch and moan, but I wouldn't continue with this job if I didn't think it was all worth it in the end.
