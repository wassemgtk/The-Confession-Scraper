people who dont have anything to wear except Cal gear shit. 
I swear to god we know you go to Cal and if you did not notice, everyone here goes to Cal too! You dont have to wear a Cal shirt, hoodie, pants, socks, and underwear to prove that you go to Berkeley. 
I just dont know how you lived before getting into here. Were you just naked for all your life until you got your acceptance letter, and just went straight to Cal store and did all your shopping!!!
