ut to the guy who just walked out of Whole Foods and gave a homeless man a loaf of bread, cheese, strawberries and blueberries when the homeless man only asked for a quarter. You didn't go back in to buy more afterward either. You just genuinely preferred the homeless man enjoy the food you bought rather than yourself. The world needs more people like you
