ied to lose my virginity to the Indian guy I met at the DC and the next time I see him, he introduces me to his cousin who promptly asks for my number. It was so obvious that he seemed to think I was a "typical American girl" or so I heard from his friends. Humiliating. Never trusting a guy with a foreign accent again. Fuck that prick!
