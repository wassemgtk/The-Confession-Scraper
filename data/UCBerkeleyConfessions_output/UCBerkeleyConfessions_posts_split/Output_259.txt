with a guy who's basically my favorite person. He makes me laugh, I make him laugh, we like the same shit, etc. I can't stop thinking about him. 
Problem is, he's got a girlfriend, a long distance one, and apparently they're pretty serious. (for the record, and I swear I'm not a cocky person, but I am def cuter)
Is it even worth telling him? Or should I keep that shit to myself? Every time I get drunk around him I worry I'm gonna let it slip
