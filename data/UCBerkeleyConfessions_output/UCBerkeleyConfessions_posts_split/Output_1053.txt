ly don't like it when Middle Eastern and South Asian people refer to themselves as brown. Brown people = people in/from Latin America. You guys are technically in Asia so I don't know why you won't refer to yourself as yellow. Call yourself Orange or something, that's not taken. Seriously though, you're not brown. Be original.

It's rough enough being Latin at Cal as everyone assumes I am of the bleeding heart, self segregating variety. I don't need to be confused with Middle Eastern or South Asian individuals as well. It's better than the former, but I don't want to disappoint anyone who may expect me to cook some bomb ass Indian food or seduce them in the beautifully mysterious parseltongue that is Arabic.
