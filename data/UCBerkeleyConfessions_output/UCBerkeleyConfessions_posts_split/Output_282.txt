.E.

I saw you at crossroads last year. You had just rolled your ankle and you were on crutches. When you walked through the door, I thought I might offer to help you carry your food to where you were sitting to be nice, but I decided against it initially, thinking it would be weird. After about 10 minutes, I went to go get another plate of food, only to see you waiting by the sandwich area with a plate. I then went over to you and helped you to your seat. We talked for awhile and I built up enough courage and asked for your number and you gave it to me. I tried texting you a couple of times, and you never responded :(

Moral of the story: girls like you are the reason nice guys have no confidence
