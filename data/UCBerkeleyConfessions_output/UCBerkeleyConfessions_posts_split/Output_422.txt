t comprehend how some people who claim to be "liberal" and "open-minded" are actually the most narrow-minded people I've met. It's so frustrating to talk to them about a completely intellectual topic and end up having them storm out of the room throwing personal attacks at you and claiming you just "don't understand." I am clearly trying to understand your opinion and am only pointing out the holes I see in your argument. You immediately shun my thoughts because they are not conducive with yours and that in itself is frustrating beyond belief. Grow up already because not everyone is going to agree with you. Accept the difference in opinion we share and stop acting like I'm always in the wrong just because I disagree. That's all I'm asking.
