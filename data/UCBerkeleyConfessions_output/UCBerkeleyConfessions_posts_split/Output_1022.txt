s not a confession, but a humble request to all those out there in UC Berkeley Confessions Land...

My little sister and I started a t-shirt line that is very near and dear to our hearts because it is named after our mom who passed away a year and a half ago from ovarian cancer. We created this t-shirt line so that we can keep her legacy alive, but also to help us contribUte to my mom's non-profit organization AISCS (aiscs.org) . Which works to empower women, bring water and education to children in rural Tanzania.

Our clothing line is called "akelo." and you can check us out on facebook at: www.facebook.com/akelolifestyleco to learn more about us.

The reason I am posting is because we have t-shirts, but we want people like you to model them for us. We want to have a photo session in Berkeley on Saturday Nov. 9th, so if any of you are interested in volunteering your time, that would be amazing! Of course we can only have people 18 and over unless they have their parents with them and we will ask everyone to sign a photo waiver. We can't really afford to pay anyone, but we will be happy to email you a copy of the picture we take of you and if you want to buy a t-shirt, that would be AMAZING! We are not professional photographers at all, so no pressure.

Please message us on our facebook page if you're interested. :)

Thanks!

Pamela and Sarah.
