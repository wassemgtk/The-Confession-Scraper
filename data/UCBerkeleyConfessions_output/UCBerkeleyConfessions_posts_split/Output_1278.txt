girl who's sad because the guy you have a crush on was kissing another girl on Halloween: I think that guy was me. I'm really sorry, it felt like you were kinda blowing me off and not talking to me, so I went to talk to some other people, one of whom was the "other bitch" who started coming on to me. I wish I'd had the courage to tell her to stop, but I didn't, and I really regret it. I like you too, so please give me another chance. I promise I'm a better guy than what I showed that night.
