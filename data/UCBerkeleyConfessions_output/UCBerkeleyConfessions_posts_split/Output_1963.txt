graduating senior. I'm still just as sexist, racist, and misogynistic as I was on my first day back in freshman year; the only difference is that I now know how to better defend my positions thanks to the education I received here at Cal. I am so glad that my viewpoints were often challenged here because that opposition helped me strengthen my arguments which only reinforced my positions and hearing from the other side helped highlight the logical fallacies in their arguments. Because I am educated, I am open to changing my views if presented with compelling evidence to the contrary, but none of the ethnic studies or women's studies courses I took here provided such evidence. Thank you Berkeley for the wonderful education I received! I will have fun in the real world now (':
