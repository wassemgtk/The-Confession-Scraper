elitist, obnoxious ass who posted that EECS majors take humanities for grade boosters:

Talk to me after you've taken English 45A (Canterbury Tales, anyone?), not to mention all the English upper-div's and reading-intensive courses Cal has to offer.

It's not about anyone having a HARDER MAJOR. For EECS, coding classes are proly easier for you. It depends on the person and we need to stop all this "easy major, hard major" bullshit.
