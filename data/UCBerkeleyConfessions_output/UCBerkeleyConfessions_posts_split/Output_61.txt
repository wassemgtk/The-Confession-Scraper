females I find attractive and friendly depresses me with a tinge of fear too.  It doesn't make sense to me.  The attractive part is understandable, but somehow the friendly part makes me feel cheated.  Like I wanted to think they were all vicious creatures.  But that's false.  So it's not intimidation. 

I force myself to get up at 5 am everyday and jog/cycle outside so I can avoid them. And lift in my room--the RSF is absolutely the worst place for me.  Too many doing cardio.  I sometimes start walking to campus for lecture, but then after noticing a pretty, smiling girl, I turn around and slink back to my room inexplicably demotivated.  I often get to-go boxes from Xroads and get back as fast as possible or sit in front of windows.  In my room I can finally raise my head and look straight ahead without fear (unless it's buried in a textbook).  In fact this RRR week is the best because they're likely studying and not in my view.

I wish I were comfortable/not insta-sad in their presence.
