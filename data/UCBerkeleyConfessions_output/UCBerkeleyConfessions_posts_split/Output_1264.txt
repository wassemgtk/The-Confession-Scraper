ow I get really annoyed when guys get defensive about their dick size or say they feel so degraded because their worth is determined by the size of their meat. I have no fucking sympathy for you at all. You know why? I've felt inadequate in a million ways whenever overhearing that myself or some girl is " not pretty/hot/sexy" enough or when guys start comparing their girlfriends or fuck buddies with each other. Then let's not forget the million times girls get hit on in the streets by leering men, or guys going up to a girl telling then damn your ass is nice! Or some shit like that.

I feel with all the shit girls go through with their looks, I'm entitled to make you feel like shit for your small dick. That's just the tip (no pun intended) of the iceberg for the pain girls have to go through on a daily basis.
