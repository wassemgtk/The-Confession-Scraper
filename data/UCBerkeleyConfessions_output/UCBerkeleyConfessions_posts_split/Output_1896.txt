transfer student who, so far, is not at all impressed with Cal's social scene. The parties disgust me and remind me of high school-- I mean... really? I left high school for a reason. I expected free spirits and eccentric individuals... this is the home of the free speech movement after all.  Instead, it seems that students are too immersed in the pathetic greek life (aka women objectifying themselves and men desperately trying to get their dick wet) to grow up and experience a real social life. Please please prove me wrong Berkeley...
