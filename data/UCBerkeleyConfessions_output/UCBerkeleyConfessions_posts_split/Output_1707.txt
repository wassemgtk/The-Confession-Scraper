ly hate the Indian community at Cal sometimes. Yes I'm talking about 2520 and Indus. It's cool and all to be with a bunch of people my own race but I feel like we scrutinize each other way too much. I feel like I'm always being judged when I hang out in groups especially by girls who gossip the shit out of any awkward conversations or encounters. We're human, it fucking happens. It's literally gotten to the point where people can't even have fun anymore unless they are drunk out of their minds. Seriously, you guys are gonna pre-game the fucking garba? Yeah I know I'm also being a little judgemental here but it's a little pathetic to pregame to an event that has religious undertones. Seriously you guys are so self-destructive you don't even know.
