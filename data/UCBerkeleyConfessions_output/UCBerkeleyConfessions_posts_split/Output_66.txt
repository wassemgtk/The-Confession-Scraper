Stern girl dating a Bowles boy. He even lost his virginity to me but the only problem is: he doesn't know my real age. I'm 27. He is 20. I transferred here from community college and i didn't want to find an apt so I decided to just live in the residence halls since I can I pass for 22. He thinks we are close in age but we really are 7 years apart. I lied to him because I didn't think our relationship would be anything more than a fling but now he's told me he loves me. I feel scared that he will find out my age on the internet by doing a name search. I feel like I want to get out of the relationship because our age difference but my feelings for him prevent me from saying goodbye although I constantly threaten him that we will have to part.
