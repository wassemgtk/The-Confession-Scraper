friends, we have a lot in common. But you honestly treat me like shit. If you don't like me just say it, otherwise you need to be more careful of how you act around someone who's your friend. Sooner or later people will get tired of your bipolar attitude. You're not a good friend and im not sure if it's intentional or not. Grow the fuck up please and thank you.
