do you know that one of my favorite days was when we spent the evening at the art and film museum when they gave out free posters and free pizza... We laid in the room with the dramatic film montage going on all four walls, staring at the ceiling and talking until they kicked us out. And while watching that film on my blanket, you kept moving closer... 
Ever since that night, I've fallen so hard for you that it's going to be difficult to pick myself back up. You broke it off and said you aren't ready for a relationship... Meanwhile all I want is you. I want you to play with my hands, my hair. I want to be able to sit closer and closer. The tender kisses while waiting for the night shuttle; secretly holding hands under the blanket when you think our friends might be looking; the way you run your fingers across my cheek... I miss it all. And now you say you want to be just friends... How can I be just friends when I can't stop thinking about your lips on mine, and how it used to be between us?...
