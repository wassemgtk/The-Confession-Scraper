ender and Womyn's Studies major, I find proof of patriarchy every day when MEN tell me that my major is easier than theirs and how the form of feminism I preach is outdated!! So what if there are more womyn in college than men now? So what if womyn outperform men in many areas academically in K-12 now? So what if more womyn go to medical and law school now and have broken through other glass ceilings professionally?? NONE of it matters so long as we remain to be a MALE driven society!! It has actually been proven that science classes and math classes are HARDER for womyn to succeed in because they are designed for those who have a penis! No joke! Why do you think that it's so easy to make misogynistic math jokes about "lying tangent to a womyn's curves" or telling me "I donâ€™t like my current girlfriend. Mind if I do a you-substitution?" . This is why we need SEPARATE math classes for womyn so that we can feel safe from all those predatory math and science major males who can probably calculate in their heads just how much alcohol it would take to rape us. It's no wonder that rape culture is so prevalent in the MALE driven academia and in the MALE driven media! I know that many of you, especially MEN, will not take this post seriously, and that fact alone is PROOF of just how strong patriarchy is in this country because you are disregarding what I say just because I am a strong, independent womyn!!
