into the lounge downstairs in my building to play piano for a while.  When I walked in the room I noticed the couch was turned around and there was a blanket moving around on the other side of it.  There were some noises and whispering coming from under the blanket.  It did not take me long to realize that there was some passionate sexual activity going on under that blanket.  I hesitated for a moment then turned around to leave. I then changed my mind and headed for the piano.  I hope my romantic love songs and passionate singing was appreciated. Your Welcome
