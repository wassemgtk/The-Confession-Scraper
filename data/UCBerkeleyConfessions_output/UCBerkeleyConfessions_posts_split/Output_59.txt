brunette in Alpha Phi that I brought back to my apartment last weekend:

I was blacked out only knew I brought you home because my house-mate saw you on your way out in the morning. I found 2 condoms a couple feet from my trashcan when I finally managed to shake of that raging headache and get out of bed. I also found almost all of the lube in my dresser drawer on my sheets and surrounding the bottle on my floor. I literally have no idea what happened, but I thought your name was Laura or Lauren or something like that. I think I got your number, but since I don't know your name, looking though my contacts list doesn't help much. 

I you remember who I am, and you somehow happen to still have my number, you should hit me up. As fun as it is to not remember a night of nailing a hot sorority girl in my apartment, next time (if there is a next time) I hope we can do it pre-alcohol poisoning? I think some people here would call that rape, but I won't judge you that harshly. With the amount of lube missing from my bottle, I can only hope that we did anal, or at least something crazy. 

Let me know if we can make this work again.

Also, I VERY SLIGHTLY remember you saying something about a boyfriend to me last night. If you are currently in a relationship, I'd call you a pretty fucked up person. But I guess as the old saying goes, if someone's already got dibs on the pussy, just fuck the ass.

Talk / see you soon?
