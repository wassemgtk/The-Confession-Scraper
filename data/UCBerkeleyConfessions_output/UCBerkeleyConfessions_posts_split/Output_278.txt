% sure that my friend is bulimic but I'm not sure how to go about helping her. She's really good at it. I only noticed because my roommate pointed out how she would always go to the bathroom an hour after she ate and stay in there for 10-15 minutes. My roommate also told me that she heard my friend making gagging noises in the bathroom a couple times which made me listen carefully the next time she was at my place. I heard the noises, too. But with how skinny she's able to stay, I'm actually not sure whether I want to help her or ask her for tips on how to start.
