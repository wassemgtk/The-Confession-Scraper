the people who arrive to class early and then save 2 or 3 extra seats for your "friends" coming later, FUCK YOU. When you come early, YOU and YOU ONLY are entitled to open seats, NOT YOUR SHITTY FUCKING FRIENDS. I don't care if your backpack is there, YOUR FRIEND IS NOT THERE, AND I WILL TAKE THAT SEAT unless your friend can morph into a backpack at will.

I came to class at 2:01 and this girl is saving three seats in the front row for her friends who just talk during class when the professor is talking. Once again, GO FUCK YOURSELF.

Sincerely,
A real student
