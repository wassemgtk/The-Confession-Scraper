es everyone in Berkeley drive so badly?

I was simultaneously blotting the oils off of my Prada moisturized chin and merging my freshly delivered SL65 AMG onto Martin Luther King from the freeway, when from nowhere this dirty filth of a human being in a Honda Civic tries to race with me!

I gasped from air as my Dior covered eyes squinted with anguish. This dirty trash gave me the finger through his unwashed Honda windows. Mr. Walmart began to flash his halogen lights at me (mind you, one of the lamps was out----illegal!!!) and when I thought the shine was magnified through my D&G eyeglasses, I didn't suffer since my auto-dimming rear view mirrors kicked in. 

I was having so much fun as I couldn't get rid of the smirk on my Chanel red lips. I stomped on the AMG pedal with my Louboutin's to activate the V12 Biturbo's massive horsepower as I could see through my D&G the trash was gone in the wind.

I wasn't done with him yet. I slowed down to 40 mph as I approached campus waiting for him to glimpse my red exclusive Nappa leather shining through his worthless eyes. Oops! As I saw him approach, I quickly followed him but accidentally hit my windshield wipers as my YSL manicured hands accidentally slipped. 

Then some fat cop in a smelly uniform pulled me over. With a disapproving look on my face, I was quick to ask him what he wanted: Money?? Tickets to the next London fashion week? My Hermes bag to prance around in? He rolled his Neutrogena moisturized (but disgustingly wrinkled, un-Botoxed) eyes at me, but before he had a chance to write me a ticket, I began to tell him what hell I was enduring! I've been to court before and every time I go, my white Gucci pants always get stained by those ugly wooden benches. He went back to his car to write a ticket.

Meanwhile, I looked at my vintage Breitling Rescue Watch and noticed that 5 minutes has passed! I was going to be late for my Dior fitting that evening!!
