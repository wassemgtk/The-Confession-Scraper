mmate is always in our room. She's there so damn often that it's making me uncomfortable to go in sometimes. Every time I come home from school or work she's there. What's worse is she's sleeping literally all the time, and I don't want to turn on the light and wake her up without seeming rude. She really needs to find some freaking things to do.
