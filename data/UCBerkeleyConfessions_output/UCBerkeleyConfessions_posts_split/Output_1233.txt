roommate who is always asking where I am. Stop fucking asking me where I go. I came to Berkeley to get away from my parents, not to get one. Stop asking me what time i slept, what time i woke up, where i am going, when i am coming back. I have my own life and you have your own. I dont ask you anything cause I simply dont care and you shouldn't  either. Also, open the windows and curtain sometimes. Your not a fucking vampire. The room gets stuffy and hot, and i hate that. That is all.
