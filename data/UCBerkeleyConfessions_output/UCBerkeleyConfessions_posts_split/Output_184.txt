bing Tian, I see you around campus all the time, but I'm too afraid to approach you. You're just so unimaginably beautiful that I choke just before I summon the courage to talk to you. I just wish I knew from you that you'd be open to the idea of a random guy asking you out to dinner, and maybe more ;)
