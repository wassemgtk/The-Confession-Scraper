t going to be afraid of offending you women anymore. This school and society have pounded it into my head that it's bad to hit on or attempt to flirt with women because it comes off as creepy, sexist, or possibly rapist like. I'M NOT A RAPIST I'M JUST REALLY TURNED ON BY YOUR ASS IN YOGA PANTS. TAKE IT AS A COMPLIMENT! 

I will remain respectful, but I will not hesitate to go up to someone and tell them I find them attractive and would like to find out who they are. Simple as that.
