een here for two and a half months already and I thought fitting in would be a breeze (I'm an international student, the English-is-my-first-language kind); though the few people I've met are cool, the relationships are pretty superficial and I don't often get a chance to hang out with them. The people I call my 'closest' friends are getting increasingly wearying to hang out with and don't like going out to do anything. I feel like I'm being lumped together with a specific crowd because of some of my interests, while people mistake my shyness for being antisocial. I don't really have anyone to do fun stuff with, and it's making me unmotivated and homesick.
It sounds ironic, but at a school that emphasises individuality and forming your own identity, I just want to belong.
