mmate wants to get down on a Latino girl in our building, but he's afraid the people on my floor are going to make fun of him afterwards. It's really frustrating for him because he has such a deep love for someone and is forced to hide it because of society. The girl is also interested, they made out once but were both forced to deny it and pretend they didn't like it so they would 'fit in'. 

What should I do to tell him that he should be himself no matter what? It's just so hard when people try to be someone they're not just to fit into the mould of society. Help them be happy together, please! Don't judge just on behalf of looks :(
