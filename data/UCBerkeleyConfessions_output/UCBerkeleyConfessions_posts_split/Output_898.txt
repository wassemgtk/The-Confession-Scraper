e first met I just knew we had something special that now haunts me. When I see you or even talk to you, I get so nervous but you instantly make my day so much better. When I don't, I only wish you walk by or I just happen to bump into you. You drive me crazy. I have been thinking about you every single day since we met, and it's because my heart beats every day. I don't know if I'm good enough for you, or even your type. Last time I talked to you, I mentioned taking chances. Iâ€™m ready. Hopefully you are too. Expect me to swing on by soon :)
