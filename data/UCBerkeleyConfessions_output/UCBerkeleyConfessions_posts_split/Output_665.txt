picked on throughout elementary and middle school by the same group of girls for very BS but stereotypical reasons- being nerdy, awkward, funny looking, etc. And over the years, I've heard about how these girls are doing through Facebook or just word of mouth. Here I am studying at the best school in the world (GO BEARS!) and enjoying all these opportunities, while back at home they're being rejected by everything,dropping out, working dead end jobs, getting married, having babies, etc at my age... Now, I know it doesn't even really matter, and I'm not a hateful or revengeful person. But man, feels good to know that karma really is only a bitch if you are! :)
