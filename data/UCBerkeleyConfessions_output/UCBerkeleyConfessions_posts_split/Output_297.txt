it annoying when people refer to Berkeley as the "top public university in the world" and say that coming here was the best decision they ever made.  Honestly, if you went anywhere else, you would think the exact same thing.  It's as illogical as patriotism; just because you happen to be at a certain place doesn't make it the best thing ever.  Thinking otherwise just means you need an excuse to feel better about yourself and where you are.
