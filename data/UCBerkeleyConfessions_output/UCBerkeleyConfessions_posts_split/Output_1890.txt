a theory about Breaking Bad. Instead of Walter White doing the cooking, it was really Walter White jr. and his companion Brock doing the cooking, ya hear me? Since jr. fucking loves his cereal due to his cereal palsy, he took up cooking meth to fuel his need. Along the way, he met Brock, who also loves himself some good ass breakfast. Together they created the greatest Meth empire ever. They dealt their Meth within Fruit Loops and Apple Jacks cereal boxes to get kids hooked on it. They only dealt during breakfast times to ensure the meth kept it's cereal like qualities. Hell even when Jr. cooks, he would change the purity of the meth to change the colors so it would look more like cereal. It all makes sense now. Yeah. And when anybody would cross Jr., he fucking killed them by forcing them to eat so much cereal they exploded. Walter White didn't kill Gus, if you look closely, there is a cereal box in Gus's room as Walter leaves, implying it was Jr. who actually did the crime. I know this because I took a film class at Berkeley. Jr. even told some guy to fuck off by saying "St-st-stay outa myyyyy territory....Biiitch!" I thinking of doing a decal on this. Should I?
