ut nearly every weekend. I drink, I dance, I have fun with friends. But I've never hooked up with anyone. It's not that I'm ugly or introverted or anything - it's just not me. But sometimes I come back wishing it was. I wonder why I put so much importance on moral rectitude and shit. Like this is college, does it really matter if I go out and do stupid shit every once in a while? I "know" that I'm not the type of person to hook up with strangers and all, but still, just a thought...
