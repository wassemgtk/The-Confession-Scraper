s up with this whole race thing! seriously if they say "you're a very pretty (insert race) person" just take the friggin' compliment don't over analyze it. maybe they don't intend to mention your race it just comes out. 
anyways....how is everyone's summer thus far?
i'm here chillin' with the fam in puerto rico sipping some tequila in the hot ass beach...
