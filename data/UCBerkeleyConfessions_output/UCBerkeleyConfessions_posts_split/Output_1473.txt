such a crush on my GSI, but I can't tell if he likes me or not. I've gone in to 1-on-1 office hours before and we've stayed way over our time just talking about our common interests. He emails me interesting articles that are unrelated to the class. SO CONFUSED. he is just so cool. I made him smile for the first time today and he was so cute when he did that in my head i was like "i wanna marry you and have your genius babies"
