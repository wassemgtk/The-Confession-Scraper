ets me to see posts about people looking to give up their pets (or even worse, trying to sell them) on the Free & For Sale page. Companion animals are for life, not for when it's convenient to have them. It's ridiculous to me to see that some people are giving up their pets because their new roommate is allergic, etc (because, well, they had the animal before they got the roommate!) And not only that, it is irresponsible to try and find them a home with other college students (who may be out-of-state or international), since the animal mind up in the same situation again. What enrages me even more is when people try to SELL their animals. How could they live with themselves trying to profit off of a life? It is also irresponsible and wrong for them to breed their animals, since there are so many animals that are euthanized in shelters each year due to lack of space and lack of people willing to take them in. 

Yes, I understand that people are trying to re-home the animals themselves before bringing them to a shelter, but I think they should have considered the entire life of the animal before bringing them into their home. Also, there are some shelters that do not euthanize their animals. 

I hope people will start considering whether or not they can provide a lifetime of love and care for an animal before bringing them into their home.
