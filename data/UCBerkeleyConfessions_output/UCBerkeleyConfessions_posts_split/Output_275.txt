s a note to the squirrels of Berkeley: I was walking with a friend to class and saw a little squirrel and gasped in glee, and told my friend to look at it. "Look, a cute little baby squirrel!" I shouted. His response was, "That's not a baby squirrel. That's a fully grown squirrel. It's just normal sized." 

Take this to heart squirrels of Berkeley. I literally thought that a perfectly average sized squirrel was an infant because you are so fucking fat. Get the FUCK off the couch, stop stuffing your face with student's leftovers, and find a treadmill you fat fucks. you're embarrassing yourselves. No hot USC squirrels are gunna wanna fuck you when you are all morbidly obese.
