an eating disorder. I cannot eat properly, people are constantly telling me I'm fat so I've tried dieting over the years but now I've formed this problem where I don't even eat food normally.. Like I literally only eat one or two small things a day and I don't know how to get better. When I eat regularly I feel guilty and end up depressed but when I don't eat I feel like death. I need help. It's not even that I'm that fat, society has conditioned our minds that skinny=beautiful and although I know that's wrong I can't undo so many decades of brainwash. If only I had confidence I wouldn't worry about appearances
