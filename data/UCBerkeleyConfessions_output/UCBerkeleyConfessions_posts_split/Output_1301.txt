guy I met while dancing. I just wanted to say thank you for being so nice and fun in general. You didn't ignore your friend (even though he was drunken mess) and your dancing was so fun/funny. You didn't make me feel creeped out like other guys. I laughed and smiled a lot because of you. When you kissed me, it wasn't gross or sloppy, in fact you didn't even try to stick your tongue in my mouth at all; they were cute little pecks that crept up my neck to my ears.

I'm sorry I didn't bother to get your number nor give you mine. It didn't even come to mind when I left. You were the best fun at a party I've had in a long time. The next girl you're with is going to have a good time because you were a great guy.
