liked my friend ever since I first laid eyes on him years ago. I've always thought that he might like me back but I've always been afraid to tell him how I feel because I do not want our friendship to end. 
In a couple of weeks we will be going out together, but I do not know if i should consider it a date or just a friendly day to hang out. Every time that we are around one another we flirt, we hug, we stare at each other, and everything just feels right and I want to believe that he likes me but to be honest I am not quite sure, and at this point I would like to do anything to know if I stand a chance to be with him or if I should just move on. 
So when we go out in a couple weeks I want to tell him that I like him but I need some ideas on how to tell him. I don't want to freak him out (even though i am sure he knows how I feel)  I just want to know how he feels about me so I can have peace of mind. HELP!
