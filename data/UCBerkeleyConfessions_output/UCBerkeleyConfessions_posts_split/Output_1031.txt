airos people, stop stalking me and stop trying to force me to join your group. yes i am a christian but i don't believe i need to go to church to retain my morals and beliefs. your methods are just scary and a little over the top. having two of you show up unexpectedly in my room (my roommate is in kairos, although he's a lot nicer about me not being in it), and pretending to just ask how i'm doing before pivoting the conversation back to kairos--ugh. it's CREEPING ME OUT.
