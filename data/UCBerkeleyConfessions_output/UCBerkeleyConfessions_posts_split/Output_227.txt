e developed a crush on this cute indian guy in my econ section. He never introduced himself properly but I think his name is Oncore (sp?) or something based on roll call. The thing is, I try really hard to make it obvious that I'm flirting with him by smiling and looking into his eyes a lot but he still hasn't asked for my number or anything. I don't know if he's just shy or if he's not interested. Any ladies out there gone through the same thing and ended up with the guy?
