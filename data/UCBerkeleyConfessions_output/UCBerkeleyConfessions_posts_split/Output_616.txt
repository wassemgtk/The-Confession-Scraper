nnoying pre-med pledge freshman class occupying unit 1 study space (you know who you are),

1. There are like 10,000 of you occupying one study lounge. For the residents in this building it is extremely inconvenient. Our study rooms are not open to the public and you are always there. You may study for two hours a day, NOT THE WHOLE FUCKING THREE DAY WEEKEND (pretty sure I saw one of you sleeping in there). I'm sure you have other places to study/ people to annoy.

2. Please do not leave your trash on our study room tables!! It is very disrespectful, ESPECIALLY IF YOU DO NOT LIVE IN SAID BUILDING. Residents have had to clean up after you dirty people!!! As guests, you should have more respect for our space. I am assuming you are at least 18+ years of age, therefore you are an adult, and ALSO you go to Cal so I'm assuming you have a certain level of intellectual capacity. PICK UP AFTER YOURSELVES. YOU'RE SO ANNOYING.
Besides, how are you gonna be a surgeon if you're so fucking dirty?? You're gonna infect your patients and give them all sorts of diseases. Gross.

HAVE SOME RESPECT.
