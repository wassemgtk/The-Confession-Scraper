e for this school is unconditional. I grew up in a Latino/Hispanic community, and being introduced to such diversity has really opened my mind. I've learned to interact with so many people of different backgrounds and I can honestly say it's one of the most interesting experiences I have ever came across in my life.Point is, I'm loving this school and the people in it. This University was my first choice since 9th grade, and I can assure that I will give it my 110% to make my school and family proud, as a MCB/Pre-med major, but most importantly, as a BEAR! We Latinos/Hispanics are one of the most humble and generous races. We work really hard to gain respect from everyone. Trust me, I've been to work with my dad(he does flooring), and I don't know how he can handle it.Waking up at 4 a.m. every day, being on your knees the whole time and lifting heavy roles of carpet and heavy boxes of tiles is truly a b@#$%. But what sucks even more is the salary he's receiving that isn't worth doing the labor work for. But he still does it. To provide for his family. And this goes to many other races as well that face different struggles, but don't gain the respect they deserve. That includes asians, caucasians, african/african americans, native americans, etc. Well have a great evening everyone. Do your best in all your classes. I know it can be really tough at some points, but just keep in thought that its freaking hard but not impossible. Much love to all my fellow BEARS.

Sincerely, 
The mysterious Mexican American guy. lol.

P.S. All is well.
