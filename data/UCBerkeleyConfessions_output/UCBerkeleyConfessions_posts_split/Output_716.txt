honest, ever since I came here to Cal, I've been feeling like a loser. I'm going to graduate next semester, but I feel I have let my family down. I am asian (indian) majoring in MCB, but my grades are total bullshit. I work hard, I go to office hours, I study, I try and understand the material, but I always fuck up and get average, below average grades. My gpa is slightly below 3.0, and I think I'm even going to fail a class this semester since I'm just burned out at this point. I feel like a fucking loser. I don't even belong here. All my friends are applying to medical school and are apparently hearing back with acceptances, and here I am, with a shitty GPA and an even worse major that has no job prospects unless you go to med school or get a PhD. My parents are probably disappointed in me. I haven't had any fun at all during my time here. Never went to a party, never had a girlfriend. All I did was try and study this bullshit material, just to get shitty grades. whereas all my friends were partying and getting great grades and are now going to enter med schools. I'm actually really really jealous...but I guess I am just a stupid person. You know, I actually liked biology, and this is why I stuck with it, but now I realize that was a horrible decision. I'm a failure, and I don't know what to do with my life anymore. Whatever, I just needed to get this out there....
