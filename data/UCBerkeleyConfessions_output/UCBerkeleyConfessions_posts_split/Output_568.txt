me or do people at Berkeley NOT know how to walk properly? Not saying there's a right way to walk, but people are just going all over, swerving, nearly bumping into cars, or texting on the dang phone when they shouldn't be. I mean, it's none of my business but when I'm balancing my lab notebooks and a quick dinner from GBC, I don't want to be interrupted by some person who couldn't bear to look away from their phone screen for 2 minutes. Sproul is the worst.
