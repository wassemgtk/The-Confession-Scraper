d to hit on this guy today at Starbucks and it was just embarrassing. It was my first time so it was just awful. He could totally see that I was trying desperately to not fuck up anymore so than I already was. He says, "Okay okay stop, I feel bad just seeing you wreck this train but it was cute. I'm sorry to say I'm actually seeing someone but since you tried so hard let me buy you a drink." So he buys me a drink in addition to my rejection and gives me hints to how I can flirt better. 

You know who you are and I wanted to say thank you for not traumatizing my entire dating scene!!!!!!!!!
