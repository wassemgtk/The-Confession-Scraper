ght I loved all of my roommates, but I was wrong. I've learned not to stand too close to one in particular because this person usually smells like they just left the gym. This person is extremely messy, inconsiderate, eats loudly and chews with their mouth open, and also picks and eats their boogers. . . even in front of company. I'm trying not to snap. I'm haven't and won't say anything to this person because I think it will hurt their feelings. I hope my suffering in silence is getting me some brownie points in Heaven or something.
