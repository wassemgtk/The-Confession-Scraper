of girls thinking that the world is out to get them here... so fucking annoying. one thing just of the top of my head that girls have better than guys at university is grade changing. firstly I would say that this was mainly a female phenomenon. Guys, you've never inquired about changing a grade, even if you think the grade is fair? unsurprising! but girls do it ALL the time. If they don't get a grade they like, they run to the professor and demand that it be changed. 

If a girl asks for a grade change: "Suuuuure, why not, here Ill bump your C+ to a B, or your B to an A-, seem fair, i guess if you're complaining you must have some ground to go on"

If a guy asks for a grade change: "Too bad, you have a syllabus you know what was expected, I can't help you, that would be unfair on everyone else! can't help you buddy!"

so annoying and so UNFAIR!
