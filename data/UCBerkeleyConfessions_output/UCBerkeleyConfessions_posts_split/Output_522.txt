I always push guys away. Like if I see that they are interested in me I become a total bitch to them and they stop being interested. Or if I'm interested in a guy I'll act like I'm not interested and they don't even bother spending the time or effort on me. I'm always complaining about wanting a bf and how lonely I am and I always asks myself why no one likes me but honestly I put myself in this situation.
