being unsure of how someone feels about me. Usually i'm pretty good at knowing when someone likes me, but i just don't get this guy. he acts like he likes me on some days, and then on other days, he completely ignores me. it is to the point where i am starting to think that i mistook his constant glances and nervous smiles to mean more than they did. i wish i just knew what the heck he thinks and wants. i'm getting frustrated, partly because i think i like him now, and partly because i've never had a problem like this before

ugh
