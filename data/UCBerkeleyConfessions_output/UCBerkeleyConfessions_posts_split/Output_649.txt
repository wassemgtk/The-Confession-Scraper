ed up with you in early September. I should have known you weren't that type of person but I went for it anyways. It's so unfortunate because we actually had so much in common, and there was something warm and genuine about you that always kept you on my mind afterwards. We could have happened, but we started on the wrong foot and now we never talk. So if you see this, I'm sorry things went downhill. I'm not great at building relationships but I swear I tried. I wish we could talk again; you might find that I'm not the person you made me out to be.
