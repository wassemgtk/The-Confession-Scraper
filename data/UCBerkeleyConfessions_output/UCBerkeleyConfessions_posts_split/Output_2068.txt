you at the lambda house in oct or nov 2010... We only exchanged a few words because I got distracted and went to my friend's room. I didn't get to see you later than night but eventually ran into you at the club a few times and we've exchanged a few words then too. Once you were drunk and your friend told me you thought I was cute. I almost died *_* Young Hoon Lee, you're probably too old now to cross this page but you're cute as fuck and I'm really sad you're moving to ny in less than 2 weeks. I'm lightweight sad I never got to hang out with you but good luck out there! Keep jiral-ing on, jiral king.
