ally have a pet squirrel. One day, while eating a gigantic peanut butter and jely sandwich, I was walking home from VLSB when a squirrel began following me. I gave it part of my sandwich, and it started following me home. I put my backpack down for a second and it jumped right in without me noticing. When I got back to my dorm room, it jumped out. I was so shocked, but then I realized how lucky I am. I am the Squirrel Whisperer. I am chosen by God. I am Jesus.
