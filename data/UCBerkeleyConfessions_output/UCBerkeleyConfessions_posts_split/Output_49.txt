to Fall 2013: 

A semester at Berkeley 
It's been quite a ride
But finals are here
And there's nowhere to hide

The time now has come
To reflect on the year
On essays, and asians
And truckloads of beer 

Gettin frisky at the Coops 
Blacking out at SAE 
Trying coke for the first time
Cause how bad could it be?

Gameday turnup 9 am
Lookin for conquest 
Drunken hookup with a 9
But a sober 4 at best  

Dinner at Asian ghetto
Hobos on the prowl 
Thank Jesus for Berkeley time 
But fuck flyers on Sproul

Vitali flows like waterfalls
Cheep beer like a river 
We've got giant brains goddamit
Who needs a fucking liver

Through cold-ass fucking winters
And heart crushing breakups
Through late nights at the Library 
And phone-alarm wakeups

Through all of the trauma 
Of that hard Berkeley Grind 
A semester at Berkeley
Is the best you can find 

So here's to the fall
And the coming Spring months
And prepare for more fun
Cause you only live once
