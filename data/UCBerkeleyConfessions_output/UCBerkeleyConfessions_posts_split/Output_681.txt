cking done with all this racism and sexism movement bullshit. I grew up in a conservative neighborhood, but went to a highly liberal, mixed high school about an hour away and you know what I've noticed in the time I spent there?? Nobody gives a legitimate fuck about that shit anymore! The only people stressing the importance of racism/sexism or getting worked up over it are insecure people and pretentious "socialites." And while there are many cures to insecurity and cocky peppiness, I don't believe that the race/sexism discussions will solve anything. 
Now don't get me wrong. I believe in and cherish equal rights as much as the next American, but this is utter bullshit. Do you want to know how to cure "racism"? Stop talking to about it. "But white people have.." "But black people.. " No. No, just stop. By pointing out demographic "flaws" you're only making it a lot worse. You're discriminating against yourself as a human by panicking that you're being discriminated upon by race. I've shared this view before with my peers and many have called me "ignorant" and "selfish" for overlooking cultural positions. But - what cultural positions? I understand you feel obliged to have an identity tied to your roots - (ex. young, underrepresented woman from Nigeria) - but guess what? You live in America now. And for heaven's sakes, you go to Berkeley. And I'm not saying that being attached to an identity is bad - rather, it's something you should be immensely proud of! I'm just saying that it's not something to create campuswide issues about. I mean, Berkeley spends thousands of dollars every year on our African American/Native American/etc theme programs since so many underrepresented students don't feel comfortable here, among a sea of people that don't look anything like them. 
This is cultural attitude problem, if anything. C'mon. It's the 21st century. Why do looks even matter any more? Why does it matter if "only" 38 people in the UCLA freshman class this year are black? Why does it matter if I'm brown, black, white, red, blue, or purple? I'm a human being, just like you, with real veins and blood and plasma and cells. Why do we still actively discriminate while talking about social equity? Just stop talking about it. Look past the skin color and ethnicity; accept people for who they are - People. Not a black person. Not a native american person. Not an asian person. Simply, a person. 

(I know most of you are going to shit all over this, talking about how ironic and hypocritical it is that I'm talking about this when I clearly argue to do otherwise; it's just that I'm sick of this shit and didn't know  a better place to confess something that's been on my mind lately.)
