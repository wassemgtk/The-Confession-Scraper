k I am crushing on my friend. Well actually i don't know if I count as his friend. I wish I could be like him: happy family; ability to continue college with no financial struggles; more importantly, he has the ability to be patient to everybody around him and love all his friends gracefully. I really wish I could be like him but I am going through a lot of struggles now and had to take a lot of responsibilities. I really like him and I want to be with him forever because he is like the lighthouse for me. But I don't know what to do.
