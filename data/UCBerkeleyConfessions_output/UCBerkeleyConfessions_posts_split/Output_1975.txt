often ask me why feminists hate egalitarianism so much. I hate it because it creates false equivalencies and ignores the underlying social scaffoldings that enforce inequalities. 
One of my students (a dude, of fucking course), just to spite me…wrote an entire argumentative essay on egalitarianism.  There’s was a whole lot of “sexism against anyone is baaaaaaad.”  And there wasn’t a damn thing I could do about it because it was clear and well-researched. 

I may take it out in the backyard later and let my dog pee on it though…
