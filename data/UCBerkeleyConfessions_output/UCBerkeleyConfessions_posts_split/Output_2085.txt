stly think that only white people should have to pay tuition. Hear me out for a minute: White people are disproportionally wealthier than non-whites and our country as a whole will benefit greatly from having a more diverse educated society. Many of you don't realize how many times a brilliant minority student has to turn down an acceptance to an elite school because they can't find the means to afford it. Additionally, men should pay higher tuition than women since it is still true that men make more than women for the SAME job. The only exceptions I think should be for queer whites because they also are very oppressed by other whites. They are disproportionally bullied through their lives and much more likely to commit suicide that they should get a break for going to college. Furthermore, we should cut all breaks for veteran students. Military spending is the single largest portion of the federal deficit, and you want to spend MORE money on those who have participated in war? By doing so, we only encourage sending more people to fight our imperialist wars on the promise of being able to get an education, but the last thing we need is more people going to the military. If we can lobby for these things to happen, we can help end racism, sexism, homophobia, and warmongering :)
