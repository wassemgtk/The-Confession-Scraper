ne of the unlucky ones that was admitted for the spring semester. As much as I am excited to move out of LA I'm scared to death. Idk how it's gonna work out. I will hopefully get an apartment and room with someone, I have friends there already, but I'm honestly scared to death. Scared to be a failure and being on my own. I am very independent and for the first time I am scared to be. I have no type of financial help from my parents, nor do I know how to be helped. It's stressful already and I'm not even there yet.
