are a massively disproportionate amount of "grinders" at Cal; they game the system by studying all day every day, and unlike Stanford our admissions department doesn't do anything about it. i'm so fucking tired of taking math / stats / eecs classes, with mostly fucking talentless people who study 4x as much as I do, and can't beat me on the midterms. and don't even get me started about their complete inability to hold a conversation, or loose their virginity by the time they graduate.

this is the difference between Stanford and Cal. why do you think they don't release their mean HS GPA data? because it's probably lower than you would think, and probably lower than ours.

also, fuck Chicano / Chicano people who somehow got into Cal. i'm tired of paying full tuition here so you can major in Chicano Studies. Go to SF State for that shit; it won't make a fucking difference anyways.
