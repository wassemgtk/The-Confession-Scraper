o happy to be away from home. My parents are in the process of divorcing, so life at home for the past year or so was awkward and terrible. Holidays suck, because they are either awkward with both parents, or you spend it with one and not the other, or you're constantly running back and forth to see both sides. Plus parents get jealous...and complain to you about their problems. Stepparents and stepsiblings, parents dating random people who aren't your mom or dad...family members who take sides. My parents gave up on each other, and they play the victim card all the time. But really, the kids are the ones who hurt the most--everyone hurts, but the kids get it the worst because they are helpless to the situation.
