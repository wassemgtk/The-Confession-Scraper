cience major in Berkeley, I have major problems with some of my classmates. I hate doing "study groups" because there are those people who only wants THEIR questions answered and don't give a shit about mine. Even when they know the answers, they intentionally keep it to themselves. And there are another group of people who feel better about themselves by putting people down when you ask them a question. Even after you find out that they're wrong, they never learn. I hate that I am automatically seen as a "competition" and even when they say that we're "not competing," really, they HATE it when you do better than them.
