not sure we should classify “prison rape” as rape anymore. I define rape as ‘forced sex + power’, and men have all the power in the world, especially white men, who are more likely to have sex forced on them in prison, which proves that karma exists.

But then I have to apply this to white women. White women have the privilege of being white, but also the disprivilege of being female. It is a clash of powerful and powerless. So how does it work out? Either white women are incapable of being raped because of their white privilege, or they are capable of being raped, and raping female people of color is DOUBLERAPE.

I’ll let you decide.

Addendum: But I’d rather not have white women weigh in on this, as I fear their bias will lead them all to say “no, we can’t be raped”, because no one wants to be able to experience the worst thing in the world. We need outsiders looking in, because insiders can’t check their biases and privileges
