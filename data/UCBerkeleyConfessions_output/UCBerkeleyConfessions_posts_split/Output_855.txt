young person with high functioning autism, and I've struggled a lot from depression and isolation in the past due to my condition. I was told numerous times that I'd be better off in community college despite my hard work, and my biggest fear coming here was going unnoticed the way I had been in high school and middle school. But since coming to Cal, I've made many more great memories and friends here in the last 3 months compared my whole life back at home. I've been able to support myself and pay a fair amount of my tuition through work despite being told I'm not capable of taking care of myself. I volunteer with the most amazing children who give me every reason to be where I am and stay there. And when I'm done with my 3-4 years here, I'm going to get a master's in occupational therapy so I can help those with special needs lead better lives like I've been able to. I might have a "disability", but I've been able to do many more things here than I ever thought possible otherwise. I still have hard days now and then, but I can surely say coming to Cal has been the best decision I've ever made. I've never loved my life more than I do right now, and more than anything else I want to use my intelligence and talent to change the world for the better.
