is my birthday, and there is nowhere else I would rather be. Everyone I know in Berkeley is kind, responsible, and caring. Throughout the day my friends have been offering to take me out to eat and been sending unbelievably sweet birthday messages. I just wanted to post this here to say thank you to all the people who make Berkeley an amazing place and the friends I have made these last 2 years that have made me happier than I have ever been in my life. You're all amazing people in your own way and I hope you all have a fantastic day!
