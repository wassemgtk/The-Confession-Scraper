s the same person that posted the human trash comment yesterday.

I stand by what I said. If you all are ignorant enough that you think the world we live in is all fuzzy and warm, then you obviously haven't seen shit. You've probably never gotten jumped walking back from a late class, or had your phone stolen by a guy on a bike or two ladies in a car. You probably haven't been raped, or had an insane woman attack your floormate near people's park when walking back from CREAM. Or had a drunk homeless person follow them home. Each one of these things I have either seen personally or heard from people I know.

You guys are right, most homeless people and mentally unstable people are good people in bad situations, but by just letting them live here on the streets and in people's park it is not a good, safe place for them, and it's not good for the people and students living in this city. Let them live somewhere else. It invites other unsavory characters to come in. Crimes are way up this year, ghetto "people of all colors" (blacks) from Oakland/Downtown Berkeley rob people at gunpoint ON MAIN CAMPUS. Read the newspaper. Just cuz it hasn't happened to you, doesn't mean it won't.

And thanks for telling me to jump off a bridge. That's exactly the type of inclusivity that makes living in Berkeley difficult. As soon as you have an opinion that goes against the Berkeley Golden Bear Ideals, you get shit on. What kind of free speech and acceptance is that?

Sorry your mom's mentally unstable, but at least she's working. Can you say that much for those on the streets? Drug addicts and beggars are not adding anything to our city. We need to get these people help, or something, but they shouldn't stay here.
