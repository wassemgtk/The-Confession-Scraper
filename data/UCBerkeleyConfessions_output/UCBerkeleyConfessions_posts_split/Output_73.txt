gorgeous blonde with incredible hair who works at moffitt library. I'm am stunned by your beauty. I didn't think it was possible for a simple smile to freeze me like a deer caught in headlights. It's been weeks and I can not get you out of my head. Someday soon I'll undergo the surgery necessary to remove the foot from my mouth and ask you for your name. Until then I'll just keep walking by the check in station with feigned disinterest. 

Sincerely,
