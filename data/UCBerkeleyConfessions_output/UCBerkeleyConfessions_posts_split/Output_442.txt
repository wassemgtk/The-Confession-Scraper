a squirrel with a swastika spray painted on it yesterday. Honestly? I know college is supposed to be fun, blah blah blah, but what is okay about spray painting animals? And a swastika? What is this campus community come to? Honestly I'm just upset and frustrated it happened but I don't really know what to do about it. Any advice?
