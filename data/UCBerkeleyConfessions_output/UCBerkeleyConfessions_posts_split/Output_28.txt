seats are hard to come by in the library during RRR and finals week. Leaving your stuff there a short while is ok, but the seats next to me have been vacant for 45 and 90 minutes respectively while the people's stuff is still there. I'm getting interrupted because people keep approaching to take a seat that isn't vacant. If you are leaving for longer than it takes to grab a drink or use the restroom, give up your seat. You have no manners or class. You know who you are.
