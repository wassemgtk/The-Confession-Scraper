highschool student. I fell for him last year and he moved to berkley! I didn't tell him how much I love him and I won't be able to do it because of his pride! I thought this would be the only way to say what was stuck in my heart for a year now! When he left.. I felt like he took a part of me with him! Even though he made me mad many times, I kept telling myself don't msg him but I miss him really bad so I go up to him for different reasons! I heard from someone that he has feelings for me but I'm not sure if it's true! Please help me :( what should I do I can't stop thinking about him! (But I can't also tell him about my feelings) I couldn't explain it any better hope it's clear enough to understand
