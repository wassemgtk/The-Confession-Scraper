mess. I'm so fiscally irresponsible and I don't know what to do about it. My parents live back in china and send me money for living and tutoring and the like, I play a chinese MMO and all I can think about is getting the coveted "three suns" item. I'm hopelessly addicted and it's stopping me from even going to class It's stupid and I've spent hundreds, if not thousands trying to get another virtual item.

I need help, i'm wasting my money and my time.
