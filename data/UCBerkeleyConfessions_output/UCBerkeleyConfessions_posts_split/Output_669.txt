strange that I haven't really found a "group" to fit in with? Don't get me wrong, I have the best floor mates but we've kind of separated into two groups. Group A which is incredibly diligent, industrious, and hardworking. It feels like they aren't having any fun...I'm not implying anything but all they do is do homework or study, even on a three day weekend when other people are going to Tahoe, exploring SF, traveling, etc. Group B is the party group. I enjoy frat hopping with them but I'm tired of always getting buzzed and watching people make fools out of themselves when wasted. Any suggestions? I've joined a couple clubs but I feel like my life doesn't revolve around other social events. I dearly wanted to go to Yosemite but my floor mates had other ideas -- drinking, doing homework, or just relaxing. I understand and respect that, but I wish I was placed on a floor with people who wanted to go exploring some more. :/
