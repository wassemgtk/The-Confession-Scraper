sians here are pretentious, closed-minded, and extremely heteronormative. i know this doesnt apply to every asian out there but theres been so many times i felt this way since ive come here

i also think the black community is very closed off to making friends of other races here. i mean i know that being black, you dont see a lot of familiar faces at Cal and you all feel disrespected/oppressed as a whole on campus so i guess i cant blame you for wanting to stick with your kind but i would like to make some black friends cuz yall are cool as fuck
