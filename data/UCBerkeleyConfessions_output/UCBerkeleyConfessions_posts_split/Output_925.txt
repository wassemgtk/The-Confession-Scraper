19 year old girl who's 5'4, black hair, hazel eyes, pale, a toned body. I don't know why but I've always been into older men. About 1-7 years older than me. Maybe because I can't stand men my age, there so childish and annoying. I love smart, tall, intelligent, gentlemen, and you have to be funny. (Scruff/beards are a huge plus!) I'm just curious is there any guys who like younger women my age? Lately all the great older guys are taken with someone their age or maybe they don't want or have the courage to be with an underclassmen?
