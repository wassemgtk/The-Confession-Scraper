nashamed of my frequent and foolish public dancing. Though I often feel like no one understands my passion for lindy hopping to distorted music played over a store's intercom... My friends just tell me to stop ruining the displays with my liberal use of mannequin dance partners. But hey, It's a free country and I can dance if I want to. I can leave my friends behind. Cause my friends don't dance, and if they don't dance, well they're no friends of mine.
