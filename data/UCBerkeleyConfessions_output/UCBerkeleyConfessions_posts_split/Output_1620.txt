ad over heels in love with my sorority (which is something that I never thought I'd say six months ago) but I just can't afford it. It's so difficult, and not to mention frustrating, to be surrounded by such affluent people who can throw their money around without a second thought. Money has become such a stressor, I'm working two jobs, but for what? I'm terrified of leaving because of the emotional and financial investment I've already put in. I just don't know what to do next...
