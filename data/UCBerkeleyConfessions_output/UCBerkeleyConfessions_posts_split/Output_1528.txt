guy I accidentally made out with and periodically bounce on,

I know we agreed to be friends with romantic wiggle room in the future, but I fucked up. I really like you. Like, like like you. This is all your fault. If you didn't do/say such adorable things, I'd have no problem just hooking up with you. But alas, you hold my hand and stare deeply into my soul. I just don't want you to run away.
