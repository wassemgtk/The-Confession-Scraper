to give a huge shout out to my girl housemates for being such big bitches. We got randomly placed in a small apartment of three bedrooms; two doubles, which are taken over by myself and three other guys, and a triple with three girls. The guys and I keep it cool within ourselves, but one of the girls is an instigator that makes the whole house feel like hell!!! She's abusive, manipulative, and is only a good person when she seeks her interest. To add to that, she fucking brings guys over that are NOT her supposed significant other. That cheating whore is making life miserable for the rest of the fucking house. I need someone to relieve my stress on :(
