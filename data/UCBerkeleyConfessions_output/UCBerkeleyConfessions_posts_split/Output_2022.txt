a transfer student into Cal.  I worked the entire time I was there, mostly in school related jobs.  I realized I didn't belong there when I noticed that everyone there was middle-class or higher.  I graduated, but feel I never belonged there.  Then I went to law school in New York, and it was the same thing all over.
