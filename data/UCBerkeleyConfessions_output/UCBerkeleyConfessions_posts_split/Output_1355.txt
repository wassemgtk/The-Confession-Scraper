this guy have been fuck buddies for a while. Recently it's been getting annoying because he's got a boring and useless personality (no surprises, he's an engineer) and I've realized how much conversation improves my sex and makes everything less awkward

Before I used to ignore his dullness.. He's tall and decently attractive and he's good at some things but his personality makes it hard to make anything more exciting. 

Yeah yeah you'll say it's a fuck buddy what did you expect but STFU this is my confession, and I don't want to hear any of you assholes calling me a slut or a whore because slut shaming is so 20th century.
