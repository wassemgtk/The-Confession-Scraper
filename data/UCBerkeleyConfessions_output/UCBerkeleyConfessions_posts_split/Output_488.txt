a very interesting reason for choosing to not pursue a relationship.

College is great; it's fun, it's social, and of course, academic. Studying alone takes up quite a bit of time. If I'm going to be romantically entangled with someone, I don't want to have to be "juggling" spending time with them studying and other obligations; I want to be able to devote more of my time to them than I have now.

I'm pretty used to not having someone like that though. I'm fine. At least, I think so.
