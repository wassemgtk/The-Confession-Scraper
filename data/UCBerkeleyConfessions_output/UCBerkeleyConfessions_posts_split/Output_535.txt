ck of people thinking that Asians are so smart.

In my film class, the teacher asked the group of Asian girls that sit in the back to open the window and they fell over each other like an old silent film comedy (minus the pies)

I said to myself:
How many Asians does it take to open a window?

Apparently, we didn't have enough because the window remained closed until the funky punky guy intervened.
