xcites me most about next year? Moving to an off-campus apartment and not having to deal with these incompetent cunts that work for ResComp. This is fucking ridiculous, I keep getting locked out even though I'm not using even one tenth of my god damn bandwidth allowance. And this always happens on Friday. They don't answer calls or help anyone on weekends. Fuck you guys. Seriously. You suck.
