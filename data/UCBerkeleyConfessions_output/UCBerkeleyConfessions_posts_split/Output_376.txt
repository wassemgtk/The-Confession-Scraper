ow that look you get on your face when you're concentrating real hard on solving something, and you're sort of fidgeting, playing with your hair, biting your lip? 

Well maybe you've never noticed, but goddamn is it the cutest thing and goddamn does it make it hard to to focus on the math, when the only curves I care about are the slender contours of your neck, the gradient of your hair falling on your shoulders, the obscure topologies under your clothes that I can only imagine and dream of.

And sometimes, when your hand is tangent to mine, and I can't help but notice the cusps of your nipples poking through your blouse, it induces something primal in me, some base desires, and I have to struggle to hide the expansion in my pants, the steepness of its ascent.

I don't know if it's feasible or not (we are subject to certain constraints after all), but to get to the point, girl you're quite singular, you complete the space in my heart, and my objective is to iteratively optimize on your convex subsets if you know what I mean.

I hope I'm not just projecting, but babe if you feel the same way, be my complement, let's close the duality gap, and let me prove to you the existence and uniqueness of love, that it can be unconditional and can know no bounds.
