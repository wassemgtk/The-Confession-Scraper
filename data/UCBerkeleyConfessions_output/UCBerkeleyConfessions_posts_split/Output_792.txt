arting to think that I'm developing romantic feelings toward my friend. The only problem is that we've established at the very beginning of our friendship that we'd only be friends. We even pinky swore that we'd always be in the friend-zone. Lately I've been getting jealous of the other girls that he talks to because I know that he's keeping up with his part of the promise and doesn't see me as a potential girlfriend. I don't know what to do about this situation so I've pathetically turned to the confessions page to just let it out into the open.
