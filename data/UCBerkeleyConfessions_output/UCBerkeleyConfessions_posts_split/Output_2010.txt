i-response to the person who wrote about asking people where they are from originally: as a person of color, I resent it when people do that. I realize that the asker is almost never trying to be offensive and that it's really just a curious question. But seriously. When I say I'm from the Bay Area, I mean it. I've never lived anywhere else. Nobody in my immediate family has ever lived anywhere else, and despite my physical appearance, I don't personally identify with some exciting foreign culture. I think it was the comedian Hari Kondabolu who said that asking that is essentially equivalent to asking "Why aren't you white?"  I also hate it when people (usually strangers asking for directions) come up to me and ask, without any kind of introduction, if I speak English. Again, they aren't being intentionally rude or anything. But I'll have you know that English is my first language and that I read more books every year than most people do in a lifetime.
