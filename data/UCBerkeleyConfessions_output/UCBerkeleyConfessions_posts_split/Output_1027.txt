when I was feeling really depressed about my life, I got really high and then took my skateboard to Underhill Parking, and bombed all of the slopes without stopping until my nerves were so frayed I couldn't feel anything except adrenaline.

It was the greatest thing I've ever done, and completely cured me of my depression.

Anyone down for a repeat?
