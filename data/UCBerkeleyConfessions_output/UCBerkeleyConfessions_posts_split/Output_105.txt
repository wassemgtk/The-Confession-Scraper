he only one that goes out of my way to avoid Telegraph on my way to class? I thought the cold nights would drive all the homeless, drug dealers, and drunk people away to People's Park, but yesterday, I witnessed a drug deal, a homeless man abusing his dog, and some homeless youth were blocking the sidewalk. How long is it going to take to remove the homeless from our streets and bring better restaurants and shopping to Telegraph? My suggestion: We should also start power washing Telegraph (like everywhere else) daily or at least every other day to get rid of the piss drunks leave and drive the homeless people away from their corners. Are there any clubs on campus that deal with local government to stop the madness?
