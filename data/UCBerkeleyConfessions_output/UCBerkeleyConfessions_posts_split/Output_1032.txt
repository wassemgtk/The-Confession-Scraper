nd of shy and i try my best to avoid conflict whenever i can...but what am i supposed to do when my roommate makes me feel weirded out? i'm afraid to change in my room since i caught her looking at me the other day and sometimes i wake up and she's staring at me and it's so uncomfortable. i don't think a lot of people like her and so she always imposes herself on me like butting in on all my conversations with my floormates and telling me what happened in her day and i don't even want to say anything to her i just smile and nod since whatever i say she implies i'm stupid. i really hate it it's the worst situation ever. she also spreads her things to 3/4 the entire room and i'm not sure how to tell her to stop. please help me.
