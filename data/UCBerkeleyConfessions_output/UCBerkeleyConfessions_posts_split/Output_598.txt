hough my friend claims to be passionate about becoming a Naturopathic Doctor and going to a 'medical school' to get his 'ND', I can't help but feel that it's a bunch of bullshit and he's only doing this because he couldn't get into an actual medical school. These people shouldn't be considered doctors and shouldn't be allowed to see patients and treat them as if they were medical doctors.
