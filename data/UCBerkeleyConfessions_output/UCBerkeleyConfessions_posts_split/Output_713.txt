facebook-lurking on one of the UC Berkeley facebook pages (can't remember which one, maybe this page??) and found the FB page of this super-fiiiine looking guy. I don't know how tall he is, but dude looked pretty tall to me and scrawny, blue jeans, long dark hair, and so so so emo-looking like the types I used to crush on hard-core in high school but then stopped when I went to college because this institution is lacking in my "type". Anyway, I saw this guy in person the other day and he made my inner high school self's heart pitter-patter. He's a real person! And he was just sooo cute. But that said, pretty sure he's a freshman cause it seems he lives in the dorms and I'm about to finish up at this place, so maybe you're too young for me. But hey you, emo pretty-boy, I just want you to know you that an undergraduate female on this campus finds you wildly attractive, so keep strumming that guitar. ;)
