rrently studying abroad and I have to admit that I miss working on four or five different midterm papers in one week, the multiple series of lengthy assigned reading that I'd only skim through, being critically engaged in discussions, pulling all nighters, the excitement of checking what's in season at the Berkeley Bowl, having just about any kind of food I'm craving at any hour of the day and having a Thai food restaurant on just about every major street. I think I miss Cal more than I miss home. Go bears!
