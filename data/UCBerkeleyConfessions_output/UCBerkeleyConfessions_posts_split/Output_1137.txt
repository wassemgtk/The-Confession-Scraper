incredible 18-year old entrepreneur I got a chance to chat with at Bechtel library, you are amazing. What you're doing is phenomenal and the way you held up the conversation on programming was impressive. 
Building your own company at such a young age is truly remarkable on its on, but your modesty and warmth despite all this is what makes you stand you. Just one request, never change. 
I hated that you had to leave and I never got a chance to catch your name even after that long chat, but I hope that I see you again - if not on campus, then on TV for your achievements. You deserve it.
