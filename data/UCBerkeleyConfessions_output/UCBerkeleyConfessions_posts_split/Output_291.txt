e been with this girl for a few (5) months and we became official 2 weeks ago. We are very good friends as well as boyfriend and girlfriend. But she is afraid to get a little more intimate because she doesn't want to hurt me bad if we break up down the road. I have very strong feelings for this girl but if we can't get past making out I don't know how ill last with her the next few months! Please help me I truly love this girl but its getting very hard! I don't know what to do!
