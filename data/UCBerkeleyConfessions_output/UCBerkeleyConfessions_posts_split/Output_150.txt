ally bothered by the steady increase of suspicious people around campus and south side. It's not just all the armed robberies that are up by around 100% since last year, but also just seeing all the suspicious looking people hanging/driving around campus who clearly don't go to Cal and are clearly up to no good.

I'm not bothered as a person scared of being victimized. I'm annoyed as a much bigger than average guy who doesn't leave his house without a large pocket knife, who doesn't want the day to come that he has to hurt someone while protecting himself or one of his friends.

Really, I am not confident in UCPD. The few experiences I have had with them were bad. The worst of which and most recent was overhearing one of them making fun of an international student and telling his colleague the kid's English was so bad that he just gave up trying to understand him and wrote scribbles on the police report, and then saying something to the likes of it doesn't matter because no one actually looks at the police reports anyways.

I think that part of my tuition is going to afford me a quality of education that at least lets me feel safe when I am walking less than a mile from home to campus. UCPD officers certainly make more than the large majority of Cal graduates, if their compensation is exemplary shouldn't their performance follow suite? 

Am I the only one who doesn't have confidence in UCPD or the current state of campus safety?
