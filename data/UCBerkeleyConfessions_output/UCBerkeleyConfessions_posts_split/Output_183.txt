out with this girl for almost four years. We come from different schools and we made it to Berkeley together. We had our first year and it was okay. I am aware that every relationship has its good and its bad. I really loved this girl with all my heart which made me never give up on what we had, even when everything worked against me. This semester she left me for this old mariachi dude that does not even go here, filed a restrain order against me, changed her number, blocked me from all social networks and gave up on me just like that.. Now she is happy with another man, while I am here depressed the fuck out, all I do is sleep and I am worried about my future at Cal. She was my motivation, and everything I wanted and needed. I honestly do not know how to cope with all of this depression. I am a broken man. I dream of her every night, so sleeping does not even help me deal with this. Has anyone experienced this? if so, can you please help me..
