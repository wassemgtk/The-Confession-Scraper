friend of over a year just broke up with me and I am truly devastated. I already moved out of his place, but I can't fall asleep at night. I am always thinking about him and wishing that he would take me back. His moderately-sized Indian cock wasn't bad either.

I feel like he dumped me to explore other girls, but now I am extremely self-conscious. Was it because I am Asian? Was it because his house-mates can lift more than him when the go to the gym? Was it because he is too into boxing now? Was it because he realized that he will never be a navy seal? 

I'm crying inside and I don't know what to do.
