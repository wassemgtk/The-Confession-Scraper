my girlfriend at a party a friend of mine from high school through in Berkeley. She's amazing: smart, funny, spontaneous - more than I could ever hope to end up with. Just the thing is - she's super passionate about Cal and has an avid passion for hating Stanford. Plot twist: I got to Stanford and she has no idea. 

As the UC Berkeley community, what do you guys think I should do? If I tell her, she will undoubtedly hate me forever. And if I don't, then I can't really bring her home all the way in Palo Alto to my dorm.. Every time we've "chilled", it was at her place and she's been hinting at wanting to see my place for a while. What do I do?
