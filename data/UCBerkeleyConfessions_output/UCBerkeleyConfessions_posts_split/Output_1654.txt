lfriend and I were in a relationship for a year. Going into college, we knew it was going to be hard being in a long distance relationship, but we agreed that we could handle it. About a month into school, I cheated on her once. I was lonely. It was the biggest mistake of my entire life. A mistake I will probably regret for the rest of my life. I went down to see her and she found out what happened after reading some texts on my phone. Afterwards, she broke up with me. I love her with all my heart and I need to get her back, but I just don't know how. What do I do?
