t want to have drunk sex. I don't want to have semi-rapistic sober sex with drunk girls. I would like to be able to voice me sexual attraction to women without being a "creeper" and have them be perfectly comfortable with rejecting me. And yet the current culture prevents me from being honest or open and encourages me to engage in rapistic behaviors if I ever want to have any sort of extra-relationship sex. I don't like that.
