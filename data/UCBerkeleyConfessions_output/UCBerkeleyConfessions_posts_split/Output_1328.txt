the Cholo,

We met last week at SigEp and thought you were hellaaaa cute.  I wanted to get to know you better, but then we were separated.  But then I saw you dancing, smiling and laughing with the girl in the little black dress.  Go for her, dude.  Too perfect not to.

Sincerely,
The Girl Who Still Believes in True Love
