u know that Kairos, a2f, Koinoia, Klesis are all part of one huge mega church (that claims not to be one, ha) that's almost cult-ish? Don't get sucked into the hole. They treat you really nicely at first then expect a lot, a lot from you. I've seen people give up their jobs (really nice ones) because they tell them to go help build another church at some random places. I gave out a phone number at the beginning of the semester by accident and the guys won't stop contacting me ever since even though I never respond!!
