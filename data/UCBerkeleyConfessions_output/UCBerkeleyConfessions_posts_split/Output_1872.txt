one else has a job on campus or through FWS, you'll know how fucked up it is that you essentially have to wait a month or even 2.5 months until you get paid. What is this bullshit? Why can't we operate on the same level as the rest of the working world and get paid on a bi-weekly schedule? We are students, we need the money to pay for food, books, and hell maybe even a little fun when we get the chance to do it. I am sick of the bureaucratic red tape that makes life so much more difficult then it needs to be. I took the job because I needed the money to pay for my schooling, not because I wanted something to do with my 'spare' time.
