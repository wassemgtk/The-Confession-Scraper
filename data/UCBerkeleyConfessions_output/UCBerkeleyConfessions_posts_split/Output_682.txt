Stanford student. Before you all boo and hiss at me, I'd just like to say that Berkeley was always my dream school. Somehow, I got accepted to Stanford but rejected from Cal, which devastated me. My boyfriend currently goes to Cal, and whenever I visit him, I can't help feeling like I belong more on the Berkeley campus. Even though I technically go to the "better school," its prestige cannot match Cal's spirit nor its passionate history. I think I'll always secretly be a Bear at heart.
