ppy because I'm privileged. I have clean water not only to drink or eat with but to wash my clothes and myself along with my bodily fluids every single day. I get to eat at least one full meal a day with some snacks in between. At least once a week I can buy a pizza from Blondies or skittles from the vending machine. Whenever I get hurt or feel threatened, I can dial 3 little numbers. If I have a rash, I only have to rub a little medicine and keep it clean with the water I have. I can watch a football game from a television. I can walk 2 blocks down the street to buy a doughnut late at night. I can type this message down on a computer with access to the internet. I have a heated room, clean socks, etc. to "survive" the cold days. Don't even get my started on how much my parent's love me. I can keep going on and on about how happy I am with what I see as "little" privileges. 

I am privileged so it makes it easier for me to say I am happy with "what I have."
