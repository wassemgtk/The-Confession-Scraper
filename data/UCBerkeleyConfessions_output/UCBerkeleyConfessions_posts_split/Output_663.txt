constantly labeling Berkeley as a "premiere institution" in an attempt to distract from the importance of actually excelling while at Berkeley are seriously tripping. Obviously the school is very good, but employment outcomes and average salaries outside of a few majors here are not all that outstanding. I understand that some people here aren't necessarily consumed with maximizing salary (and props to them for following their passion), so this message is not tailored to them. Honestly, though, in many major fields (consulting, investment banking, certain sciences, accounting, politics) Berkeley is regarded as a half-step or a whole tier below schools that many people here like to consider "peer schools," so it's absolutely important to excel while here.
