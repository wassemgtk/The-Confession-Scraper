yall with yo love issues and shit, just go for it! College is too short to wonder "what if" and if it doesn't work out, Berkeley is big enough that you'll likely not need to see them again AND because it's so big you'll be able to find someone new as well! Do you really think you'll have another opportunity like college to meet this many new people?

Just remember: Someone out there is looking for you just as hard as you're looking for them

Good luck! Luh yall
