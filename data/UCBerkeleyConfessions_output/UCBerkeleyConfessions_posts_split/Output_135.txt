rl in the darkblue/black and pink outfit at ihouse for diwali night..you are gorgeous, and your smile..it is like a little kid--cute beyond words. You caught my eye the minute you walked into the hall. You carried yourself so gracefully, it was adorable.The way you were inviting the people to dance was the sweetest thing I have ever seen. I wanted to come up and talk to you, but you were always surrounded by a bunch of people and I didn't want to make it awkward for you.
I wasn't sure if I should write a confession like this because I honestly think this it too weird and stalker-like..I would rather tell this to you in person, but if this helps me get your name, I figured, why not? 

PS- I do not mean to sound creepy. I just think you are beautiful and beyond that, you seem like a really nice person.
