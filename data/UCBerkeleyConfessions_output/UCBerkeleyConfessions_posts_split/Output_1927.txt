oticed that I'm always attracted to people I have no chane with. Either they're taken or don't even know I exist. I've sort of given up on finding a significant other and have grown extremely bitter since my last relationship. I'm bitterly cynical about this subject. I really wish I wasn't though. But even with so many people in this school I still haven't found the one that changes my attitude. If only finding the right girl was easy.
