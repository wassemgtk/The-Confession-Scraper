etty scrawny for a full-grown woman. I'm a little taller than 5 feet and I weigh somewhere around 100 lbs, probably a little less due to semester stress. I don't work out or run, though I do walk a lot. I don't try to restrict my portions or anything. I eat what I like but I simply don't have enough time in the day to eat as large a portion or even as frequently as I want to. Even when I do eat really bad, like the three month period where I used to consume on average 2 chocolate bars a day, I never gained any weight. I was still underweight. That said, I get really tired of comments from people about how I'm so scrawny that they could break my arm without trying. This sorts of comments usually come from my friends are significantly larger than me. I brush it off but it makes me feel sick and uncomfortable because these people have no idea how I struggled with bulemia in the past and how only until recently did I lose a lot of weight and begin to feel anxious about not weighing "enough". I have a better body image than I used to, but it's still pretty warped. I'm all for body positivity but why is it something reserved only for "fat" people? I get it, more fat-shaming goes on than skinny-shaming, but isn't it counterproductive to the aim of body positivity to hate on particular body types rather than promoting acceptance for all body types??
