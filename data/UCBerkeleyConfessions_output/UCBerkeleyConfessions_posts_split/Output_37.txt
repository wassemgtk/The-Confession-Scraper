into college, I was so excited. But now, I'm just miserable and regret choosing Berkeley. I'm in a triple, and my roommates only talk to each other. Whenever I try to start a conversation, all I get are one word responses. It just got to a point that I stopped trying to even make an effort to talk to them anymore. The other people on my floor are just as unfriendly and rude. Even though there are always people around me, I have never felt so lonely. It seems like everyone here has made close friends already, so no one even cares about meeting new people anymore. People here can be so cliquish. There's no one to talk to here. I miss my friends from high school. I miss home. I don't want to cry myself to sleep another night. I just want to get through with the next two weeks so that I can finally go home.
