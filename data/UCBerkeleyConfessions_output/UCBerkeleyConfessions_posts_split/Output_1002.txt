racist pig who was talking shit about chican@s and their majors. Trust me, I'm not either of those majors and I'm here to help my family in the future. Unlike you who probably don't have a job and just ask mama and daddy for all you wish, I ensure my siblings have a place to live, food to eat, and survive. I cry sometimes because it's hard to keep up, but you do to see me bitching about it. It upsets me when people like you, who had never been exposed to an actual struggle but what type of shoes to buy or studying for the SAT, say and try to insult us. Try living like us and you will overcome your ethnocentrism.
