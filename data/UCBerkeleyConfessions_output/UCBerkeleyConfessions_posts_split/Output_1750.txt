e some fraternities (SAE, Zate, DKE, AEPi, DX, SigChi etc.)  mostly composed of white and, if not white, rich? And for those more diverse fraternities, why is it that sororities such as PiPhi, ADPi, KKG, SK are just not into them? I am not against these fraternities at all (I party with you guys all the time), but WTF... seriously. I'm waiting for the day that SAE or DKE has an invite with Hermanas Unidas.
