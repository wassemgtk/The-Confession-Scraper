the girls who lift in the rsf/memorial stadium gym, thank you. you give me hope. you make me realize that not all women eat whatever the fuck they want and expect the fat behind their thighs to just magically disappear. i notice the women who lift... not in a stalkerish type of way, but in the sense that i can respect the fact that they are attempting to sculpt their bodies in a way that is not counter productive. 

so many girls i've spoken to say that they don't lift weights because they don't want to look like a guy........ you will only look like a guy if u actually produce an adequate level of testosterone.. which no girl naturally does. essentially, when a women lifts weight they get toned as fuckk... an appearance i'd say 90% of guys appreciate 

so to the women who lift i say thank you. i thank the girl i met this weekend whose ass felt firmly suitable in the palm of my hand. am i being a fucking sexist? am i being a fucking anti feminist? FUCK NO.. im just appreciating an aesthetically pleasing female body. 

so women... stop the fucking shit in the rsf that focuses solely on the elliptical or other monotonous excercise. the human body naturally adapts to the same movements (it basically finds a more efficient way of doing the same exercise)... to apply an appropriate Berkeley metaphor: you don't study the third grade your entire life... you move on to the next grade and then the next, etc. etc. because you're mind gets better... well so does you're body 

oh you have test? you have boy problems? you have insecurity issues ? get that ass in the gym and lift. guys won't judge you. they will respect the fact that you are trying to improve the  body you currently have. 

... and with this i say: 

may the gainz be with you
