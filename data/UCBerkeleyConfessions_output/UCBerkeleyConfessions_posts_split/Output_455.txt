yall that say "I wish I was brave enough to say 'hi', " there's honestly nothing to lose; perhaps a little bit of hope when they say they're taken or interested in the other gender, but more than ever, a simple "Hi, I think you're cute" is a great big compliment. Do it. Be brave. Don't let yourself tell you otherwise ;) It'll make someone's day and put a smile on both your faces.
