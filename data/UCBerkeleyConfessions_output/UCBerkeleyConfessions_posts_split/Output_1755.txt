instant butterflies when this girl walked into the store I work at the other day (I'm a girl). And I'm having trouble not thinking about her. But I don't know her name. I know the club she's maybe involved with (friends I already knew were with her), but I feel it'd be creepy if I suddenly started showing up so I could (maybe) get to know her. And I don't know if she even noticed me or anything.
On top of this, I'm terrified of how my friends would react. They're some of the closest friends I've ever had and I don't want them to push me away.
