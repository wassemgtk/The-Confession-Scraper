jected by muslim girl 

In discussion today we had a group project where he had to each write a paragraph about A Good Man Is Hard To Find. I was grouped up with a muslim chick (yes she had the doorag on her head and all), and 2 other guys. She was kind of cute, but I couldn't fully see her face.

Regardless, I still took the chance. Practice is practice.

When we grouped up, I assumed leadership and assigned which motifs that each person should analyze in a single paragraph. I told the muslim girl to specifically analyze every man and specifically discuss the inherent flaws.

After we completed the tasks and finished early, I asked her, "What do you like to do for fun? Do you party?"

She quickly looked up at me with a bewildered stare and her head motioned as if she were saying, "Umm... hello... can you see what I'm wearing? Obviously I don't party."

She soon replied and said in a sad mumble, "No..."

I could tell she felt trapped and actually did want to party. But I also don't party, so I replied with, "Same here. It isn't very fun. We should get together some time. Grab a drink, perhaps?"

Again with a sigh of disappointment she replied, "I don't think so."

I asked if she wanted to do anything. She again replied, "Nope."

The rest of class was just an awkward silence.
