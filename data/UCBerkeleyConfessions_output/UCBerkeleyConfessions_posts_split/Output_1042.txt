30% + or - 10% of males on campus leave the restrooms without even a glance at the sinks. I know the right thing to do is invite them over to the sink and offer a good scrub of the hands in order to non-threateningly pressure them towards good hygiene, but I don't want to come off as offering a sexual experience. I have a girlfriend. 

...I don't have a girlfriend. :(
