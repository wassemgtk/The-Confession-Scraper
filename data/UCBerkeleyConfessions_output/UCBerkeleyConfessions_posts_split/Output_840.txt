ut 3 or so weeks ago I broke up with my boyfriend. We were dating for about a year. The whole long distance relationship in college (he goes to college in florida) was so hard for both of use. The hardest part is that neither of use cheated on one another or did anything to make this relationship bad. I know this might sound crazy but I actually really miss him. I know that I broke up with him but I still really love him and miss him. He was the perfect guy that any girl could ask for. He always treated me with so much respect. He would never do anything to hurt me. The thought of him getting and sleeping with other girls just breaks my heart. Even though we go to different schools and he probably won't be reading this I still want him to know that I love hime and truly miss him.
