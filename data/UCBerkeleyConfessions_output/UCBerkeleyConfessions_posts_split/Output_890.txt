reading the post about the way Cal students made a woman wearing a red shirt leave crying, I just wanted to say a few things.

First of all, I just want to make it clear that I am not completely against the Stanford-Berkeley rivalry; I think a friendly rivalry can be great. However, some people just take it too far! For example, I believe it to be completely disrespectful that during the national anthem at football games some people yell "blue" over the lyrics' "red." Yes, red is the color of our rival school but that doesn't mean that absolutely every instance of the color in life must be associated with them. I personally find this insulting and disrespectful to the national anthem and everything it stands for. It might not mean much to you but to some people it actually means a lot.
