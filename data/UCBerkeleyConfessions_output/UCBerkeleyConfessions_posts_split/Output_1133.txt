hat most students would call "those people" who don't need to study very hard to get a 4.0 GPA. I don't show up for lectures, I game/workout/party day and night, and the lowest grade I'm currently getting is an A. Not even an A-. And because of that, I've always (and especially recently) had people say things like "teach me how to be like you" or "I wish I were you" or something along those lines.
Well, for those of you who feel like that and aspire to be someone else: stop it. I am special, and if there were two of me, I wouldn't be so. Just because I don't feel the hardships of school doesn't mean life doesn't throw other challenges at me. And when it comes to things like that I wish I were like you guys too. But regardless, I'm perfectly happy being the guy that I am, and so should you. And if I even as much smell a scent of my copy out there somewhere, I will hunt you down, and make you realize how awesome you really are. We are all born unique; we all better die that way.
That is all.
