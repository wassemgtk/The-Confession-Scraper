're one of those overweight people at the gym working to shed those pounds, I respect y'all. That takes balls. Self improvement isn't easy, especially not in public. 

But if you're one of those people who claim that being fat is beautiful or some of that PC bullshit, fuck you. It's not. It's disgusting. Stop deluding yourself, before all of America ends up as a obese wasteland because there's no shame in being lazy.
