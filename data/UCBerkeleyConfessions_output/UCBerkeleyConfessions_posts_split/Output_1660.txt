t know if you know this, but you are such an amazing person. You're beyond smart, extremely talented, exceedingly kind, remarkably funny, pretty darn handsome - just an awesome person altogether. I really like you, but I'm afraid that our friendship would be at stake if I made any attempt at starting a relationship between us, and I truly don't want that. Please give me a signal if you're interested, for that would make things so much easier.
