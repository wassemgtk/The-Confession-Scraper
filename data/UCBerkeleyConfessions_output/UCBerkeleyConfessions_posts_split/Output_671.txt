a perfectly happy, long term, straight relationship. However, since moving to Berkeley, and meeting some very sexy, intelligent women, I can't help fantasizing about having sex with a woman. I can't get the vision of making a beautiful woman shake by licking her clit. My boyfriend would never willing to have a threesome, but I can't help wanting to secretly meet up with a sexy woman and feel what it is like to have sex with a woman.
