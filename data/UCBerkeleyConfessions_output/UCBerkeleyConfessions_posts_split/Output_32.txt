SIs take their "job" too serious. I understand you 'care' about education and strive to teach a great deal of material to your students.... but seriously, that high horse you're sitting on, is imaginary. Really, it is. Preaching rights, equality, and righteousness, while enjoying your power trip makes you look like a douche bag. Grading down to encourage higher quality work (when the work is absolutely fine) is abusive and unfair. Furthermore, saying that grades dont matter and it should be about the education as you encourage us to go into grad school makes you hella stupid. You're not encouraging students to do better when you make them feel inadequate because you have self esteem issues. Stop acting like you're some hot shit. You're not. Given, you may know a lot - and thats great! But being a dick about it, makes you hated across campus. And its easier to talk shit about a single GSI who is on a power trip, than a GSI talking shit about undergraduates who emphasize your unfair evaluation of students' work. And I hate to admit this, but female GSIs seem to have it the worst.
