a girl during lunch today, got rejected.

was looking around crossroads for girls who were showing signs of interest. This one 6/10 heavenly blessed beauty looked at me, i looked at her and she looked away. I thought that was a good sign so I asked if the seat next to her was taken.

She was looking the other way so I asked, "How's the spaghetti today?" She replied with, "Good."

I said, "Yeah, I agree, but they could have put more sauce." She said, "Yeah."

Then she slowly started to scoot over but I noticed and asked her what her major was. She said Anthropology. I was waiting for her to ask about me but she never said anything so I said, "Cool, I'm a Pre-Haas major."

Few minutes go by, no more talking and she starts to get up and then I ask for her number... she didn't even acknowledge me, grabbed her stuff, and left.
