you look scary! And I don't mean that as a compliment!"

To the drunk idiot on the night of Halloween at Pi Kapp,

Yes, I looked scary. That's the fucking point. It's fucking Halloween, not national slut day. Sorry to disappoint your dumb ass. Thanks for pointing out the obvious and thanks for breathing your stank ass breath two inches away from my face. You were practically making my face paint melt. Get yourself some prescription Tic Tacs, homie, 'cause that shit ain't cute. You're dismissed.

"Your makeup is hot!"
"Everything about you is perfection!"

To all the kind people that actually liked my face paint,

Thank you. Thank you for not making me feel like some sort of monster and for knowing what Halloween is supposed to be all about.
