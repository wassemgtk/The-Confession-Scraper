so alone. Everyday I walk through campus, telling myself that it'll be okay. Every night I get ready for bed early so I don't feel like this anymore.
It's weird. I thought college was going to be the best time of my life...I mean everyone said it would...and I was excited! But turns out, it's been a disappointment so far. I've tried. I've really tried to enjoy my time here, but I can't. I guess it's due to the lack of friends I have here. I mean don't get me wrong, I do have "friends", or are they really? They hit me up when they're bored or have no one else to call. They text me when all their other friends are busy. If I were to just disappear would they care? No. I sincerely and honestly do not think so.
I'm not sure if it's me or not. I mean, I think I'm a fairly average person. So why am I incapable of making true and real friends? It sucks...I mean it really sucks. I don't think anyone deserves to be lonely in this world, but here I am...lonely as ever. I know it may seen like I'm complaining, but I'm a 2nd year student right now and honestly, I'm getting tired of this. Tired of being sad a night. Tired of being close to tears daily. Tired of looking through my phone and noticing that there isn't anyone I can call if I were in trouble or needed someone to talk to. The only people that I feel a close connection to are my friends from high school, but they're far far away at their college. They've made great friends, and though I a happy that they're having a blast, I'm jealous. And bitter at times.
What I want is just to be happy. I do not know what I'm doing wrong. I've joined clubs, but I feel like I don't fit in anywhere. Some of you may say "You're not trying hard enough!"...But I am. It's not like I'm an antisocial person who doesn't talk to anyone...though I feel like this loneliness is slowly eating me up. Maybe this in turn has made me slightly anti-social? I don't know. When I hit people up, we hang out...and that's it. I invite and invite and invite....yet I get none back. Does this mean they don't like me? I feel like they'll jump at the opportunity to call me when they need something...like homework help.
I hate my time here now. I know I may sound like an angry negative bitch now because of this long and sad confession, but in reality I'm not. I'm a fairly cheerful person and love doing fun and adventurous things! But I can't help but feel negative when I'm unhappy. Which is a lot. Sometimes, when I'm by myself after class, I feel so alone that it hurts. Like a deep painful punch in the stomach, and I feel so completely alone. Like no one understands. I've heard people say "yeah well this is college, get used to it"....but I've seen people around campus laughing and joking and genuinely enjoying their time with one another. Maybe a best friend, a close friend?
I just cannot imagine feeling this way for the next 2 years and a half. But what can I do? I just need an answer...
