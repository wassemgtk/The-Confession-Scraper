of have a problem with the fact that people seem to find it annoying that there are mostly asians here (and no i'm NOT asian, i'm black) Why is it that, having a rising asian population at cal means there is a "lack of diversity"? When white individuals were the majority, I didn't hear anybody complaining. Does that mean its only okay for whites to be the majority? Seriously people at this school sicken me sometimes, having many asians shouldn't be a negative thing. Instead of seeing people for their race which by the way is a social construct, see them for their personality!
