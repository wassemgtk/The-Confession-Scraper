uld think the first time we met each other was in the officer meeting, but you may not realize or remember that I already saw you many times before in Transfer Center while I was hanging out with our friends in there. Back then, I did not have any feeling for you because I think you are not beautiful and not special at all. But the time have passed, and I soon realized that you have a lovely eyes and whenever I looked at those eyes, it have made me feel peace inside me. And, you have done so many amazing things and you made me thinking why a little girl like you could have done and knew so many things.Beside all of those reasons, you are so kind; and especially, when I read your info on ambassador page, I felt like I am nothing if comparing to you. So on one night without sleeping, I decided to text you and asked you that could I have a date with you; unfortunate for me, you haven't looked for anything serious yet. That's why I've became your crush until now. On the other hand, I had so many chances to express my feeling when I was with you, but it seemed like I wasted those chances; because, I did not know how to talk you, make you laugh and I was like an idiot with ESL level in front of you. And, do you know the fact that it only happens to you, but not with the other girls; I can make jokes around, talk normally with other but I always wonder why can't I do that with you. That's why you may end up thinking that I am boring annoying, and can't do anything whenever you see me. But deep down in my heart, I always wish that you could be happy with whatever you're doing and could get achievement in your life. If you can read my statement, and give me a chance to ask you out for dinner or whatever events around the campus, this time I swear to God that I will express all of my feeling to you and tell you all of my thinking about you
Best wish with everything
An annoying boy who is crazy into you :)
