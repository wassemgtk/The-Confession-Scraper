making eye contact with this girl at random times each week and once in a while, she'll smile that beautiful smile at me and I can't stop thinking about her. A few weeks ago we even had a three word conversation when she had to run to another class. I saw her out and we waved to each other, but then she just disappeared....I mean I really like this ambiguous thing we have going on but I really want to get to know her. 
So if you are reading this....... I think you're beautiful, you make my day, and the next time I see you I will gather up some courage to talk to you and hopefully I'll be able tell you all this someday in person.
