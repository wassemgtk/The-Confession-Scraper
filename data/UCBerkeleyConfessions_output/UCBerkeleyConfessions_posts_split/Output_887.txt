gluttonous pig who stole my Ben&Jerry's Vanilla Bean Ice cream from Martinez Common's shared kitchenette, I've been saving that ice cream for emergency munchies. i'd understand if my ice cream was out in the open to seduce you, but it was concealed. WHY would you even open someone else's brown bag? you've consciously made the decision to snoop and steal. I pity your black heart.. Now I have to go to the bear market high off my ass. May your children die a thousand deaths. -_"- UGH!
