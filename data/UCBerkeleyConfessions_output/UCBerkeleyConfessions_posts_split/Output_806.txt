in a quad with three roommates. All I want to do is study quietly but they will not stop making noise with the other people on our floor. They are obnoxious, sleep late, and miss class everyday. I have to go to the library everyday to study and I do not feel at home when I am home. I guess I am only paying for a place to sleep every night. We signed a roommate agreement.
