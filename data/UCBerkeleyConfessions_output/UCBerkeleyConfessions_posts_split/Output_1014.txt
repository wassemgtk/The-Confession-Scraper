stly don't get these fucking Chicanos/chicanas. You all bitch about how disadvantaged you are; advocating that more of your own kind make it into colleges when the vast majority of you take up BULLSHIT majors like Chicano studies, ethnic studies, American studies, history, n shit like that. What the fuck is the point of going to college when all you get is a useless major, tuition debt and lost wage that you could've made had you just went straight to work. Then, you guys talk shit about Asians as the model minorities in your stupid ass ethnic classes without realizing that we became the ideal minority as a result of learning how to QUIT BITCHING about your fucking disadvantages and inequality and START working the system. Most of y'all are pseudo-Marxists, talkin about how the white capitalistic system is oppressing your people (using other buzzwords like: modern colonialism, cultural imperialism, economic inequity, social injustice and bullshit like that) when really the problem is that most of your kind are ungrateful fuckheads who, instead of honoring their parents' hard work and sacrifice, become punk ass thugs who get caught up for crime or impregnating some chick in high school and thus dropping out. Learn how to fuckin stop bitching and start hustling. Drop your fake ass majors and take up something that will actually create an ROI for your parents and our state government.
