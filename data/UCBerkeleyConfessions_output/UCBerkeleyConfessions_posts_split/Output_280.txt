rkeley's the number 1 public school in the world? Doesn't mean that your major is worth shit. We're number one in a few majors like CS but as far as things like economics or pre med, the Ivys blow us out of the water. So if you're not in a major that Berkeley is #1 in, shut up about how all majors are equally hard. They aren't. 

And before you EECS kids come out of the woodwork to brag, just remember that your professor makes fun of how L&S CS majors have a higher average starting salary than you guys.
