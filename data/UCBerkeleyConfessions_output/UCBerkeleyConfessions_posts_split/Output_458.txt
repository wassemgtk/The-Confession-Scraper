people that make cookies or baked goods for your floormates...thank you so much. You really have have clue how much I appreciate them. Especially when someone like me can't afford the normal meal plan so sometimes I'll skip a day or two a week on food ever since the beginning of the semester. Now that semester is closing, I'm trying really hard to not run out of the points I have for emergencies so whenever you knock on my door asking if I want a cupcake, cookie or brown, I want to cry because those are the calories that will get me through my homework tonight.
