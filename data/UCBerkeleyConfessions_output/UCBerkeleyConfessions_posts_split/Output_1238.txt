I have been running out of meal points. It's been up to the point where I am forced to eat my own shit. Honestly, I enjoy the taste of shit now. It's a taste someone has to acquire. Secretly I have been eating the shit of one of my floor mates who forgets to flush. I think I can consider myself to be addicted to shit. Do I have a problem?
