ght it was just my Asian friends. I was wrong. It's official, ALL Asians make ridiculously loud and annoying sounds as they eat. First, you aren't supposed to eat in the library. Second, if I can hear you chomping, grinding, sloshing, cracking, slurping, popping, smacking and swallowing although I have earphones in and music playing, then I'm not trippin'.
