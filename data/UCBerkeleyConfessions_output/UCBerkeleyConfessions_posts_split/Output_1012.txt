ly want to date my GSI. She is incredibly sweet, friendly, and actually cares about us. Would it be completely wrong to ask her out at the end of the semester? I feel some real chemistry going on between us, and no, that was not a pun or a hint to what class she GSI's for. Anyone at this school ever bit the bullet and asked their GSI out? 

That or my Econ professor... Mother of god I never thought a short haircut could be that hot.
