ired of feeling inadequate, lonely, and unworthy. I'm tired of being all alone all the the time. It sucks when I look through my phone and can't even find anyone to hit up to grab lunch or hang out on the weekends. The friends that I do have seem to only use me....homework help? That's me. All of their other friends went home for the weekend? Oh, I guess I'm free. Too poor to pay for lunch? Oh, I got ya covered. I feel like I give so much for friends who don't give a shit about me. I am merely someone they come to when they need me. Never get a text...never a call. I don't know what I'm doing wrong. No one cares. I've tried reaching out to people, but again they just treat me like the back-up friend. I am at a loss....I hate it. I feel like a piece of crap walking around campus all alone while seeing people laugh and having a good time with their friends. I long for that. I tried doing everything to meet more people, but I can't find my niche. I'm lonely. Someone please help before I lose my mind.
