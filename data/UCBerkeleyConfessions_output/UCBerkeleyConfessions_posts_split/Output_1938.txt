a really pretty (insert race) person. What is that supposed to mean?.. How is it a compliment? its like saying  "even though you're (insert race), you somehow came out attractive". When telling someone they are pretty you shouldn't put them in the category of their race cause it should not matter. Just say you're pretty.
