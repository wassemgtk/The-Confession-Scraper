o two weeks ago I was sitting on the 51b. An elderly woman comes into the bus and logically I move to give her my seat. At the end of the bus ride a person comes up to me and tells me I am a true berkeley woman because I actually moved, she then pointed at the two other girls that didn't move and complained about how many berkeley students don't give up their seats and are just disrespectful. It made me feel good, but it also made me angry. To those of you who weren't taught how to be respectful, stop being selfish and pretending you don't see them enter the bus. Just move the fuck out of your seat when you see and elderly or disabled person. You're giving berkeley a bad name and that's not cool.
