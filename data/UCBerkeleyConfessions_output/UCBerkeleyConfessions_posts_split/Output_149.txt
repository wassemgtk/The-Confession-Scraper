the ramblings of a possibly crazy kid, but...

Sometimes, deep down, I think of wanting to be put in some kind of prolonged dangerous situation, or sad circumstance, or some kind of arduous video-game like journey with friends, and then overcome it together. I just think it's... a beautiful thing, to be able to overcome the danger, the sadness, the obstacles, together with your friends beside you. In so doing, those bonds shine brighter, you understand each other more, and you know you can always count on each other for support. I know it's bad of me to think this way, since of course I don't want my friends to suffer or anything, but at the same time, I just think it'd be a very... human thing. To be there for each other during not only the happy, fun times, but also the sad, dangerous times... to go through together opposing sides of the spectrum of the human experience - happiness and sorrow, peace and danger, light and darkness - isn't that a beautiful thing...? Being there for each other only during the happy times, and not the sad times... that's not what friends are for, is it? 

It's taken a bit of effort for me to talk about this, so I hope I won't get shot down so fast haha...
