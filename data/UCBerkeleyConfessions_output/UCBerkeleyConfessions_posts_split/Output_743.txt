I left my Chipotle on my desk to walk one of my friends home to her sorority (ya know cause of the string of armed robberies that have happened recently). When I get back, my dog had jumped on my desk, cleaned out every last bit of the food in my burrito bowl, and then chewed up the paper bag it came in for no reason. The cleanliness of the bowl leads me to believe that it was indeed my dog cause it's damn near impossible to get every last bit of rice out of those bowls with a fork. But I kind of want to blame it on one of my fraternity brothers so I can guilt money out of them for the few bites of my burrito bowl that I lost. Am I a bad person?
