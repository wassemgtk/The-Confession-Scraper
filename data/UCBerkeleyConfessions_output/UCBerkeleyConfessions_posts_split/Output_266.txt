up without a male influence in a lesbian parent household. I have no idea how to talk to girls, because apparently everything my moms taught me about respecting them and being a nice guy doesn't work. I have no idea how to be "manly". I was never allowed to do sports as a kid. I actually didn't understand the difference between guys/girls as a kid and wore my sister's dresses when I was really young. Everytime a girl is interested in me my personality kills it, because looks mean nothing on a guy and that's usually the only reason they get interested. I have self-esteem issues arising from the fact that I've never had a girlfriend and I've accepted that I might be a virgin forever. I have no idea how to approach girls because they all give the "I have a boyfriend" lie and I get shot down. Unless I become an asshole and join a frat. Right?

On the plus side, I have a really good fashion sense.
