lfriend betty and i just broke up. we're both from san francisco, and we'd been dating for a while. The problem was that she wasn't any good in bed. i mean she was beautiful, but we just had too many arguments. I just cant figure women out. sometimes they're just too smart, sometimes they're just flat out stupid, and other times they're just evil.
