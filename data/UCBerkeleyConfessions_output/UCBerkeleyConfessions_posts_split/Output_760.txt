erkeley,

This is not a confession, but a humble request. Do something nice for someone other than yourself this week, whether it's giving a homeless man your spare change, picking up and throwing away the trash on the floor (even when it's not yours), or simply telling a friend (or foe) how much you appreciate them being in your life, it doesn't matter how big or small your gesture is, just know it'll brighten up the place. Also, do it out of your heart, don't expect to gain something in return - because life feels better that way.

Best,
Your fellow student
