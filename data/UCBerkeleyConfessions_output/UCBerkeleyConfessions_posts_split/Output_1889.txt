confess that there is 'no evidence' which proves that the Syrian government or rebels have chemical weapons. It is only known that chemical weapons were used. Even though the screaming microphone people in Sproul give me a headache, I am honestly concerned with how are media is spinning this case. Even more so is whether my peers are really even taking a hard look at this. Something is not right with this situation. You probably won't post this but I am legitimately concerned and feel this is a confession that may resonate with the students here at Berkeley.
