lecture before obnoxious kid that always asks cringe-worthy questions and always sits in the front row in the same exact seat. Five minute mental debate, move to take his seat. He comes in late, a look of small confusion, has to sit two seats over from his usual. Happy Halloween and three cheers for petty revenge, it's a good day :)
