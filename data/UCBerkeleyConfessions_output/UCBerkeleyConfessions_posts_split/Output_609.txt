ared that I will wake up one day old and miserable, look back on my life realizing I have made no great accomplishes, no grand gestures, I have done nothing worthy of appraisal, helped no one, done nothing extraordinary.. I fear unproductivity. I have so much adrenaline and drive to do something great that it brings tears to my eyes, I want to leave my mark on this world but so far my greatest accomplishment in life has been getting into CAL, I've worked so hard over the years just to get here but now that I am here I honestly don't know what to do. I have no idea who I am or what I want to do, but I'm so ambitious to do something great! I want to change lives! Thank you for reading this and taking the time out of your day to read about my life. Do any of you feel the same?  
-sincerely your fellow classmate
