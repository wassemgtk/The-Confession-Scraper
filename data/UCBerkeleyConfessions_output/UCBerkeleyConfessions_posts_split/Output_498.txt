t even know how a person like you exists. I've heard how you've been stalking two of my friends Ada and Smitha because they told you they don't love you after you told them that you did. And you tried to even find their classes and hunt them down? You need to learn what NO means and you need to back off and LEAVE THEM ALONE. And stop getting depressed when they goddamn tell you no. They said they only met you for a few days before you professed your love to them and they also said you got super depressed and began throwing shit and going crazy. On top of that  you constantly abuse and bully that Olivia girl in Unit 3 Priestly and she's come over to my room IN TEARS because of the way you make her feel. Like what kind of sick hypocrite does that? I've also heard you've also deleted your roommates essay for one of his classes for no reason too? Like honestly, you need professional help because right now, I can't even fathom how someone like you exists.
