een really depressed and I went through a lot during summer and the first few weeks of school. You can kind of say my mind is still paying for it, and in consequence I'm extremely distracted. It's only my first year of college, and I already feel like I'm going through a downwards spiral and everything is just falling apart. I want to take a semester off to figure things out and to get back on track without letting my grades or academic career suffer, but is that a good idea? I'm trying to suck it up, but it just keeps getting harder. It's already bad enough that I'm barely passing my classes, if even that :/
