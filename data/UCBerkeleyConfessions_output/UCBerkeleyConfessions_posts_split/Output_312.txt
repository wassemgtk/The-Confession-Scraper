lege career as a Gender & Womyn's Studies major is nearing an end, and I'm absolutely terrified of my job prospects. My possible career paths include:

-Patriarchy investigator
-Professional privilege checker
-Victim complex denial specialist

Sometimes I can't sleep because I'm thinking about how few jobs there are in these fields. I knew it would be hard, but I decided to pursue this major after realizing that I was raped by my boyfriend of three years. On our third anniversary we were cuddling in bed. I never explicitly said "yes," but he assumed that by taking off his pants and putting a condom on him that I was "asking for it." Men need to know that this is NOT OKAY. Needless to say, he and I are no longer together. My rape apologist lawyer told me that I "don't have a case," so I think I'm going to tell my ex's friends and family about how sleazy he is, and create a blog to call him out.

I know I don't always have to be a hero in every situation, but a womyn's gotta do what a womyn's gotta do.
