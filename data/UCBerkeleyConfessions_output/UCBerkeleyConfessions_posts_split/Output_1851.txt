g UC Berkeley confessions. This keeps coming up. White person complains about   'no white history week' type BS, but with pointless side of hateful resentment. Everybody says 'what you guys totally control everything' (true) but in really nasty way that kind of proves his point (WTF, people). And if there was something that was more or less considered a white person's place, people could vent about this stuff w/o harming others, but such spaces invariably turn into horrible slimepits. 

I'm just going to sit here on Sproul and sing God Save the Queen.
