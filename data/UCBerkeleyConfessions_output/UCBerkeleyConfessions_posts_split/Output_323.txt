grad student and back at Cal this morning to visit my friends. I was caught in the rain and was not ready for it. A nice asian guy came up and share his umbrealla that made me feel the warm for the rainy morning, and his cookie really melt my heart. I couldn't forget his face and kept thinking about him all day long.

Thanks god for bringing him to me, too bad that I was too shy to ask for his name, just know that he's a little chubby, was on the way to Soda (guess he's CS or EECS) and with a cute Minion iphone cover and his name starts with P... I hope you are not in relationship actually :)
