o not participate in the human concept of culture. We share one common way of life that encompasses our entire species without much variation. So you cannot culturally appropriate cats. 
I oppose demeaning and objectifying cats for entertainment.
The 'meow' and 'nya' sounds are how human linguistics interpret cat speak. These phrases don’t harm cats or maliciously misrepresent them and it is fine to use them in everyday conversation or when referring to cats.
However, the '' emoticon is problematic. It reinforces a cutesy stereotype of cats that reduces them to shallow play things, instead of the strong, independent creatures that they truly are. Cats are not for your entertainment. They are not to be looked at and cooed over. The '' face says that the worth of a cat is based on their cuteness level instead of their mind, soul, and spirit. It is disgusting how humans think they can dictate how cats should look, like they have any authority to set the standards of acceptable feline appearance. I know humans are nature’s oppressors, but are you so power hungry that you have to enslave an entire species just to uphold your unrealistic kitten fetishization? 
A smiley face may seem small, but even emoticons contribute to the culture of degrading and kittening cats that we have created.
