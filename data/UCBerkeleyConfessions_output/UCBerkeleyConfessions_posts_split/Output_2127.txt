times fantasize about taking a flyer from someone on Sproul, acting friendly, and then suddenly just staring right in their eyes as I slowly crumple it up and throw it at the nearest trashcan without even caring about actually getting it in. Just staring right at them. The entire time. No laughing, just completely blank. And then just walk away, with no words.
