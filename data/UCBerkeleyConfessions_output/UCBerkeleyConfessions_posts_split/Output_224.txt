as happened before in high school but I'm feeling that crazy lethargic/depression again. I know I'm supposed to be focussing on classes and my job but I feel absolutely no drive to do it. You're probably thinking "hey you got past it in high school, you can do it again!" It was a senioritis thing back then but right now I really feel like an empty shell. I really have no motivation to get up each morning to make my 8ams. Am I just being a jaded, lazy bum? Is this part of the hs/college transition phase? Any tips for getting out of this rut?
