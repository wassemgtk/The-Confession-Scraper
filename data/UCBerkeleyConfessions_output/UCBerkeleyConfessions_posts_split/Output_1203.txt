errified of graduating. I can probably afford to stay another whole year but I am 100% sure my GPA would go to shit as I have had a serious case of senioritis since last spring. I'm scared of the world outside of Cal and the more I think of it the more I feel like giving up on all this shit... Ironically. Class of 2014, how are you keeping up?
