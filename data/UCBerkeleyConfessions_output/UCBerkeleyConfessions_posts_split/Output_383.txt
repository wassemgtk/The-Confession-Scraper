me strange reason beyond my means of comprehension, I cannot stop thinking about sex. Yes, I am male. No, I am not gay. 

Ok here we go: ever since I started my junior year of college all I want is sex. I don't care who the girl is or what she looks like (as long as she is not fat... fuck that). The blood rushes to my cock and boom I fuck... but unfortunately, after about a few minutes I want to have sex again. It is only after I have ejaculated approximately 4 times (with a standard deviation of 1) that I lose my urge to have sex. But no matter what, that next day I wake up with a rock hard boner--ready to pursue my fornicating passions. 

I can't focus on school. My GPA has gone from a 3.8 to a 2.8 this semester. Currently, I'm rubbing my hard penis with my forearm as I type. It's THAT bad- - It won't stop.

No, I do not watch porn (I gave that up a while ago).... I masturbate relatively frequently without porn (definitely once a day). 

So I ask... males and females of bold Berk: do you have these issues? Do you know how to alleviate this tension formulating in my testicles? I need help. But damn... this conversation is just too embarrassing to have with my friends.... and I have a good amount of sex... according to my friends... approximately 8-10 times per week (with 4 different women right now). No, I am not in a relationship with any of them and they are all okay with me seeing other people.

Sincerely, 

A ridiculously sexually frustrated Cal student
