glad I don't go to UCI. Everyone over there is overreacting to the extreme over the whole debacle with Lamda and this is coming from a pretty liberal Black student. As people who have been historically oppressed, I know it is tempting to want to draw attention to all the injustices we still see in our lives but if we want to gain credibility outside of our bubble, we need to pick our battles wisely. No one believed the boy who cried wolf when he cried wolf the third time.
