student parent, yes I go to berkeley and have a baby, and I was at GBC today carrying my 5 month old son in a baby carrier and I tried buying a drink with a twenty dollar bill but the guy at the register didn't have change. A football ball player graciously payed for me with his CAL 1 ard and I would just like to say thank you! The struggle is real being a mom in college and your kindness gave me a better day.
