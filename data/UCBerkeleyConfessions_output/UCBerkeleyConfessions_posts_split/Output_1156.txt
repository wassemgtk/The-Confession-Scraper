een crushing on this guy for 1 year now. He showed definite interest but I would always reject invitations because I was super busy/too stupid to see he was pursuing me. And now he is dating what seems to be the most boring girl ever. Wtf? What do i do???? Is this a "snooze you lose" type of deal? I want to at least hook up with him before this year is over if anything!
