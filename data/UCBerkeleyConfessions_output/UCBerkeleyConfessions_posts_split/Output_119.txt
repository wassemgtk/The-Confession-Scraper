of the people that are feeling down, because of large number of couples that get together for the holidays. Please don't get into a relationship for the wrong reasons! Love comes naturally, and love is when you care about someone, pretty cliché right? Well, the truth is love is when you feel that way about a person. You want to make her smile, make her happy, hear her laugh, hear her voice, and have her presence around you. So.. in a sense you don’t ever look for a relationship to be happy, you get into a relationship when you feel that strongly about someone. So if you’re thinking, I’m lonely, I’m horny, I want someone there for me, you’re only thinking about yourself and not someone else, a relationship isn’t for you. Love is selfless, so if someone is there for you and you’re only thinking about how you can benefit, that person truly loves you.  Because of all the pain you’ve caused them, all the aguish about caring about yourself, and they’re still there because you’re happy.

That’s when you love someone, and even if those feelings are softened over time, it’s how you get soften the falls and work as a team to build it back up. People love not for themselves, but for the ones they love.

Eh, I guess I get some-what philosophical in the shower. But sadly, even if you do truly care about someone, they still might not feel the same way about you. In the end, sometimes the only way to keep someone you love in your life, is just by being their friend.
