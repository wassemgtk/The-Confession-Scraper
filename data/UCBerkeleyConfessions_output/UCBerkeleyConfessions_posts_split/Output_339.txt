mes I wish people would just be more cordial with each other. A bit of politeness goes a long way. 

When I came to Berkeley, I thought I'd meet more open-minded people, but instead, all I hear about are people bickering over which majors are better, how life is unfair, and how hard it is here. Honestly, Berkeley, you haven't witnessed what unfairness, injustice, and hardships really even are. Most of you are "first-world snowflakes" without a clue. 

So please, before you open your mouth, just think about why you need to say what you do. Stop starting shitstorms over nothing. Every major at Berkeley is available for a reason; they contribute in some way to society whether you know it or not. Every hardship you have here will only be a small part of your life. Let's just create a happier environment for this short span of time that we "struggle" through because it's only the beginning of your exposure to the world.
