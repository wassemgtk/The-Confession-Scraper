ly, I was thinking about how we ask people about where they are from - and then go on to ask, "no but like where are you from originally?" when it's directed to a person of color. Why don't we ask all people that same question? Sometimes you ask a caucasian in the states where they are from and they just say like  LA or something, should i start asking them where they are from originally? They could be from sweden, norway etc. Why is the question only directed at people of color? It shouldn't matter.
