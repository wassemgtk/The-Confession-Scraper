honest, I can't stand when I hear students saying that they "hate Berkeley." If you hate it so much, GTFO. Transfer. Drop out. Work at McDonald's for the rest of your life. Idgaf. It's so sad to hear this, knowing how many thousands of qualified, rejected applicants would love to be in their position. Not only are we the world's preeminent public institution, we also have a beautiful campus, a multitude of events, and a diverse student body. So again, stfu if you can't stand it here and are doing nothing to get out. I will continue to defend our university, because Berkeley is my home. Go Bears.
