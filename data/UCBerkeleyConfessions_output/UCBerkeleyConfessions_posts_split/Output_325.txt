a condition that is slowly killing me, and it hadn't been something I'd been thinking about for a while. See, I was wondering why I felt so sad recently and it wasn't due to bad events happening, but something as simple as seeing my legs become thinner every morning. Just tonight someone mentioned that I lost a lot of weight, and the connection finally clicked. 

I've been through enough experiences to know very well that I have power over who I am, but I feel the clash between this knowledge and the inability to prevent this from happening. Instead I exist within a blissful sadness, or a depressed state of joy.
