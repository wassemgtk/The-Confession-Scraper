t know anyone that listens to country music! All my roommates are into the same type of music and here my country bumpkin ass has to wear headphones to listen to my own because I'm afraid of being made fun of for it. My parents sends me tickets to concerts all the time but I never go because I never have someone to take with me. I don't like knowing what I like is an embarrassment here in Berkeley :(
