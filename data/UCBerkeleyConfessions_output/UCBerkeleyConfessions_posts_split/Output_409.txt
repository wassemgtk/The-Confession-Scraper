s a joke. It's a shame that they seem to be more concerned with writing a bunch of symbolic bills that really don't get shit accomplished. Btw, I'm hispanic, and I cannot believe ASUC (and Calserve in particular) wasted so much time condemning the frat that threw the quincenera themed party. Get the fuck off your high horse. We elected you to get shit done, not bitch, moan, and be sensitivity experts. Also, its REALLY hard to take ASUC Senators (and people heavily involved in campus politics) seriously when every ASUC senator I know drops classes left and right or has mediocre grades because their primary focus is campus politics and not academics. Its disgusting that thousands of equally qualified applicants got rejected, and ya'll are just dropping classes. That's all.
