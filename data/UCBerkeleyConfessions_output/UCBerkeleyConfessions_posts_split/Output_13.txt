people save spots in Main Stacks with their books/notes for extended periods of time makes me absolutely sick. Its a tragedy of the commons situation - individual selfishness and greed makes life difficult for everybody. 

If nobody saved spots, there would be plenty of spaces to go around all the time, so nobody would worry about saving spots. But since some assholes decide to save spots, space is limited and so people who ordinarily would not save a place will do so because if they do not they worry they won't have a place to study later. 

To fix a tragedy of the commons situation, you've gotta impose risks and disincentives to make most people avoid being shitheads. So from now on I'm gonna be the Stacks Batman:

Be warned, assholes of stacks, if I'm sitting at a table, and you leave and don't come back for over an hour, I'm gonna hide your things. Simple as that. Let this be a warning to everyone who uses stacks. In fact, I'll probably send pictures of the things I've taken and hidden to UCB confessions, with name and personal info exposed, so that we all can see who the assholes of stacks are. So if you'd like to risk losing your notes the week before finals, carry on.
