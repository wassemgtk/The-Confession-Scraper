k people who have attempted/ committed suicide are the most selfish, poor excuses for humans.  You have one life and you're just willing to throw it away because you can't figure out a way to deal with your problems? well fuck you. we all have problems but not all of jump to the easy answer of oh lets just die then we wont have to deal with these problems anymore. there are people dying everyday who wish for more time on Earth, and your selfish ass is willing to throw your life away cause you can't get your shit together? what about the people that actually care about you? that's basically like a huge fuck you to them and how they're not worth the trouble of trying to figure out another solution to your problems. well here's a huge fuck you. you deserve to be dead. 

signed someone who knows first hand the effects of suicide.
