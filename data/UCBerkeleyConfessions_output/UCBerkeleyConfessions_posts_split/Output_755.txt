orean at Berkeley who is not a fob...I'm embarrassed by the Korean fobs who hang around in large groups and draw attention to themselves by yelling obnoxiously and disturbing everyone around them.
Before anyone gives me shit for hating on my own race, I just have to point out that they are obviously rude and inconsiderate and give all of the Koreans and Asians as a whole a bad rep.
