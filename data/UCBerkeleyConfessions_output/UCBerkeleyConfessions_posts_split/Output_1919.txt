standing in front of my locker and I noticed this random girl look at me, and she looked away immediately. I peaked at her again and I caught her looking at me again. She quickly turned away again and walked on her way. Could she have been interested in me? She didn't smile but just had an eye gazing look while she looked at me..

I made sure I had no boogers or anything like that.
