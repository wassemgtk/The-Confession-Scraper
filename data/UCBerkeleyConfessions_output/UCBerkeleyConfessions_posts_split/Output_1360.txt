ertain guy in the foothill dining commons--

I've seen the way you look at my friend. i know how you casually scan the room to see if she's around when we are, how you find excuses to walk by our table several times during a meal when she is with us, and how you turn and look at her when you think she doesn't know. 

She knows, trust me.

She thinks you're cute, but gets nervous around you and ends up looking at the ground when you're around.

do yourself a favor and come talk to her. She's a darling, I promise.
