r Berkeley is making me more racist. My GSIs can barely speak English. The students around me in my class never speak English. Everyone other club is either Asian or Latino oriented. And all of the decent resources and scholarships are offered towards minorities or low income students. 

When does the upper-middle class white man get a chance?
