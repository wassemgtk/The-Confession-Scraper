k feminism is bringing about the downfall of society. All women have a self-entitlement complex upon birth. Eggs are biologically more valuable than sperm, and the brains of males and females have evolved to reflect this. In women, their minds are primed from birth to regard themselves as the more valuable sex, and this is true, at least in the reproductive arena. Men, however, are primed to regard themselves as less individually valuable than women, and this manifests as a willingness to take more mortal risks. Women didn't go to war for thousands of years. Women tend to shy away from high-risk jobs. 95% of workplace deaths are men. Women have the power when it comes to sex. And now that feminism is "empowering women", the one thing that most men traditionally had to make sure their genetic lineage went on, their ability to provide, has gone down the drain. In the old days, if a woman cheated and was found out, she could be left with nothing. Now, in the era of "let's-give-everything-to-women-who-divorce" laws and Obamacare, women can go out ride the cock carousel and cuckold their husbands without repercussion. Marriage used to be a retirement plan for women - as long as they stayed loyal. Now, women can be as slutty as they want, because the state doesn't care. Alimony and child support payments will keep her nicely afloat at the cost of her poor sucker ex-husband. And that child might not even be his. Feminism: giving women the upper hand because all the Aces and Kings they hold in the sexual selection market aren't enough.

I fucked a feminist on her roommate's bed today. I enjoyed making her wince in pain with every thrust during anal. Then I wiped a little bit of the shit underneath her desk when she left the room. I told her all of this when she came back. To be fair, I did feel a little bad, but only because she was cute. I guess not all feminists are ugly.
