'm nervous, especially studying for midterms, I clip my toenails, put them on a little plate, and chew them. It's like biting my nails, but better because my fingers are flawless. recommended if you need a study snack, basically no calories, because it'll just be recycled into you, and it's basically harmless but I'd advise locking the door before you do it im always scared my roommate will think im a little weird
