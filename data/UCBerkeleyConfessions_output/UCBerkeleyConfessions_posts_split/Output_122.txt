girl named anchal (sorry i dont know how to spell it) the beautiful girl that looks Persian but says she's Indian and lives in Griffiths unit 2: you are beautiful. You're in my PoliSci 5 discussion and everything you say intimidates me. You're smart,funny, charismatic, independent as fuck, and super knowledgeable. I saw you walking today. You are way too beautiful to be crippled. Maybe during discussion I'll ask you how it happened. Till then, stay beautiful. P.S. I saw you at Starbucks once too writing in a notebook. Your writing is almost as beautiful as you.
