ey is full of fake people. This is especially true in the Asian fraternities where dudes try to act all hard and shit when they come from well to do families. But when you call them out in person they shy away like a little bitch. The difference between you and me is that I am actually from the hood. I'm not afraid to lose anything like you because my parents ain't got no money nor connections to bail my ass out. Just be who you are, stop trying to micmic hood swag culture cuz you aint got it. You look retarded. I have hella swag and I aint even got to try. Peace.
