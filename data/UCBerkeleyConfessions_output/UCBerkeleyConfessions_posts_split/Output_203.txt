you at a coop a few weeks ago. We danced and then talked for a long time. You came back to my apartment and I had an awesome time getting to know you. I can still smell your scented perfume and shampoo on my pillowcase - I haven't washed it yet. I called you a week later, i was scared you wouldn't pick up, and you didn't. It crushed me. I saw you on Sproul the other day, but you avoided me. I miss you; call me. Pick me, choose me, love me.
