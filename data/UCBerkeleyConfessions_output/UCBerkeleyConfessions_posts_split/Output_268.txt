Berkeley:
Thank you for hosting me on 11/20/13.  Those misguided hippies at my school in Santa Cruz shut the campus down and canceled classed over a protest they can barely articulate.  It is a sad day when the minority can dictate to the majority  So did I sit in my apartment on campus and waste my time like all the other Slugs? Hell no! I went to the Main Stacks to get a lot of good research for a paper!  The Doe staff was friendly and I always love coming to Berkeley! I will be back again soon and GO BEARS!
