ay sound wholly superficial, but please do help me, or even just hear me out.
I feel depressed. Everyday makes me fall deeper and deeper into a pit of shame and depression. Throughout high school, I was not the most popular guy at school. Sure, I had one or two girls like me, but that was all. I never had a girlfriend, never had anyone to just cuddle with and talk about stuff. I came to college looking for a girlfriend. Of course, I put grades first, and I have kept those up. But I've been trying hard: going on dates with girls, trying to expand my social group, talking to everyone, just putting myself out there. Nothing seems to be working for me; girls are always flaking on me left and right. I don't understand what's a signal of attraction; I've had too many bad experiences in the past and I'm afraid of acting too aggressive and coming off as creepy, annoying, or overbearing. I'm not the worst looking guy out there, but then again not the best. Every time I try to get a girl to be attracted to me I ultimately fail, and this cycle has gradually lowered my self confidence to the point where I don't have any at all. Any tips out there to help a guy out? Thank you.
