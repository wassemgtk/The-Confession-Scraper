t know why the fuck EECS majors think so much of themselves. I chose L&S CS mainly because I wanted to do business as well. But I could have easily gotten into EECS, so to those EECS majors who think that they are the bomb. Think again because there are others out there who might be as smart or smarter than you even though they chose a different path to take.
