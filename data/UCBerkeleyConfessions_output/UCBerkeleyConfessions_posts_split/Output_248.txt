this is weird but I'm sharing so that hopefully others do the same can feel more comfortable with themselves.  :)

Every Friday between 10-1030 (the only time I know my roommate is gone for sure) I get out my hairbursh from under my bed and dip it in a jar of honey.  Once its nice and lathered up I then roll it in trail mix until it has a nice coating.  I then sneakily go down to the unit kitchen and microwave it for a good 10-15 mins.  (sorry if youve had to wait on me there but this shit is important to me)  Once prepared I bring the brush back up to my room and lather its now bumpy wax-like exterior in a Teriyaki/A-1 marinade until its glistening all around.  After thats done I wrap it entirely in double sided tape and then roll the sticky exterior in some cajun trail mix (real cayenne pepper).  I then proceed to vigorously plunge it into my anus and remove it each time with a twisting motion.  I usually bite down on a sweaty sock to keep my suitemates from hearing my gasps of pleasure.  When I'm near an anal queef I give it one last good plunge and then force myself to sneeze while I yank it out as hard and as viciously as I can.  Once the  deed has been done (and we're approaching the 1030 mark) I drop the brush into the clothing donation bin outside my unit.

So I just wanted to post this so you know that its not weird and that you're not alone.  There's power in numbers!  :)
