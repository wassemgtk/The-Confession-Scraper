ht a big box of sidewalk chalk, and the only thing I can think to do with it is draw big swastikas on every building on campus. Not because I'm a racist or believe in any of the ideals of Naziism, but because it is the most fun thing to speed chalk. I can make one in about 15 seconds, which isn't quite fast enough to do it without someone noticing. 

I need to increase my speed. Five second swastikas are ideal.
