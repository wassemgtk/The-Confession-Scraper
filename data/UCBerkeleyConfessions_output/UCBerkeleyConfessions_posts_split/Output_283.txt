ider myself a fairly handsome dude and I also have above average gainz from liftin' at the RSF. Every time I get a new crush and they don't initially seem interested, I pursue them with more vigor, but once they start to show signs of liking me back I slowly lose interest in them. No, I'm not just a douchebag trying to play with the hearts of women, i genuinely like them at first. Is it just me or does this happen to anyone else? I might be scared of commitment, I'm not sure. Any input from knowledgeable Psych majors would be greatly appreciated.
