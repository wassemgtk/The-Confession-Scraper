guy I walked passed today (11/12) on Memorial Glade: you were wearing a black "CALI" shirt of some sort. We made some killer eye contact as we passed. I'm not sure if you noticed me staring back at you with my glasses on but we both looked back at each other as we kept walking. I would have stopped for you but I was already late for my lab and my GSI fucking hates me. If there is a higher power we will meet again
