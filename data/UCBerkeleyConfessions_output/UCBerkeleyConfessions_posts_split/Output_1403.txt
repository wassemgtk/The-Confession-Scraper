homeless lady I was sitting across from on the bus today: I'm really, really sorry that I zoned out while looking directly at you and made you feel uncomfortable. I was so surprised when you jolted me out of my braindead stupor by glaring at me and yelling, "I don't give a shit!" I wasn't intentionally staring at yo u or trying to make you feel bad, and again, I'm really sorry.
