tudent of color, I will never let my children major in Ethnic Studies. My father is an oncologist and my mother is a nurse who specializes in anesthetics. Neither of them got to where they are by blaming White people for every misfortune they've had and using 'White privilege' as an excuse. Similarly, my mom didn't get where she is by blaming 'patriarchy' for all the obstacles she faced as a women. My parents now make more than the majority of White Anglo Americans, are satisfied in their professional careers, and have 3 children who are either university students or university bound and have led stable lives. You will get nowhere in life if you let 'White privilege' hold you back, and Ethnic Studies courses do nothing but teach minorities and women that we are victims of the White Man (I've had the unfortunate experience of taking 2 such courses). I don't need special help just because I am a minority, I am perfectly capable of succeeding without government help or the pity of these White liberals who feel White-guilt or the 'solidarity' of these White-hating minorities. If you major in something like Ethnic Studies and then wonder why you have no high-paying career prospects after college, don't blame that on the White Man; it's nobody's fault but your own.
