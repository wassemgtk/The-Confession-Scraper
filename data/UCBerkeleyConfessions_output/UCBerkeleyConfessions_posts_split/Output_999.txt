end seems to get jealous when I hang out with other people. When I hang out with other people he suddenly becomes rude and in a bad mood or just stand-offish towards me. I don't understand why someone can get jealous over their friends hanging out with someone else, a true friend should be more supportive and it's not like I'm ditching him or anything. What makes this more confusing is that when he and I actually hang out he treats me like shit anyways, he's not supportive, he puts me down and to make it worse he doesn't treat any of his other friends like that, so I don't get it. Is he a true friend?
