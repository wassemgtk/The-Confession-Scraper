king hate padded/pushup bras. They're freaking ridiculous. Not only are they false advertising (like seriously, wearing pushup bras is like wearing underwear with padding to make your booty look bigger), but they make boobs look downright ludicrous. Boobs pushed up until they're right under your chin? No thanks. Fuck those huge puffs of material you call bras. I'll stick with my unlined, lace ones.
