I should get over you.  We agreed on a month of no contact to just give each other space, but really I shouldn't keep holding onto hope that things will work out in that way.  I keep telling myself to try and move on.  I'm sorry for having imposed my feelings upon you when I wasn't even too sure about how you felt.  I hope you'll be doing much better without me...at least one of us should end up happy out of all this.  However long it takes, I hope we'll be close friends again someday.  I still love you; I'll try to convert that love into something more platonic.  Sorry for the troubles...
