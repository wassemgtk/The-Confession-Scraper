guy in Noteworthy a cappella with glasses and the Cal beanie who performed at Laugh Your Axe Off tonight... you are so cute! this is the second time i've seen you perform, and i was hoping to go up and talk to you after the show tonight but y'all ran off :( so, this'll have to do for now.  maybe one day we'll meet, but until then, just know that i smile every time i see you and wish i could see you more often :)
