een is the one night of the year I get to be myself. I usually act really manly around my guy friends. I say "swole" and "jacked" a lot, play lots of games with them, talk about girls, and try to be straight as possible since I don't know if they'll accept me if I'm gay (a lot of them are really conservative). Halloween night, I got to wear my fairy wings and laugh it off as a joke. But inside, I was tickled pink and a sparkling Brony.
