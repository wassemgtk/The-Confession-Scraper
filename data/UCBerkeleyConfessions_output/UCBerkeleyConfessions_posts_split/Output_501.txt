s your major?"
"I'm currently undeclared, but most likely MCB."
"Ohhhhh, MCB? That major's really cutthroat you shouldn't do that to yourself."
"But I love molecular biology, so."
"Are you pre-med?"
"Maybe. Not sure yet."
"Oh, well if you're thinking about pre-med you should probably just do IB. The upper division courses are easier and it's less competitive."
"It competition really a bad thing? I think that it would make me feel that much more accomplished if I do end up doing well in the major."
"It is if you want to get into med school. Odds are if you don't have a stellar GPA, you won't get in. You should probably go for an easier major."

istg, this is a recurring conversation in my life. I am pretty sure I want to do Molecular and Cell Biology and if I'm going to change my major in the future ('cause, hey, I probably will), it's going to be because I realize my passion in another subject, not because I think another major is "easier." Why is it that people are so quick to shy away from a challenge?! We are in college, people. And even though I'm just a freshman, I'm pretty sure this isn't a place to strive to be the very best; this isn't a place to adjust your major just so you can get a better GPA. I'm pretty sure this is a place to learn. To change one's life for the better. To build a FUTURE. So honestly, I could care less if my GPA is less than "stellar" by the time I graduate. I could care less if med schools don't want me because my grades are subpar. At least I will know that I didn't spend four years constantly taking classes and pursuing majors that would better ensure me coveted 'As.'
