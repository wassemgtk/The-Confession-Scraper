my fraternity's dog more attractive than the majority of women at Cal, though not in a sexual way cause that would be just wrong... you sick bastard. She looks like the sound a beer makes when you first crack it open. Hanging out with her is like when you finally dislodge food that was stuck between your teeth for hours, but lasts the entire time you're with her, not just that moment when you dislodge the food. Her licking my face to wake me up in the morning to take her out to pee is the equivalent of pounding a liter of coconut water after a night of drinking. On particularly cold nights, cuddling with her warms me up like taking a shot after doing a door shift in January. One time, I took a bite of pizza but didn't bite the cheese hard enough so when I pulled the slice away, the cheese didn't separate with the bite and dragged the cheese off the entire slice, effectively leaving me with a piece of dough and marinara sauce; it was awful but then I looked at my dog and it was all better. She's the tits, the cat's meow, cock of Khal Drogo's finest horse, Larry Fitzgerald's hands, Steve Nash's eyes, and my best friend. Well one of my best friends. Probably top 4 or 5.
