eone who was beaten up by their boyfriend for two years - if he hits you once he'll hit you again and next time it's going to be twice as bad. My boyfriend started off by pushing me and threatening me and it just kept escalating. Eventually he would choke me until I passed out, he hit my head into the metal frame of his car, he gave me concussions.... I'm a smart very strong girl yet I let him do this because he was such a "nice guy and loving boyfriend" 

Moral of the story = leave him the moment he becomes violent cus it's only going to get worse (way worse - to the point where your life may be in danger)
