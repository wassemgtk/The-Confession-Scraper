for the people in rsf who helped me and showed me how to use the equipments and pair with me during core blast class. For years I had been really lazy and tried to convince myself I could live without exercise. Lately I decided to join the military after graduation and I realized how unhealthy I have been all the time so I started to exercise. It is very hard at the beginning because all the guys are super muscular and girls are super fit. I almost want to cry because it is really hard for me to be physically strong (I am a girl). And I grown up in a culture where fatties will be bullied during PT classes so I worried about people giving me that look. But thank you my berkeley peers, not only you did not give me that look but also some of you helped me a lot, showing me how to do things right. I am really grateful to be at berkeley at this moment knowing that my peers are supportive and caring:) GO BEARS
