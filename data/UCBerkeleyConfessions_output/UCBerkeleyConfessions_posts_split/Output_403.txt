al football team,

You guys are horrifically awful and are ruining the name of this prestigious university. The only reason you are at this school is because you were brought in to win (or at least try to win) football games. Last weekend at Colorado, you guys basically gave up halfway through. If you aren't going to try, then you don't deserve to be here.

Sincerely,

A proud Bears fan who knows that his team can do better
