ople protesting against Napolitano on Sproul today are intellectually lazy. You haven't even seen what she's going to do with her position and you're already playing the victim role. Stop with that dumb shit. I admit, the UC system choosing her is pretty silly and illogical, but let's see what she does before we jump down her throat. 

Hell, she's already allocated a 5 million dollar fund (where that money is going to come from, I still don't know...) for undocumented students. Isn't that somewhat of a decent start? I swear some students just like ACTING like they're making a difference in the world, instead of actually tackling real issues we all face. They focus on shit that doesn't matter in the long run. You need the grades and stats to be here, and it's been proven that your citizenship doesn't matter. Stop bitching and get to work.
