ossroads,
Wtf happened to all the large salad bowls? you want us to use these tiny ass bowls now and I end up using like three of them just to get my salad did. The only thing I hear at the salad bar now is people asking for the large bowls. Tell the gangster ass dishwashing crew listening to tupac pandora to wash some large bowls already.
