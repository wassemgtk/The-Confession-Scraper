walking outside Hearst Mining Circle after just receiving my midterm. I hastily pocketed the blue book in my bag. Just as I was descending the steps outside, I saw two girls high-fiving each other with laughter. I felt anxious about my score, not having taken a peek. They said, "You got a 10 on all of them?" "Me too!" I felt like crawling into a corner after seeing them rejoice. I got home, looked at my grade, and to my relief, I got an A. The twist, those girls actually FAILED (10 points each was a D at best). They were rejoicing in their shared failure. So much for academic insecurity at Cal.‚Äù
