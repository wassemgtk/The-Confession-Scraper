tranger who was asking for donations on the Bart near Lake Merritt around 6.40pm 17th October 2015, Saturday,

I'm posting this here because You said you were from UC Berkeley. First of all, you're supposed to be asking for donations, not pressuring people to squeeze their wallets for you. 2nd, You humiliated me on the train right after I refused to donate and branded me as "someone programmed to society." When I told you "im not from around here," you completely ignored what I said and insulted me in public. Your attitude disgusts me, and I hope you realize it yourself before it becomes a big problem for you.

Sincerely, Roxas
