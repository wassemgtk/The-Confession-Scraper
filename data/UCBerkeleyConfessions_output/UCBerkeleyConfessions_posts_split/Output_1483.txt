t as gay, but no one really knows that I am. I'm afraid people will think I'm hiding this part of myself from others, when in reality, I just don't announce it to the world. Lately I have been more hesitant to say that I am gay as a result of the reactions and the questions I receive when people find out. Why is this such a big deal to people?
