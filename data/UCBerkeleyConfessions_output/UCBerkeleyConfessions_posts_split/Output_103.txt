girl who walked into me on my way to class and then got all pissy at me for not going around you:  GET OFF YOUR FREAKING PHONE WHILE YOU'RE WALKING or learn how to multitask better. I'm NOT going to walk around you just because your eyes are glued to your phone.  I hate to think how often you do this in the middle of the street.
