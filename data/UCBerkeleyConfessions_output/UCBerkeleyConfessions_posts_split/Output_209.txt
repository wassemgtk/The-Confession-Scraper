be been 2 years ago I noticed it. My drinking become a problem. I knew my point of handling alcohol but I always pushed past it, always knowing it too; I made an effort to push it. Then sleeping with strange men (4 total), I would always make sure I was drunk beforehand. Every weekend I had to have a drink. Whenever I went out, I had to drink something. Then the hurtful words starting coming. I began to say terrible things to the people I loved. The blackout moments became more frequent. So last year, I made an effort to stop.

I gave in saying "It's okay, I can have one or a few." I stopped pushing that point of getting 'shitfaced'. I've limited myself to only 2 at most. 

The part that makes me want to cry is no matter how hard I try, whenever I see someone with beer or go into a restaurant that has a bar I hear a little voice in my head saying "Do it, it's just one drink." When someone offers me a beer, it's literally a fight inside me that says no and when I do, I have a lingering of regret because it's only one drink. Between Thursday and Saturday I think about it. I'm afraid to go out with friends because of that feeling and knowing alcohol will be readily available. 

I want to cry because I can't go out with friends without fighting myself inside to merely say no. I keep myself inside and as far away from parties or outings just so I don't have to say no. It hurts because I'm keeping myself from so many dinners and get togethers.

Now, I'm giving in. I can't fight this alone because I'm missing parts of my life because of the urge to drink. I want help but I don't know where to start. I'm going to graduate so I won't have access to tang so I don't know where to go. What am I going to do? I want to cry because I'm trying so hard because I don't want this to be a factor that controls myself.
