Asian boy and girl who were on the 51B bus, Sunday the 10th around 9pm, I overheard your racist remark about the African American bus driver who was kindly telling folks to move to the back of the bus to make room for more people at the Telegraph/Durant stop. Your under-the-breath comment,"Isn't it funny that he's the one telling us this [to go to the back of the bus]" was rude, racist, and absolutely unnecessary. - From that white girl who was standing right next to you.
