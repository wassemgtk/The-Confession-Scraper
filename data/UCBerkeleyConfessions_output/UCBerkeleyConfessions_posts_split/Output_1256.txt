ly really really like this guy. He seems like such a great catch but there is one issue..he keeps giving me mixed signals. He will constantly be in touch with me, flirt with me for 24 hours straight on text and then he will vanish in thin air. No texts, nothing for another week until I text him. He behaves very casually when we start talking again, as if we never stopped in the first place. He says he's been really busy.

I don't know if he likes me or not. I don't know what's going on. I don't know what to do.
