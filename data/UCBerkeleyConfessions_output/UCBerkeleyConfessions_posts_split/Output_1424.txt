handsome Hispanic guy who walks through Piedmont in the mornings and lives in the house between ACACIA and KKG … let me tell you something! I first saw you eating at the International House and fell in love instantly. I want to talk to you badly, but you seem to be calm and silent (this makes you even more attractive). My friend told me she sees you every Monday because both of you are part of ASUC … why can't that be me?!  We crossed each other's path today and you smiled at me ... I wanted to pull you from your scarf and kiss you for minutes! I will stop being the stupid girl who pretends to like frat boys and start digging you. Next time you see me, talk to me!
