n International student from a developing country in Asia, and the previous posts about majors have made me decided to type this post.  Coming from a country where poor people are really poor and rich people are very rich, I am aware of how privileged I am.  Both my parents are very racist people, and so living at home, seeing how cruel they treated the maids, while being so nice to me was really a torture.  Three years ago, when I got into Cal’s College of Engineering, they were extremely happy, and had already plan out my entire future after graduating from Cal for me.  I have always been a pretty good student at STEM, but in my high school, almost every student is very good at math and science, I know I am just lucky plus my parents are one of the few that can support their children to study abroad.  

Sorry, let me go straight to my point.  Freshman year in Cal was really relaxing, the classes for my major weren’t really that challenging but fun.  I was so sure that I would probably just double in EECS/MSE, as my parents wanted me to, until I took a non-major lower div class in my sophomore year – Development Studies 10 with Professor Michael Watts.  Professor Watts’ lectures were so inspiring, that even though I got my first B at Cal from that class (as you can probably tell, my English is terrible, can’t really speak in discussion, plus I have really bad essay writing skill), I started to have this “terrible” idea of switching major.  To all the native speakers in that class, it must be an easy A, not because the materials were easy, but Professor was kind enough to make most of the readings optional, so if you were taking the class just for requirements, you could have good grade without studying too hard, but if you are serious into help making the world become a better place, optional readings help you to understand a lot of deeper about how inequalities in different part of the world were build up and grow.  

After a year of internal struggling, I am now double majoring in Development Studies & Political Science, with terrible GPA, cause I still speak little to none during discussion sections and write terrible essays.  The worst thing is, I still don’t have the courage to tell my parents that I actually switched college and majors to the “useless ones”, and I’m not planning to tell them until I graduate, once thing is done, it’s done.  All my friends think that’s a terrible decision that I made, and yes, I kind of agree.  I don’t know why I am choosing the majors that most people would consider easier than my previous majors, and even worse when I am actually super bad at doing readings, writing and speaking in English (we should just study what we are best at, isn’t it?).  The thing is, there are so many talented and smart people in the STEM fields already (at least in my country, since in many developing countries, that is one of the few ways to become wealthy - doctor/lawyer/engineer, choose one), when there are so little educated people who care enough to solve the government corruption problems and fight and speak for the bottom billion. 

 I don’t know how to conclude my thought, so let me just type my last few sentences…  I found it sad and funny the same time that people are arguing about which majors are more superior to the others.  Your parents did not give you that smart brain to just show off on facebook and look down at others.  If you are that smart, good for you for having the opportunity to find out how talented you are instead of fighting starvation throughout your childhood.  If you are that such, don’t you think it would be such a waste if you don’t try to make a good and huge impact on this planet instead of just use your super intelligent brain as a show off object?  Can we just all think less about individual success and more about human beings/ mother nature’s future as a whole? Thanks for reading, and hope you understand my Engrish.
