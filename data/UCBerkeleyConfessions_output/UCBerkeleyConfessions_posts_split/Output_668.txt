a fetish for soiled and dirty panties - the scents absolutely drive me wild. Not exactly the most socially acceptable fetish, I know, and as you'd imagine, it's incredibly difficult to get ahold of these without stealing them from the laundry room or something (which I don't do). I've gotten a lot of shit in the past by my exes for being a perv and creep for this, but I don't think girls realize that I'd actually pay 20-30 bucks just to do their dirty laundry for them. (;
