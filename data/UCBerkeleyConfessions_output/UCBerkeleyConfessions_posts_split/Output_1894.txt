gay  male. Well, I am not sure whether I am gay or bi, but the issue is that there is this boy who I really like. We met a few months back in the dining commons and we have barely exchange words. We had two classes last year and my observations of him indicate that he is a good guy. If I could date him that would be great, but from what I know he is straight, so I would love to at least be his friend. How can I build up enough courage to say hi without looking like a freak? Thanks.
