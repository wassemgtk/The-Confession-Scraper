irl who was sitting in the grass by Wheeler (the hill across from Dwinelle that people sit on sometimes), looking sad around 2pm today:

Sorry I didn't walk over and ask you what was wrong, I had a class to get to. I did try to get your attention, to see if a smile would cheer you up, but whatever it was must have been really bothering you and you didn't notice. Did you break up with your boyfriend? Fail a midterm? Whatever it is, hope you feel better. Everyone goes through tough times in college, things will get better.
