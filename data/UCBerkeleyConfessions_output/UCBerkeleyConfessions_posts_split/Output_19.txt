mmate's in the reserves and when he's gone for his one weekend a month I like to go around picking up chicks, getting meals paid for me and have people "thank me for my service". If I'm running on E I just stop by at the gas station, tell someone I forgot my wallet and get filled up. If I really want to up the ante, I just bust out the wheelchair, and if I'm really feeling ballsy I pin on that purple heart I bought on ebay. Don't judge.
