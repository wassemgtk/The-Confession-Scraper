diagnosed with PTSD a few years ago. Luckily, the only so-called 'triggers' I have are fairly specific sets of circumstances, and I don't encounter them often. Except, last week, my professor assigned us a novel that discusses said circumstances in great detail. Somehow I managed to finish reading the book, but I'm not sure I'll be able to talk about it in class publicly, much less write academically about it. What do I do?
