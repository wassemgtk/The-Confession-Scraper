is absolutely terrifying.

I was thinking today about the family I've constructed on my floor, and how I feel so surrounded by friends. In a year though, this whole community is going to be shattered. We get used to living with these people so closely: we live together, eat together, party together, socialize together, study together, all of it. But it only lasts for less than a year, and then we're all thrown to new places.

It feels like as I get older, fewer things are constant. People come in and out of my life for shorter and shorter times. I can honestly admit that I miss the consistency of the social atmosphere of high school.
