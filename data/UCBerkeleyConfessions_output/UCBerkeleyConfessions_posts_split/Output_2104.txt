o school in the East Coast, but my ex goes to Berkeley. We broke up a year ago because of the distance. Recently you told me you were involved with some other guy, so I told you I was interested in some girl here. That was the first lie I ever told you. Of course I couldn't love another girl after what we shared. I've never been as sure about anything as I was about us. I only brought up the other girl because I know I've been holding you back from meeting someone new, and I want you to move on. I guess it worked, since now you refuse to talk to me... 

I really do hope you find love again, even if I never do.
