a black girlfriend and I'm scared of bringing her home or ever telling my parents about her (they're traditional asian as you can see...). We've been together for a while but as senior year is coming to an end here, I really want to do something big to show that not only I accept her, but my parents will too (too bad its nigh impossible for now). Any help guys? Anyone been in a similar situation?
