ing to my shallow-as-fuck floormates talk about all the guys they've hooked up with and all the guys that follow them around like lovesick puppies is killing my ego. Every time I wake up to them talking about some new guy who is in love with them is just another slap in the face and another blow to my already damaged heart.
