guy who was wearing the Born Ruffians -"birthmarks" album- t shirt and white headphones that i stopped to compliment, i was actually listening to Oceans Deep when i saw you.. I wish i hadnt been running late for my 1 o clock lecture to at least have asked for your name.. Crossing my fingers you see this confession or i see you again :)
