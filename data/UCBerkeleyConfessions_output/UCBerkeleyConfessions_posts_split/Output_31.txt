sexual in a social fraternity, but I don't feel comfortable coming out to anyone, even though there are other gay people in my fraternity too. It's easy to hide. Bisexuality is so misunderstood, as some transitional phase between homosexuality and heterosexuality, like it doesn't really exist. Whenever people want to talk about girls, I can do that because I'm actually interested in them, and people will think I'm straight. But sometimes, I just want to talk about (and casually hook up with?) guys too. Who would I be able to talk to about this? Do you think my girlfriend would be down?
