gh we have only been here for two months, I know that I have fallen for you.  I won't confess my true feelings on a facebook page because I'd rather do that in person, but I just want to say thank you to the housing gods for letting us end up at the same place at the same time. By chance, we wound up living a few doors away from each other.  Since moving in, not a day has gone by where we haven't seen each other.  When friends and family ask how college is going, I say I love it and I know that the majority of my happiness comes from getting to know you.  Thank you, fate, for bringing me to this girl.
