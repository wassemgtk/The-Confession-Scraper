t, sushant, sushant gadgil. You have captivated me with your smile and your eyes the very first day we met. It's a blessing to have you at ucb, and I'm just hoping you're single. You're truly the kindest person I've ever met, but I know there's no hope for me since many girls feel this way about you. Whoever you decide to choose, I'll always support you 100%, because I know that whomever you choose deserves you. Thanks for being a great person, and I'm eager to see where we lead.
