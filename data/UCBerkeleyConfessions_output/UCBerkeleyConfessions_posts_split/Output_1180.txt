ly want to do something about everything going on with Tele-Bears. It feels like none of us are getting the classes we need, and all the big lectures are already getting full way too early. It doesn't seem fair that one's enrollment can be so drastically affected by the randomness of the system.

I don't know what I would do though. I really just want things to change.
