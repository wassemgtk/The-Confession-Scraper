t know her name but that girl with the nose piercing who works at the cash register at Ramona's is so awesome! I bet she hears it a lot (or I hope she does), but she is really nice and friendly and always asks "how's it going?", but never slows down the line people. Working at the cash register at a Cal Dining's location is probably not the best job or kind of boring, so I totally understand when the staff is not overly excited about ringing up your panini. But whenever I see this girl all friendly and smiley, it totally brightens my day. Thank you!!
