ss the other day I was talking to this girl who casually mentioned this awesome charity organization that she came up with and founded in high school, and for some reason it gave me this overwhelming feeling of gratitude. Every single one of our peers worked his or her ass off and did amazing things to get here. Our football team may suck, and we may be miserable and studying while our friends at other schools are partying every day of the week, but the people we go to class with and struggle with and drink shitty vodka with are all seriously dedicated, motivated, intellectually stimulating and amazing people, and I wouldn't trade it for anything in the world.
