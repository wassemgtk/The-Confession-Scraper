this cute girl from Anthropology class and I asked her out. I used my Chicago Aura and we dated once, but then I realized she wasn't the one for me. I didn't want to hurt her so I made excuses to stay away from her like, "I'm sick." or "I gotta study". I also ignored her texts and calls. A week later she saw me at a party and got really pissed at me. Now she wants me to apologize? What should I do? She's such a b*tch.
