midsts of all these sexist, racist, fucked up, rants- I gotta say....from someone studying abroad as an ES major; the bullshit womxn and POC deal with here is nothing compared to the stuff other people in even other first world countries like Japan (which I'm residing in right now) have to deal with. But unlike other mean spirited people will say, I think my fellow womxn and POC should really try harder to do something about this instead of pretend they are okay with such inequality because it may not seem like a big deal in the states but once you move out, it becomes a big deal. And for you white males who think it's not your problem well...fuck you. So many of you need a privilege check...
