emester, my bestfriend has spent all of her time getting high. She has become a completely different person and its no longer fun being around her when she's always super baked.  I hold nothing against people who smoke, I smoke myself occasionally. I dont know how to talk to her about it. I dont know if I should or if I should let her come to the realization on her own.
