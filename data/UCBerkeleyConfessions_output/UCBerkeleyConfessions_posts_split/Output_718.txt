ey students are HORRIBLE at complying to street signs. EVERY STUDENT jaywalks without even looking around to see if there are cars coming HONKING AT YOU (not to mention that they don't even notice the stop sign). It makes BAD reputations of Cal students. So PLEASE don't jaywalk as if it were your "thing" to do in your life. If you're going to do it, AT LEAST look around to see if there are cars coming.
