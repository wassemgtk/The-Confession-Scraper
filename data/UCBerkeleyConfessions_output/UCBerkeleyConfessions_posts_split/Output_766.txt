out to all UC Berkeley janitors: Thank you and bless your souls for cleaning the bathroom. I imagine it's a horribly filthy job -- taking care of college students. Whenever I see my janitor in the morning, I make a point to say hello and ask her how she's doing. It warms my heart to see others on my floor uphold this act of common courtesy as well. So please, be sure to say a simple hello or do do something nice. You never know the impact a small gesture can make. :)
