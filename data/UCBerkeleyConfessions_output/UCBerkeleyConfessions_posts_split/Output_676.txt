who go into other floors' lounges and start talking when everyone else there is working...shut the fuck up. We pay a lot of money to use these lounges and if all you're going to do is talk about your stupid relationship and your deeeeeeeep thoughts about yourself, please do that outside. You've been talking for literally an hour straight. Shut. The. Fuck. Up.
