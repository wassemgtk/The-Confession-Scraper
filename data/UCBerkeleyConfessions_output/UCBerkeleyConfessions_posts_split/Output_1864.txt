when people take this school for granted. Please be pumped that your at UC Berkeley, a school that kids dream of getting in to. If you dont like it here please leave! Please open a spot for a kid that has his heart set on getting in to this school. Some one that is going to rep Cal and be proud. Its the freaking no 1 school. Most of you have never been to a different college but cal in almost every way beats other schools. So if you can bleed blue then dont walk the halls of this time tested UC, thats fine but stop trying to convince me that we could be "better" be happy and thankful you have such a great opportunity.
