I came home after work to an entire 3 pound bag of sunflower seeds strewn all over my floor by my dog. I got so mad that I yelled at her and made her feel really guilty and sad. And then I got sad by extension and fed her a treat. I feel like I'm reinforcing bad behavior every time I give her a treat after an incident like this but I just get too upset when my dog is sad. I'm seeking advice on this incident.
