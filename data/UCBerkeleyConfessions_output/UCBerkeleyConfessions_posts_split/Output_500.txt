end and I were eating at the dinning commons when we heard some people talk about some guy who was eating by himself. They said "Look at him what a loner, who eats by the themselves".

I just want to say that there is nothing wrong with eating by yourself. People are so judgemental to people they don't even know. Don't judge please, lets try to make this a better place.
