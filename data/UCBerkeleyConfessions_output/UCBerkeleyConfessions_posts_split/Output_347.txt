mmate talks to her damn boyfriend on the phone every fucking morning at like 7 am. I understand you miss him and blah blah blah, but have some fucking respect for those who are trying to sleep. I don't give a shit that you "miss him," grow the fuck up and stop acting like this is high school where you HAVE to talk to him or you'll like die or something.
