in the Soda Computer Lab (the dungeon) and here's a message to those who use the computers: We would greatly appreciate it if you act more like college level students and clean up after yourself. It had always been the dirtiest area at the end of the day (scrap paper, food wraps, used bandage,...) and I thought it really crossed the line this week. Yesterday I had to hand pick a bunch of cereals from the carpet and today it's popsicle sticks, sun flower seeds and chewing gum. (Really, good fucking job whoever it was that decided splitting gum on the ground was a good idea!) We already let you guys get away with eating in the lobby so at least have some respect and don't turn it into a dining area."
