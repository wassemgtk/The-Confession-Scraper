are objectively awesome. How else do you explain that, despite the fact that we faced much racism and discrimination in our early days of coming to the US, that we STILL managed to beat White people at their own game?
Look at this university. Look at how many of us are Asian. Do you think that is any accident? Many of us came from poorer homes and faced obstacles such as language barriers. The first wave of Asian immigrants was primarily Chinese labor workers, similar to the plight of Spanish speaking immigrants today. The only difference is that we actually managed to outperform the dominant race (Whites) at almost everything that matters. We have the lowest dropout rate of high school and college, we have the lowest teen pregnancy rate, we make up the smallest percentage of the prison population, we have the highest level of education, we have the highest median income, we are the healthiest ethnic group, we have the highest percentage of married households ... do I need to go on?

One thing that still confuses me is why I still hear people cry about White privilege. Lol. Anyone who is paying attention knows that being Asian is a much sweeter deal than being White right now for all the reasons I named above. If you believe anything to the contrary, you're being duped.
