rgot to close out the windows from my computer after you borrowed it. I know your secret, by accident and it's okay. I promise to hold it close to my heart, even from you. When you say you're going to be late, I know where you're coming from so I promise to never complain again. When you forget to bring your wallet, I won't mind paying for you. When we talk about classes, I won't bring up course subjects. I'm going to keep being regular me but an understanding me. When people bring the topic up, I'm going to defend you even when you think it's not about you I'm talking about. I'm going to protect your secret from others until you're ready even if you're never ready.

I'm going to stand beside you when you don't think no one is there.
