a small penis. it really makes sex terrible. do people care about dick size? because i do. I know i shouldn't. but fuck its just so small... FIVE INCHES is just so fucking small. its so unfortunate because i have the ability to have girls have sex with me hours after they meet me, but when i have sex they just lay there.. physically and emotionally unresponsive.. as if they don't feel my cock impacting them at all. i just wish someone  knew how terrible this was :( 
ALL IN ALL: DOES IT MATTER? .... please don't give me the bullshit answer "it's all about how you feel about the person".... because while you may feel a certain way about someone.. YOU ALSO FEEL HIS DICK DURING INTERCOURSE
