ION CAL STUDENTS,
Lighten up.  Don't take stuff so seriously and get worked up over everything.  Chill.  Life is short. You are going to wake up one day in your mid forties with a mortgage and realize you wasted your college years thinking too much about your future and petty stuff.  Enjoy life and don't get so stressed out and bitter.
