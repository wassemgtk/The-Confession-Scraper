ow, I'm sick and tired of people bashing on specific majors. I'm sorry, not everyone has Asian parents that want them to be a goddamn engineer or doctor. If someone wants to major in sociology, good for them. If someone wants to major in urban studies, good for them. And if someone wants to major in ANTHRO, good for them. People need to realize that this is UC BERKELEY. Contrary to peoples' beliefs, there is no "easy major." Every major is hard and challenging. Get off your high horse.
