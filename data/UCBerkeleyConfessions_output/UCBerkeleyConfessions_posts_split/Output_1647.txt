t even black, but it's pretty fucking weird that we live in the Bay Area, a historically black populated location (featuring cities such as Oakland and Richmond, and districts like the Filmore and Hunters Point) and yet the so called #1 Public University has one of the lowest African American and Black populations in the higher education system. What that means, I have no clue, but it's very odd.

Look at the stats if you don't believe me. Again, what that means takes a lot of study and I'm not claiming nor denying racism. Neither is this an attack on the African American or Black population. Just from my view point, it seems very interesting.
