Mota, you are the light of every conversation and gathering. I love the way you try to include everyone into the conversation... It shows how much you truly care about people. You're so humble and so TRULY beautiful and I hope you know that. I get the feeling that you're a little self conscious. Don't be. Your smile and your beautiful blue eyes can light up a room. Hands down, you're one of the most genuine people at Cal.
