g this off my chest... I'm a fairly average looking dude, and NOBODY would guess from looking at me, but I smoke A LOT of weed. I'm not saying this to brag, but I'm sure that if there was a bong rip competion in Berkeley, I would win.

You know when people joke around saying "smoke weed all day, er'day?" Where I'm from and the culture I'm accustomed to, that's not even a joke. For this entire semester I was high in class. I could count the days I wasn't high on my fingers. I started my morning with a milky bowl of tobacco and herb (called a moch, fiddy, bloop, popper, mole, toaster, whatever you like to call it. If you have no tolerance to weed or tobacco, one of these would absolutely fuck you up. We used to call them comatoasters because your first one will flood your brain with pleasureable chemicals and you literally lose conciousness for a minute from the overload of pleasure, like being bathed in warm, profound vibrations. But I don't stop there, because due to the law of diminishing returns I never feel satisfied anymore. It's not like "OMG i can't go a day without taking a bong rip" it's more like "hmmm yes a few more and then I'll do _____." I would have two or three or more rips before I go to my 11 am, which has  and then spend the whole day feeling anxious and afraid of speaking to others because of my cracking voice and lack of social motivation. I never counted rips. Couldn't. I would lose track. I'm saying I would average around 20 a day, and that's a weekday.

 I'm not trying to brag, I'm being honest about how shitty my situation is. I'm saying this because, I'm the kind of person that took it too far, and I am suffering socially because of it. Like I could care less what you do with your life, but you've go to understand, there ARE people like this, and we walk among you.

 I'm not trying to brag, I'm being honest about how shitty my situation is. That's why I got rid of all my stuff. But you all should understand that for this semester, I felt like I was in a different universe than the rest of the Berkeley community because I am literally a recluse. I'm sick of feeling alienated and abject. To me, this means garnering the strength to stop. I'm fucking done smoking weed. I'm fucking done smoking weed. I can affirm that I know more about being high than any one of the braindeads that are laughing at me right now for quitting a "harmless drug," so I'm gonna let you do what you do, but for me, I'm retiring. Expert gone rogue. I'm fucking done.
