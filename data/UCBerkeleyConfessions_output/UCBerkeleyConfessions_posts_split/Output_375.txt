erson who asked FOUR QUESTIONS during today's (11/15) 11am chem lecture:

Was it REALLY necessary for you to interrupt the professor FOUR TIMES during lecture? Because of that, he couldn't get through all the lecture slides, and everyone was super rude leaving while he was finishing. The lecture is not your private instruction, it is education for ~500 people. Please realize that you are producing a negative externality for the rest of us when you can, like everyone else, go to office hours.

Sincerely,

Someone Who Does Not Like You Hogging The Lecture.
