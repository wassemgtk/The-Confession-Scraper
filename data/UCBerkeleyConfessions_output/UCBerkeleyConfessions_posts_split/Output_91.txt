lly annoys me when people complain about homeless people. For some reason people think homeless people enjoy being homeless and/or that they are lazy bums. What annoys me even more though is how some people think that it's easy for homeless people to get a minimum wage job. Well it's not. With no residence, no cellphone to be contacted by, dirty clothes and bad smell...you are not gonna be hired everywhere. My father was homeless at one point in his life and it took him years to get back on his feet. Next time you talk about the homeless issue..look for solutions and not useless criticism. Hiding them somewhere away from your sight will not make a difference....other than suppress your conscious.
