Berkeley. I grew up poor, and with so many disadvantages (does that word even hold any value anymore), they would make your heartache, luckily mine doesn't anymore. 

Berkeley, has opened me to a world where I interact with the rich, the 'cultured', the 'well-traveled' I even fucked a Stanford professor the other day, instead of a dead-beat gangster back in my hometown. and unlike that rich girl/guy from previous posts I AM NOT EATING RAMEN ANYMORE! 

What I am really trying to say is thank you Berkeley for the opportunity to find value in myself. This goes to that asshole from previous posts, I feel sorry for you, you must be under so much stress, your psyche is fucked, you must be so confused but appear to have it together because of your 'major' hope you find peace. 

Chican@/ or any other major that ends in studies - keep going, I am sure you are finding value in your education. 

In conclusion, thank you, thank you thank you. God bless the UC and God bless the people surviving their struggles everyday. THANK YOU.
