ever had a boyfriend. I'm so tried of hearing "you're pretty, you're great, but". I started seeing this wonderful guy, but he ended things. I'm at the point where I'm so freaking done with being single, but I've also afraid of trying to pursue something because I don't want to hear "you're great, but". I don't know how to get attention from guys with having hook-ups. I don't want more hook-ups, I want to date someone.
