alf African-American/half Chicana, lesbian, transgendered, handicapable person of size who was adopted by Native American vegan red-headed Jews and converted to Islam, I find it extremely racist/sexist/homophobic/sizeist/anti-Semitic/carnivoristic/anti-redhead/anti-Islamic that my struggles as the ultimate minority continue to be ignored by this administration run by old, conservative, rich, heterosexual, cisgendered, privilege white Protestant males! I DEMAND that there be a new department made to study the struggles of MY people! Help me start the new Afrikan/Chican@/LGBT/Disabled/Fat Acceptance/Native American/Jewish/Vegan/Redhead/Islamic Studies Department and end this injustice that has oppressed my people for far too long! SI SE PUEDE, !click !click!
