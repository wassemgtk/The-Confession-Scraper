se people with their hands full who I failed to hold the door open for Tuesday morning when I was exiting the dorm building: I'm so sorry! I didn't see that you guys were carrying things and I was in such a rush! I hope you can tell how sorry I am because of the fact that I'm apologizing for this on an anonymous confession page.. Forgive me please.
