t one beautiful Girl at Sigma Chi...I think you are in DG. As I was playing country music you kept blowing kisses and looking my way, saying how much you loved my music selection. You were there pretty much the whole 6 hours I was playing music. I wish I could've taken a break to dance with you to your favorite song, but it's a little hard when you need to get the next song cued up for that dance floor.  Anyways you seemed like such a sweet girl and one with good taste ;). Its hard to get my attention when I am playing music but you sure did...I hope we meet again :)
