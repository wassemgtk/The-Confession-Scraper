EECS major, it really pisses me off when all those bullshit poli sci/english/racial studies majors complain about how hard their classes are. Like really, shut the fuck up. Us EECS majors, along with the rest of the engineers and science majors at Berkeley, take your shitty humanities classes as a grade booster. Honestly, I don't get why they would think those classes are hard, because quite frankly, those classes are all a joke.
