some legitimate and serious mental help.
One of my dearest and sincere friends has helped me realize that I am my own enemy.
When persuing the change one wants in life, the first step is to act upon it.
But I find myself completely unable to get past step one. 
My fear and anxiety of reprocussions and negative impacts freeze me in my path.
People like to point out that we only live once, so that we should take any chance regardless. All that supportive talk never gets into my head.
I feel as if every piece of helpful advice ever given could be represented as the best armor-penetrating bullet in the world, but it will never crack past my 100% damage/bullet-proof skull.
And every day, the more I even have the slightest though about my future, the more I think about the worst that could happen to me. 
Somehow, my mind switches into complete pessimist mode. (And no, Im dont cut my wrists or physically harm meself.)
What is also really hard to cope with is living up to the reputation that I never asked for. All the false hope that I was given back in highschool from all my supportive peers, and all the supportive families back home, it all amounts to nothing when I can't even fathom the idea of making someone out of myself. 
These problems of mine have only started to affect me when I started college last fall. I entered Berkeley believing that I would succeed in my intended major, only to find out how I couldnt keep up with the workload.
My father, who lately has been abusing his meds due to his surgery from years ago, has become a dictator. Every day I feel suppressed by his existance. 
So my failure to keep up in the prerequiste courses of my former inspiration, along with a dad-turned-madman and my mental conflicts, I cannot move on with my life. I can't even confront my parents about how I feel.
My dad will just go Mao-mode, and my mom will probably fall into depression. And I realized how horrible I've treated my mom in the past, so I do not want to make her life worse now by telling her I no longer want to persue my former dream. I know they want the best for me, to find a job and live, but I know I will never be happy with that path. 
Yet at the end of the day? It comes back to the beginning: I can't act upon it. Well, I am capable of doing it, but I am incapable of pushing myself to do it. My mindset has been so deformed that I am no longer able to be independent. 
At the eve of every day, I tell myself to take the easy way out. I know the default argument is: "What about all of those people who care about you?" and I completely understand it. I know it is selfish of me to even consider it, but I feel like everyone has their boundaires. I feel justified to say I just cannot handle all of this anymore. 

But at the end of the day, I find myself still living and continue to make my life a living hell.
P.S. To my friend who knows about all this, if you are reading this, please don't put me on blast. This is meant to be anonymous.
