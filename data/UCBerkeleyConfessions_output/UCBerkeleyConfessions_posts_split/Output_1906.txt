t wait to walk through Sproul Plaza and shoot a dirty look at all of you bullshit student groups who only use race as the main focus of the group. You disgust me. We are supposed to integrate with each other, not clique up with those we only feel comfortable with. And if I see another god damn club with another Asian variation I'm going to scream.
