ends from back home came to visit me this past weekend. They were curious to see what the guys looked like out here, keeping an eye out for hot athletes, frat boys, or maybe an extremely rare, HOT Asian guy that looks like Dennis Joseph O'Neil, Arjun Rampal, or Julien Kang (unfortunately, I haven't seen any so far)

And as normal, sane, straight girls do, we went out all day and partied all night, and goddamn there were no men, NO MEN that could quench our thirst. I even pointed out some of the guys that I thought were (barely) cute, and my girls gave me the reality check that I desperately needed... they saved me from sleeping with a sleazy 3 or 5/10, which I'm sure I would have totally regretted and I would throw up a little bit if I ever thought of it (or the hideous guy)..

Morale of the story? BERKELEY GOGGLES ARE REAL, GO OUT INTO THE REAL WORLD TO FIND SOME DECENT LOOKING HUMAN BEINGS

Athletes are still good to fuck tho
