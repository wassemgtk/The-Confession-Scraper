ave really liked my friend since we were juniors in high school and now we are both juniors in college. I fell for him the moment that I saw him. We have remained great friends throughout the years we consider ourselves to be best friends. Every time that we are near each other we flirt, we hug, we kiss each other (on the cheek), and its obvious that we are attracted to one another. In a couple weeks we will be going out together just him and me. I really want to tell him how I feel about him and ask him how he feels about me because I have a feeling that he is equally attracted to me. I just do not know how to tell him because I am afraid of our relationship falling apart, but I cannot take it anymore I have to confess my feelings. Please someone help me out. Should I tell him straight up or should I write him a letter (like I was planning on doing)Please HELP me out!
