girl in the burgundy pants who was drawing a portrait of John Lennon in the Unit 1 courtyard tonight with her earbuds in. You are SO TALENTED. I wanted to strike up conversation with you but you looked so into your art and music that I didn't want to bother you. What is your name?! I'd love to take you out someday.
