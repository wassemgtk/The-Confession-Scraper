guy at Rochdale Village that was arguing with his cheating (I hope EX) girlfriend: your (sexy ass) voice woke me up after having pulled an all nighter, but instead of being mad what I heard made me happy and proud of your existence. I can't imagine what you were feeling, but I had never heard anyone be so eloquent and calm while dealing with a situation like that. I hope you left that girl. She doesn't deserve you at all. I still hear you out there. Tell her to shove the spoon she just threw at you up her ass. (I really wish you would say her name! Lol)
