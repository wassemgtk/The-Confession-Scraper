I knew how to sing, that way I can sing a love song to a girl that catches my eye. I mean, I know how to talk to girls, but this way I can take her breath away. Girls deserve the world, and should be given the love and respect they deserve. Shout out to all the lovely ladies, much love for all of ya'll.

sincerely, 
the mysterious Mexican student
