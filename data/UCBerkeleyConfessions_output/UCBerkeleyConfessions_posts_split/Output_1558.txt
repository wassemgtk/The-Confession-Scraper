7 years broke up with me. She's happy and found another guy and I'm "happy" for her. I want to continue to have a good time and stop crying and show her what she will be missing out on. Any women out there want to go out on dates and talk and get to know a friendly, outgoing, and loyal guy. (She got the commitment scare about getting married when she was the one that brought it up and I asked her father for permission. We received his blessings and she bounces like 2 months later (1 week after our 7 year anniversary. Can guarantee size and sex wasny a problem)
