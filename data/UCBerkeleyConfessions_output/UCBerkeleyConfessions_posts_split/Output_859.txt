ve such an amazing personality, we play around like we've known each other for such a long time and you're just gorgeous. I look forward to coming back from such a long day of class and just seeing you down the hall. The only problem is that we live on the same floor and you have a boyfriend...who goes to UCLA. I secretly wait for the day that you come knocking on my door telling me that you've broken up. Am I really that horrible?
