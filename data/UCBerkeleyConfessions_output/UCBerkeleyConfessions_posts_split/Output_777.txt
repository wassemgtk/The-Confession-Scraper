to a fist fight with a feminist today. 

at school today, in front of sproul. A group of feminists were protesting about equality and crap like that.

They said, to repay for years of inequality, 20% of all male's earnings should go towards women. Dead serious.

They also said that women should have to pay less for food and men should have to pay more to make up for the 100's of years of inequality and that this should go on for 100's of years.

I asked the leader if she even knew what equality was and she said it's when everyone is treated equally and fairly. And I asked how the f*** is this fair? I wasn't alive 100's years of ago. I never did anything to you, why the f*** should I pay more? And she said that even though you weren't alive, you still benefit from the social prestige of being a male.

At this point I was furious, and I told her you know what else needs to be socially acceptable as equality? A man and a woman getting into a street fight. She was flabbergasted and became very irate and scolded me for even thinking of hitting a woman and how it's very disrespectful. I told her to shut her fat face up and she slapped me.

I immediately countered with a right upper cut into her gut and tore a piece of her blouse. She immediately bent over, grasping her gut in pain like Vegeta when Goku punched him in the stomach. She tried to fight back but I delivered an axe kick to the back of her head and she went down unconscious.

I really taught her what equality meant that day.
