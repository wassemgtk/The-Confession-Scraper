approached me after lecture and said that as he was grading my reading response, he noticed that it was worded very similarly to another student's response. He asked me if maybe the student and I worked together; I said no (quite frankly, I didn't even know who the student was). When I returned back to my room, I decided to pull up both of our responses, which are posted to an open forum that all class members can view (I posted my response a good seven hours before the student). After all, the topic was rather specific and the instructions called for referencing specific readings, so I wondered how similar they could be. I now understand why my GSI raised his eyebrows; you literally copied and pasted my response, thinking you were so clever by switching the last two paragraphs, inserting some quotes, and rearranging my sentences. I know who you are now, and you picked the wrong student to plagiarize. Academic dishonesty makes me sick. I hope you fail this class and/or are kicked out of Cal.
