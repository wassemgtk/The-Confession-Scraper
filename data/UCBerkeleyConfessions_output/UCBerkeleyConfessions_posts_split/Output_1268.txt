just me or does anyone else have an inferiority thing going on while attending Cal? I am a freshman and I understand I should probably give myself a mini break since I'm supposed to be in the process of adjusting and stuff, but I see so many freaking amazing people here that it's really getting to me. I bonded with my floor mates over this topic but even they don't get it because they were all valedictorians and my grade point average sucks...I'm surprised I even got in this school at all. Everyone I've met is either a fantastic dancer, debater, singer, can speak multiple languages etc. And here I am. I don't belong in this sea of amazing fish. I'm just this tiny plankton that floats in the bottom. And people are constantly telling me to find something I love. Well. I love reading and writing but that's nothing "cool." People will not "ooh" and "ah" over it. It's just hard waking up every morning knowing that there are amazing intellectuals walking this campus while I'm struggling in Chemistry 1A and Math 10A. It's really not fair.
