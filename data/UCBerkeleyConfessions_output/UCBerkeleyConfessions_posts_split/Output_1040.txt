med a table for studying in Moffett by leaving all of my study materials and my backpack on said table. Unfortunately I have a kidney infection, and had to make a restroom run shortly after the claiming of the table. When I got back, a douchebag decided to commandeer the table, even though there were plenty of other, unclaimed study spaces around my table. Even when I grabbed my backpack and all of my study materials, there was no acknowledgment of my presence and no apology for occupying my territory. Either I and all of my belongings entered an invisibility dimension, or this kid is a major douche. Moral of the story, don't be a dickwad.
