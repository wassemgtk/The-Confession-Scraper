been together for 3 years. I transferred to cal last year and he transferred this year. He told me he was attracted to men last year but still wanted to be with me. Now that he is at cal, he's joining all these gay campus groups and he still comes over and we have sex. I feel trapped because we both go to cal and I don't know how long I can take this double life. I love him but I'm stuck with his gay persona. What do I do?
