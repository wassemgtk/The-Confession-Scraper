sions of a Freshman:I have been in college for four months and it’s everything and nothing like I expected. First thing is first, I thought they would be a larger variety of cute boys and while there are some, not as many as you would expect. Friends and acquaintances are blurred into what I like to call fraintances. A combination of people who you sometimes see, sometimes say hi to or sometimes ignore, yes I know it’s confusing. Some days I feel like the only person I see consistently is my roommate. I don’t know if I have found a group of friends yet and it’s weird saying that because my phone is packed with numbers. But numbers can be deceiving, it was easier in high school to see where you belonged because you always saw your friends, college is different. I can have a two hour deep conversation with someone and then see them two weeks later, only to offer a small waive before we go our separate ways. That’s the first thing I learned, you have to build the relationships you want to have and take the time to call a friend, go out to lunch or just do something. Otherwise their name and number just become simply that, a name and number, of that person you saw that one time and their face, a blur. I guess what I am trying to say is that I am still figuring it out, I just hope I am not the only one that feels this way...
