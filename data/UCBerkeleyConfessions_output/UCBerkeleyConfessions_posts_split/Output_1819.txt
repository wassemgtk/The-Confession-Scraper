ntly there are two fobby asian guys in bowles that walk around the bathroom naked after showering, and dry themselves off after getting out of the shower. My roommates and other people on the floor have walked in on them, but i hope i never do. I know it's probably a cultural thing that they are more comfortable with nudity but don't they know how conservative Americans are about nudity? Also, it's bad enough living an all-male dorm, I don't want to see them naked.
