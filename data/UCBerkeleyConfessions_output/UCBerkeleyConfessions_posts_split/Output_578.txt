my classes and the opportunity to grow and become more educated. I just hate all the overly competitive, fake, cut throat people in them. I understand you want the highest grade possible (most of us do) but that doesn't mean you have to pretend to be flawless. This is a tough university and regardless if you have to work your butt off or it comes easy to you, you don't need to shut everyone else down. I feel so isolated sometimes
