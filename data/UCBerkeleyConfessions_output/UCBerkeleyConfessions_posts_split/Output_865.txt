ps were involved in an altercation outside my apartment on Durant. It was late at night, probably around 12 am. Two cops suddenly emerged upon the streets, bruised up and hungry for blood. As I ran to look out my window I saw crowds of people rushing out into the streets to see what was going on. What they saw were two cops ready to kill each over what appears to be a brief case. The white cop had the other black cop held up, and said he's going to collect the brief case for evidence while the black cop said he's gonna get the gun lying on the floor and then he's gonna get the money. I suspect the briefcase contains money.

The black cop truly believes the white cop won't shoot him and he'll be able to pick up the gun, get the money, and get outta there. So as the black cop advances for the gun, the white cop shoots him in his ass. The white cop means business and makes it clear that the next shot will kill the other cop. The white cop then asks the other cop if he wants to go home, the other cop says yeah, he wants his money so he could go home. The white cop takes off the black cop's badge and said he doesn't deserve to wear it.

Alarmingly, one of the crowd member's picks up the gun and points it at the black cop and says the white cop can go on and bounce. The white cop picks up the briefcase and departs from our suburban ghetto. The black cop was furious, he said he's going to put cases on everyone in the crowd, sending them to Pelican Bay under 24 hour lockdown, forcing the SHU program on them. Feeling legitimately threatened, the crowd dispersed and what was left was an injured black cop who also fled the scene.
