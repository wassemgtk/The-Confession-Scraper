rd is WAY better than Cal... The people who say otherwise are only trying to make themselves feel better for not getting into Stanford, or not applying. That's the truth. Personally I feel like I'm lying to myself when I try to convince myself that Cal is better. Everyone here is so judgmental and way too competitive about everything. It's like every man for himself. I wish I went to Stanford.
