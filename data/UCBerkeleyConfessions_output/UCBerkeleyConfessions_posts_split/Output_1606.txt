eek system seems to be full of privileged (and often ignorant) white kids who are so wrapped up in their own trivial social matters that they forget that a vast majority of the world (including the student body at cal) doesn't come from the same privileged environment. it's also funny how sorority girls love to blanket their bullshit with "community service" themes despite the obvious fact that no, spending a summer in africa does not make you a hero. no,  the non-western world is not an impoverished rathole that needs to be saved by your people. the greek community is not only superficial but self-affirming in its blindness. you motivate each other to continue your (collective and individual) ignorance and lack of perspective. please try learning more about the world around you before you set your agendas to "reform" it.
