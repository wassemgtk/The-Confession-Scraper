ne said that the Standard meal plan would be fine, including my family.

What they don't know is how typically, I can afford one meal a day and maybe a small snack, and that's being "on track." Obviously, people have it worse, but the fact that the meal points system's "standard" seems to assume that you will have a job, receive money from home, or spend your own money on food as well is very messed up to me.
