een told my whole life that I was thin and people were jealous of how thin I was.  Well after coming here I feel fat.  I still fit in the same 00 jeans I've always worn but I'm losing my natural thigh gap.  I didn't think I'd ever be obsessed with my weight but I am.  I look at some girls on my floor and they are so skinny and I start to judge my body.  I feel like people are going to judge me - when I go home, my parents always ask me if I gained weight and I'm afraid to weigh myself because I don't want to know if I broke 100.  I know it's bad and unhealthy to obsess but I can't help it.
