year ago I broke up with my ex-boyfriend. We dated for a year and a half. He was the sweetest guy I have ever met, but at the end I knew that we were very different people and I knew that we werent meant to be. I tried to break up with him in the most gentle possible way. Things turned bad, when he had a difficult time moving on. I didn't know how to help him move on - so I became the total bitch (at least I feel like I did).  

I love this guy - as a friend. I know that he is one of the best human beings and that I was lucky to date him. But also know that we just werent meant to be. 

Now, I want to apologize and I dont know how. I am waiting to collect the courage and tell him.
