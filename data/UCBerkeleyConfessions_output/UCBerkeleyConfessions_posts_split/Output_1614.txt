Look, I don't give two shits about your emotional state, your feelings or your inability to engage in social interaction. I don't think most people care that you're too beta to approach a member of the opposite sex, or that you feel estranged from your self-imposed social isolation. 

Stop whining about problems that you've caused and only you have the solution to. Contrary to popular belief, it may not always be your "fault," but the impetus is always upon you to fix it. 

Honestly, pull your fucking self together and move on with your life, or go squander your time crying on your own facebook page. I subscribed to a confessions page, not a virtual girlfriend. 

Also, fuck recycling.
