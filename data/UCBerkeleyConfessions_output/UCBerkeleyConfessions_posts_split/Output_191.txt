dude,

Yesterday, on 11-22 at about noon-ish-1ish my friends and I were standing by the table that was selling the StanfUrd shirts and as a joke I told my friend to yell out to people to buy the shirts to help our other friend out. She yelled out to you, saying, "You should buy this shirt, you'll look beautiful in it" to which you responded with a smile. You were the only person to respond in a friendly manner and to top it off you had a beautiful smile. Thanks for being friendly and flashing us a smile and on  that note I'd love to be friends :) It's nice seeing friendly people on campus. <- take note Cal kids!
