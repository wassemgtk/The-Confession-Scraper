Berkeley is a public school and the amount of money you spend to go here is affordable compared to private schools...but when I look around no one is close to my financial situation. My parents are scraping by and one is unemployed. My parent contribution is zero dollars because they don't have anything to contribute. I look around and people are spending on this and that. I barely have money for books and food while these kids are bragging about their designer bags... I've never felt poor but here I do.
