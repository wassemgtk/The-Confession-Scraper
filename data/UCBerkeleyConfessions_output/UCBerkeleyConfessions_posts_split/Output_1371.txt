to eat toilet paper. The two ply kind because I like to tear a square off and pull them apart. Then I like to rip it into smaller pieces and eat them. I don't know why, the taste is not delicious, it's just comforting especially when I close my eyes and the room is quiet. I carry a little zip lock baggy with some strips in it and whenever I get anxious in class, I excuse myself to the bathroom and eat 1-2 strips in the bathroom stall then I feel better. I always get nervous when I look into my bag and it's not there so I have to go home and get it before I do anything else. No one knows this, not even my parents.
