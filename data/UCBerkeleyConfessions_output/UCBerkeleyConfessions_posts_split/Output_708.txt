mes I feel so overwhelmed with work and swamped by a persistent workload that I want to chuck it down the drain, go back home, curl up in bed and watch Netflix. However upon returning to Berkeley after a wonderful three day weekend spent with at home, I see how privileged I am to be here. Yes, we are all up to our throats in work but this is why Berkeley has maintained such a premiere reputation. Why else would it be ranked as the number one public university in the world if students didn't work hard and *suffer*? So to all my fellow Berkelians, please hang on. It's hard and as a freshman entering one of the most dreaded majors here, I'm feeling the impact big time. But please just keep on going. Imagine the sheer pleasure of graduation and telling people that you are forever repping blue and gold. Whenever you hear the fight song remember how hard you fought to achieve success in a school where succeeding is bittersweet. You got into Berkeley for a reason; never doubt why you are here. The admission officers saw you were a promising candidate and because of that you were admitted and another student were turned away. Hang on you bears<3
