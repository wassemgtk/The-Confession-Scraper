at the guy who goes out in front of the foothill La Loma gate to talk on his blue flip phone and spins that shiny metal bar in the other hand. seriously, you make it look so easy, but why the heck do you always carry it? you look so chill and not going to lie, you're kind of awesome :). anyone know who this boy is?
