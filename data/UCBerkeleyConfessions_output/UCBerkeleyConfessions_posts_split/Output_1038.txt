een so desperate for food lately that I've resorted to eating squirrels. Now I can't walk to class without having my mouth water every time one of those delicious critters scurries by. I was ashamed of my actions at first but goddamn they're amazing. You take one home, throw it in a pot, add some broth, a potato, baby you've got a stew going!
