bi guy, but I wish I was full-on gay sometimes because the process of trying to have sex with a female is quite troublesome and tiring, especially compared to the process of pulling a cute guy. It's really frustrating having to put in so much effort to get a girl only to have it go to waste. Why can't girls just be as easy as guys? ugh why do I also have to be attracted to girls?
