random guy in the green shirt who snatched my green to-go box filled with food and threw it on the ground near the CKC dinning common for no reason, you're a complete asshole. Were you trying to look cool for all your other tall, better-looking-than-you friends? Because your short, ugly ass looked like it didn't belong there. I hope I never see your alien looking face again. You're lucky I was tired and had a fever because even though I'm a girl, I'm sure I could've beaten up your tiny ass.
