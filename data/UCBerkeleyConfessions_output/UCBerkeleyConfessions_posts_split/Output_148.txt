warning to people who walk past Dwinelle/Wheeler/and other halls in that proximity at night.. please be careful.
Last night, I was walking back to Bowles, and I saw 3-4 people next to this black Subaru, and they kept flashing their headlights at me. I was confused and didn't really know what to do..I started walking a little bit more quickly until one of them (tall, in-shape??, 20ish years old) started approaching me briskly. Being the dumbass I am, I stopped and asked the guy what he needed. His buddy came charging at me with a bat and looked like he was going to fucking swing me. Luckily, I pulled the bat away, gave the guy a right hook and Zab Judah legs.. and his friends ran back in the car and drove off quickly..
I looked at the unconscious body...and I tried looking for a driver's license. Nothing. A Cal Card? Nope. He was completely clean of any form of ID. I called my roommates and they laughed at me and didn't believe me..so the last thing I did was call my mom. After I told her the story, she started bawling on me and got scared and said, “You’re movin’ with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air.” I whistled for a cab and when it came near The license plate said fresh and it had dice in the mirror If anything I could say that this cab was rare But I thought, “Nah, forget it. Yo home to Bel-Air!” I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8 And I yelled to the cabby yo holmes smell ya later Looked at my kingdom I was finally there To sit on my throne as the prince of Bel-Air
