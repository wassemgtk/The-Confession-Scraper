e please explain to me how relationships even start off. Yes, I understand that a reciprocation of shared "liking" has to happen but what are the EFFING ODDS that someone likes you back. Like holy shit, wtf is that. I mean let's get real, I'm an 18 year old girl who everyone says has an amazing body and a confident self-esteem, and such and such. But I've never had a boyfriend, like it's getting to the point where I don't think I'll ever have one. F that if you say, it's probably not the right time and la-di-da bullshit. Honestly, I need to tape a boyfriend application on my backpack and walk around campus. That'll probably increase my probabilities. Ahh, but how nice would it be if I a guy would just LIKE ME. like why am i even complaining about this, idk. Confession: I just really want a boyfriend.
