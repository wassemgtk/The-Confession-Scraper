a boy on the first day in my literature class and we have been dating but have not had sex yet. I lied to him when I told him I was a virgin because I didn't want to be pressured into sexy too quickly like so many Times before. Now, we are getting closer to becoming intimate. Do you think he will find out that I'm not a virgin? Will he hate me when he realizes I lied? How will I make it through the rest of the semester in my lit class if he hates me?
