o Garibay, although sometimes I get mixed signals from you and I'm not really sure how to interpret them, I'm starting to have feelings for you. But I'm scared because we live on the thourth floor and I cannot imagine how awkward things would be if you knew it was me. I can't seem to figure you out, but I do know that whenever I see you I suddenly get butterflies and all these cute feelings in my tummy that I haven't felt in a while. I just hope you're kind of feeling the same way.
