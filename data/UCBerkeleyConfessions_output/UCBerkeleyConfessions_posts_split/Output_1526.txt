e you guys talking about our threesome out in public?!ã€€It was supposed to be a secret one-time thing. Now everyone knows about it and is teasing me. I keep getting FB messages from random white girls just because they want a part of a part of me. Was it just a game for you guys? Was I just a tool for vengeance and nothing more? I'm more than just the length of my penis, you know. I'm a real person with real feelings. Your public spat does more harm to me than you know, and I don't get to participate in the makeup sex (well, unless we go for Round 2). 

You guys are assholes, figuratively and literally
