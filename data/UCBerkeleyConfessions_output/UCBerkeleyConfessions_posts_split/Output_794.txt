ys go to the BIG C at night, look at the stars while swinging on the swings, and just wonder why I am here. I sometimes forget that I am at Berkeley. Sometimes I think its a dream, a dream I will eventually wake up from. But its not, because i am here, and I feel like because of Berkeley, my aspirations will become a reality.
