ll, white, athletic, and pretty smart. I look like the stereotypical frat guy, and I'm a little shy when meeting people for the first time. I guess that's why everyone treats me like a douchebag, but really, I'm not. I'm as dorky as they come--I'm into Pokemon, puppies, lame dad jokes, you name it. It's just stupid how it's hard for me to admit it to people, since their reactions are all the same--"What? That doesn't fit you. Are you joking?" for example. Not everyone fits what their looks might imply. I realize my own example might be a superficial one, but extend it to Berkeley students as a whole. Don't judge people by how they look.
