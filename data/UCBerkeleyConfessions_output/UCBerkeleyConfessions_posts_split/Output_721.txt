nyone ever get that sentimental feeling while standing on a balcony that overlooks the bay (especially at night) that comes with attending one of the best universities? Sometimes I'll go to the fire escape and just stand there relishing the breeze and gazing upon the calm of the ocean, because I know it will swallow my secrets but also admire the pride I have for my school. As a freshman I will say this with all my heart: I love Berkeley. Sure, it might be a tad early to say this since I have not yet suffered through the killer classes such as organic chemistry *taking next semester, shudders*, Bio1A, Physics 8A, and all the upper divs a pre med has to go through here but I am so happy to have been accepted and doing okay in my classes. I think submitting my SIR here was one of the best decisions I've ever made. Go Bears! <3 - A fellow class of 2017 student
