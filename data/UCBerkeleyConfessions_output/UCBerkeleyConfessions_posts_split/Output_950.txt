Cai, you are one of the cutest Asian girls I have ever seen at Berkeley. I have seen you at Haas and other various places around campus a few times but all of those times I have either been with my friends or you have been with your friends. If only I could get you alone I would tell you how beautiful you are and that you look like an Asian version of Pocahontas and I would be your John Smith any day.
