s this really annoying fobby kid named Freddy Zhu in two of my classes, and I always catch him staring at me. Every time I take a glimpse, I just see his raging boner in those lame tight-ass pants of his, and his cheeks are red as if he drank 10 shots of liquor. It's really creeping me out. And every time I hear his shitty broken english and horrible pronunciations, it just makes me cringe and want to rip my ears off.
