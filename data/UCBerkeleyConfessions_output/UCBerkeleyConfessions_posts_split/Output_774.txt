overly politically correct, post-modern girl,

Say the word "slave" sometime. It sure is a word, isn't it? Sure, it's got some negative connotations, but wouldn't be really handy to use that word sometimes? Like, say, if you were in a history discussion on the goddamn 18th century slave trade? It sure would make the conversation really fucking choppy and difficult if you were to pause awkwardly every time a normal person would say the words "slave" or "black" and instead substitute with "the people who were unfortunately in that situation" and "people with darker skin" and everything else. 

Now I know you're so afraid of being ostracized by your white and asian classmates (and the one person with darker skin who is, in fact, from India), but I don't think anyone is going to assume that you're a racist land owning elite who whistles Dixie while oppressing minorities with one hand and denying the right to vote with the other just because you said a word which fucking happened historically. Instead, everyone's going to think that you're too scared to leave your bubble of "Everything involving racism shouldn't be talked about, other than it's bad" like every other white suburbanite who feels guilt over something their ancestors didn't even do.
