confess that every rumor about Prof Givental is absolutely, 100%, without a doubt, true. I'm just unable to piece together what he's saying in lecture despite my best attempts. I feel like a stupid sack of shit because everyone else seems fine and Prof Givental is clearly very intelligent and teaching a subject that's child play to him, but for all I try, I just can't figure it out, no matter how much time I spend at the library/asking for help/losing sleep. His accent and handwriting are horrendous and I don't even know where to begin to ask questions; lectures are completely different from homework/discussion problems. My peers either can't help, or can help but aren't willing to waste their time on people who don't get it--they have their own things to do (or at least that's the attitude I've encountered). It's absolutely horrible and I have no idea how I'm going to get out alive. I guess it's a combination of his lack of effectiveness in conveying course material, the failure of my GSI to explain it in a way I might understand, and my own pure, unadulterated stupidity. I came into the class with low hopes and I am sure I will leave not only with those expectations confirmed--despite all my efforts to break out--but also a complete lack of confidence in myself and my abilities. Just wanted to vent. I've basically already abandoned all hope. Be prepared to have given[tal] up all hope only a few weeks in, ye who enter. Have a nice day.
