the GDIs out there who think that you'll get in by telling me at the door that you know a guy who knows a guy who knows a girl who's dating the friend of a guy in a brother's R1B discussion, I'm gonna clue you in: You aren't FUCKING getting in. If you wanna party with us, stop being gay and join a fucking frat, or grow a fucking COCK and make greek friends. If not, stop crowding our front yard and pretending to text people on your phone to get you in. We all know you're just clicking around on facebook, and wondering why you're such a faggot. 

Sincerely, 

Every frat guy ever.
