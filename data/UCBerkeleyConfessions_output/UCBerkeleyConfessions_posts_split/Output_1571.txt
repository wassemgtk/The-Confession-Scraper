t, first off; let me say that this post maybe lengthy and if it's going to be a TL;DR for you, I suggest that you just move on. 

Now, me and this girl have been going out now for quite a while. We've done some pretty crazy things in bed and decided to turn it up a notch about a couple of weeks ago. She asked me if I was ever interested in doing a threesome. I know that may not be that 'crazy' for some of you, but it definitely is for me. I told her that I was very much interested in trying it and wouldn't mind at all as long as she was comfortable with it, too. 

The next thing that she requested was that she wanted it to be "fair" to both of us. That means that she wants to try the threesome twice; one with another girl and one with another guy. I thought that this was a fair proposition as we both get something out of it; however, I was definitely more interested in doing it with another girl for obvious reasons. 

Since we were going to be doing the threesome both ways, we did a rock-paper-scissors game to see which gender we're going to be messing around with first. Turns out that she won and we decided we are going to try with another guy first, then a few weeks later, another girl. Now, my girlfriend works at footlocker and there is this black guy that she works with who she has always found attractive. Somehow, she managed to convince him right away into joining us. Let me say that I have nothing against black people at all, but you will see later in this story how this ****ed up our relationship.

It was a Friday night and we were both pretty nervous about this whole thing, but at the same time, excited as it was a new experience for both of us. We all decided to just rent a hotel room for the night and I decided to bring some drinks and stuff to help us get to know each other. So we were all settled and spent maybe the first 30 minutes just getting to know each other and trying to break the ice. The guy seemed cool and I definitely didn't feel a negative vibe at all. After talking and talking, my girlfriend finally just said "let's **** guys, I'm getting horny". Me and the other guy were both in shock because she was so straight forward about it, but I thought we should play a game to try and 'ease' into it.

What a better way to 'ease' into it than playing strip poker? So I grabbed my deck of cards in my bag and decided this is how we're going to start it off. Now, I'm a pretty damn good poker player so I know I was going to be the last guy to strip. After playing a while, the other guy managed to lose on all of his hands and had to strip barenaked first. You're all going to think that I'm gay for saying this but the moment he took off his underwear, my jaw dropped. This guy was at least ****ing 13 inches big down there, seriously. And as an Asian guy who is only 6 inches big, that thing is gigantic as ****. This guy definitely fits the damn stereotype. We continued playing for about 10 minutes more until we just decided to get into it.

My girlfriend began sucking both of us off. It was weird because I noticed she seemed to be sucking him more than she was suck me; which is understandable since he's the new guy, but still, my dick was just so god damn small compared to him. To be honest, I was a bit jealous but hey, this was part of the deal and I'll get to enjoy myself two girls in about a couple of weeks. We then switched positions and my girlfriend wanted to get ****ed. She continued sucking me off while the other guy was about to **** her. As soon as he put his dick in her, my girlfriend just started screaming and moaning. She was having such an orgasm that she stopped sucking me off and just told me to watch. 

At this point, I felt REALLY jealous. The fact that he has a 13 inch dick made her ****ing scream out of her ***. This was definitely more than I was able to give to her. Still, though, I just kept thinking to myself "don't worry, you'll get your part of the deal" over and over. The guy continued pounding her and it my girlfriend finally said "stop, it's my boyfriend's turn".

So I slipped it in her and gave it to her for about 20 seconds. She then said to me "Wow, seriously, I can't feel anything". So I decided to go in harder but it didn't seem to do anything. The black guy then pushed me off and said to me, "Dude, this is how you **** a *****". He then proceeded to pound her and she was definitely enjoying it.

I really couldn't take it anymore by this point. It was clear that I wasn’t as satisfying as he was. I quickly put my clothes on and left for the night. The next day, I called her and she didn't pick up her phone. She then changed her facebook status and took off "in a relationship". I wanted to talk to her about it because I know it was a ***** move for me to just leave, so I went to her work place. Right when I got to footlocker, I saw her making out with the other guy as she just completely forgot about me.

Not saying that I’m the perfect guy, but it sucks that I can’t have a 13 inch dick like that. Sometimes, it sucks being Asian, but hey, I guess you gotta move on. Still, though, this ruined my relationship. Thought I would just rant...
