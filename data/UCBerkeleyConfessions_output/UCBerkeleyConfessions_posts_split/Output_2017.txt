Everyone! TAKE THE NEXT STEP IN YOUR RELATIONSHIP OR FRIENDSHIP

Have you ever had a crush on old friend? A floormate? A lab partner? Or a friends friend?

TrintMe takes the risk and "friction" out of taking the next step in friendships and relationships you've already established. We call it a "friendship progression application".

Within TrintMe, a true intention or "trint" represents a desired outcome like "grab a cup of coffee" or "romance". You simply set trints for friends and friends of friends, and TrintMe lets you discover where your intentions for each other overlap without revealing areas where they don't.
