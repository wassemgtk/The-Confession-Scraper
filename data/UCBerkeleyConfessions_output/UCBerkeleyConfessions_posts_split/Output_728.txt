second year student @ Cal and I hate to be that person who mopes, but is anyone else currently dealing "sophomore slump?" Besides getting rejected from every club I applied for in the beginning of the semester, I have no respect from anyone other than a close group of friends (I think it's because I complain a lot about stupid things) and I'm seen as an "outcast" by people in the one club I'm currently in. Not only am I seemingly everyone's second choice to hang out with, but I'm also not doing so well in my classes due to the emotional stress of not being accepted and because I recently found out that my brother at home is suicidal. I am not one to give up, but how can I demand more respect from the people around me and not be seen as the kid that just makes jokes? I'm losing my touch and my grip on life. Is it just me or is everyone around them doing amazing things while you can't seem to figure it out? Please! I need advice from people before I have a traumatic breakdown. One more thing: sorry if this post made you sad. Just read down further for happier things.
