I may have good grades and sure I may be at Cal, but the only thing I've wanted since my freshman year in high school is a girlfriend.  My friends tell me I'm always nice, caring, and wise beyond my years but I feel like it means nothing when both my roommates hook up with girls almost daily and are complete assholes.  All I want is to take a girl on a date who I find interesting and she feels the same about me.  I don't want to hook up at some Friday night party and feel like a complete douche the next day.  I just want somebody that I can trust and talk to and cuddle with whenever.  I feel like that's not a lot to ask for since people at Berkeley have a decent amount of stuff in common, but I just can't find anybody who likes me back.  And that is why I have this lingering regret of coming to Berkeley instead of Boulder.
