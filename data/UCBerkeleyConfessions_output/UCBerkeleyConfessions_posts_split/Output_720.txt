k it's ironic how the school prides itself on free speech but anything not politically correct is automatically shut down. If I want to dress up as a Nazi for Halloween I should fucking be able to. And also, fuck feminism. Do you know how fucked up family court is when it comes to being in favor towards women? And alimony? Marriage is like a shit deal for men because a woman can cheat, have a bastard, divorce her husband and make him pay child support while she moves in with the real father. But nobody around me has the balls to stand up with me against the politically correct mentality. Woman can get away with doing almost anything in society. 

PS. I'm Asian and I hate Nazi ideology. But if you believe it then you should be able to voice your opinions. Free speech. Shoutout to the guy with swastika chalk art.
