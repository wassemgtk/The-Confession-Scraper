coming to Berkeley I knew it was going to be a challenge, but I was determined that I would figure it all out once I got here.Coming to Berkeley has been one of the hardest things I've ever done. I am literally working the hardest I have ever worked and time after time I am disappointed that even with all the work I put in, that I am barely passing and in some cases failing. I came in with an idea of what I wanted to pursue, and now I unsure of what to do. It is a routine of stressing myself out and pushing myself, and all for what seems like nothing. 

I used to be very social, now I am spending most of my time in class, in the library, or in my room studying, reading, or writing a paper. I still make a conscious effort to stop, take a break, eat, shower, and sleep, but I'm always thinking of when is all this going to just explode and I lose it. 

It's hard seeing everyone else manage all of this, while I am here on the edge of what feels like the lowest point I've ever been in my life. Some days I think of transferring out to a community college, but I have too much pride to throw away everything. Sometimes I dream I had the courage to just call it quits, sell everything in my possession, gather all my money from bank accounts, pick up my passport and just fall off the grid. I'd much rather spend this one life I had exploring all the beauty of the world. Go base jumping, go cliff diving on some remote island, climb a mountain, experience all there is in life...

Anyways, if you took the time to hear me vent all my issues thank you. Just putting this all down helped me clear my head.
