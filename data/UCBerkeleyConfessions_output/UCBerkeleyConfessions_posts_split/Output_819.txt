I met you at TDX the day after Halloween. I'm not sure what you were supposed to be but you had on zebra ears and were incredibly cute. I noticed you were on your way to being drunk and I wanted to approach you, but you were engulfed in a massive group of white/Asian girls. Just as I had summoned the courage to make my way up and say hi, I noticed an Indian guy with his arm around you. Asian girl ---- you were so cute! I remember seeing a random Mexican dude ask you to dance and later when I asked him about you, he said you were floor mates! You live at unit 2...please if you see this post I'd like to take you out for breakfast some time. You don't look super Asian so perhaps we can have some bacon, eggs, and toast? You know...a regular American breakfast. Till then. Stay golden my beautiful Asian.
your white "lover"
