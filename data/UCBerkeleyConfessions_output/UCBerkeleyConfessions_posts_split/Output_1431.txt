all these self-isolated, weakass cigarette-smoking international students top all the math and stats curves as a product of studying at the threshold of their waking moments gives me a specific type of fuck you syndrome.

This refers to the subset of international students that shut down your friendly approach for not speaking their own language, have no problem copying each others' work to get ahead, tend to be spoiled shitless, etc. 

Fuck your excuses for not taking part in what you signed up for. You're defiling the opportunities surrounding you and taking the grades that are needed by people who give a shit about opportunity and progression.

Respect to the international students who take the brave step of cultural and linguistic immersion (and much more).
