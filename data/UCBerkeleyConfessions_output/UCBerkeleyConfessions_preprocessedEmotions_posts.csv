I'm posting this here because You said you were from UC Berkeley. First of all, you're supposed to be asking for donations, not pressuring people to squeeze their wallets for you. 2nd, You humiliated me on the train right after I refused to donate and branded me as ""someone programmed to society."" When I told you ""im not from around here,"" you completely ignored what I said and insulted me in public. Your attitude disgusts me, and I hope you realize it yourself before it becomes a big problem for you.

Sincerely, Roxas"

11,2014-05-13 00:20:26,"'ve been studying all night for my 8 AM final. A couple minutes ago I realized that I needed a little study/pee break, so I went into the bathroom and took care of my business. Then I realized I was slightly horny and wasn't quite ready to go back to work, so I went back into the handicapped stall, whipped out da Hub on my cellular phone. Once I had found a vid of some German milf blowing ""police officers,"" I pulled out my Johnson and started beating the monkey. It is important to note that I have my peen in one hand and my phone in the other. Its slightly precarious, but I make it work. After a couple minutes, the video started getting weird (those Germans :/) so I decided I should switch it up a little. I went back to the home page and skipped through a couple pages, found something that looked suitable for the job, and went back to it. The video started a little slow though, so I repositioned my grip with my phone hand so that I could move the video ahead a bit. My phone started to slip out of my hand, headed directly for the disgusting handicapped toilet bowl. *GASP!!* I squirmed to save my phone and just in time juggled it against my body, pressing it into my chest. Safety. I regained composure, carefully skipped the video ahead past the opening credits, and continue with the deed. When I came, it was the sweet, victorious cum of a man who had stared doom strait in the face and won. At that moment, like Andy Dufresne, I could have crawled through a quarter mile of shit and come out a clean man. Plus, my phone still works and isn't covered in toilet water!
In related news, I am stoked to be moving out of the dorms in 4 days! #tp"
12,2014-05-10 22:05:30,"eeing people save spots in Main Stacks with their books/notes for extended periods of time makes me absolutely sick. Its a tragedy of the commons situation - individual selfishness and greed makes life difficult for everybody. 

If nobody saved spots, there would be plenty of spaces to go around all the time, so nobody would worry about saving spots. But since some assholes decide to save spots, space is limited and so people who ordinarily would not save a place will do so because if they do not they worry they won't have a place to study later. 

To fix a tragedy of the commons situation, you've gotta impose risks and disincentives to make most people avoid being shitheads. So from now on I'm gonna be the Stacks Batman:

Be warned, assholes of stacks, if I'm sitting at a table, and you leave and don't come back for over an hour, I'm gonna hide your things. Simple as that. Let this be a warning to everyone who uses stacks. In fact, I'll probably send pictures of the things I've taken and hidden to UCB confessions, with name and personal info exposed, so that we all can see who the assholes of stacks are. So if you'd like to risk losing your notes the week before finals, carry on."

It then lead to him giving me a hand job. When I finally came, he kept stoking my penis. It felt great but it started feeling weird after a while. He kept stroking and I felt something about to come out. Naturally, I expected it to be more semen but it turned out being urine. I peed all over that poor guy's hand! It was soo embarrassing!

23,2014-05-07 15:01:48,"ometimes I do fall into the dark pit of thinking Berkeley is the wrong school for me—that I picked it because it was one of the most prestigious schools I got accepted to, and not because I actually wanted to come here.
The lack of fun, the awkward people, the dangerous streets, and the ridiculous grade inflation and competition (from all the pre-Haas, pre-meds, etc.) all have me regretting my choice to have come to this school.

However, I realize that I am chasing my dreams here. Berkeley was the school I wanted to go to since I was 7—before I understood anything about college rankings and Nobel prizes—and that dream is being achieved. I may be struggling in classes and some nights, I may be lonelier than I want to admit, but I'm proud to be here. I'm proud to go to other states and countries and tell people: ""I go to UC Berkeley"" and see the awe shine in their faces. I'm proud to be a part of a campus that's notorious for civil rights rallies, marijuana, and a phenomenal arts scene.
When it comes down to it, I got here to this point in my life—higher than 90% of the world could even imagine of rising to—and I may have some bad grades but I also have spectacular ones, and those are what I should be proud of. I don't always feel at place here but I feel lucky to even be considered a Berkeley student. And I wouldn't have it any other way."

But I noticed a peculiar person. An a tight young asian girl with firm b-cup titties, and a bubble butt. She was adorable and I marveled at her naked body as I video taped her running across the room. Just as she and her friends left, I went over and grabbed her clothes.

I immediately licked her g-string and stuffed it into my pocket. I took her bra, her t-shirt, and her shorts and shoved them into my backpack, and then I waited for the nudists to return.

She eventually returned but spent about 20 minutes looking for her stuff, while I recorded her naked body from a distance. A video I still jerk off to to this day. 

She gave up and one of her friends gave her a t shirt and some underwear and she began her humiliating walk home. Little did she know that I still have her underwear and I sniff them as much as I can.

30,2014-05-06 18:47:11,"'m bisexual in a social fraternity, but I don't feel comfortable coming out to anyone, even though there are other gay people in my fraternity too. It's easy to hide. Bisexuality is so misunderstood, as some transitional phase between homosexuality and heterosexuality, like it doesn't really exist. Whenever people want to talk about girls, I can do that because I'm actually interested in them, and people will think I'm straight. But sometimes, I just want to talk about (and casually hook up with?) guys too. Who would I be able to talk to about this? Do you think my girlfriend would be down?"
31,2014-05-06 18:41:12,"ome GSIs take their ""job"" too serious. I understand you 'care' about education and strive to teach a great deal of material to your students.... but seriously, that high horse you're sitting on, is imaginary. Really, it is. Preaching rights, equality, and righteousness, while enjoying your power trip makes you look like a douche bag. Grading down to encourage higher quality work (when the work is absolutely fine) is abusive and unfair. Furthermore, saying that grades dont matter and it should be about the education as you encourage us to go into grad school makes you hella stupid. You're not encouraging students to do better when you make them feel inadequate because you have self esteem issues. Stop acting like you're some hot shit. You're not. Given, you may know a lot - and thats great! But being a dick about it, makes you hated across campus. And its easier to talk shit about a single GSI who is on a power trip, than a GSI talking shit about undergraduates who emphasize your unfair evaluation of students' work. And I hate to admit this, but female GSIs seem to have it the worst."

Whenever I try to start a conversation, all I get are one word responses. It just got to a point that I stopped trying to even make an effort to talk to them anymore. The other people on my floor are just as unfriendly and rude. Even though there are always people around me, I have never felt so lonely. It seems like everyone here has made close friends already, so no one even cares about meeting new people anymore. People here can be so cliquish. There's no one to talk to here.

A semester at Berkeley 
It's been quite a ride
But finals are here
And there's nowhere to hide

The time now has come
To reflect on the year
On essays, and asians
And truckloads of beer 

Gettin frisky at the Coops 
Blacking out at SAE 
Trying coke for the first time
Cause how bad could it be?

Gameday turnup 9 am
Lookin for conquest 
Drunken hookup with a 9
But a sober 4 at best  

Dinner at Asian ghetto
Hobos on the prowl 
Thank Jesus for Berkeley time 
But fuck flyers on Sproul

Vitali flows like waterfalls
Cheep beer like a river 
We've got giant brains goddamit
Who needs a fucking liver

Through cold-ass fucking winters
And heart crushing breakups
Through late nights at the Library 
And phone-alarm wakeups

Through all of the trauma 
Of that hard Berkeley Grind 
A semester at Berkeley
Is the best you can find 

So here's to the fall
And the coming Spring months
And prepare for more fun
Cause you only live once"

I understand that we don’t all come from similar backgrounds here and maybe things were tight for you. I get that, I really do. Quite honestly, I most likely wouldn’t have been angry if you had taken the $40 cash and just given me at least my room keys and Cal1Card. What I don’t understand is why you didn’t stop to think that maybe this decision wouldn’t just affect you. I hope you know that you making the conscious decision to take my wallet and everything in it not only ruined my day and any chances of studying for finals, but it had a negative impact on most people around me. My parents had to deal with my constant upset phone calls while they were trying to work, my roommate and suitemate had to take time out of their schedule to be available and let me in my own room, my friends had to deal with my bad mood, and the girls in my sorority house had to deal with the noise of me angrily trying to cancel my credit/debit cards as they were trying to study for finals. And not only did your conscious decision have a negative impact on these people, you made sure that I wouldn’t have a positive impact on others. When I woke up this morning, I was convinced I was going to have a good day. Who knows, maybe I would have given a homeless man some spare change or swiped hungry students in with the ID that you took from me, or even just smiled at people walking down the street and brightened their day. But you made sure this didn’t happen. So next time you find someone’s wallet on the ground, think twice about who you are really affecting when you have that choice to make. 
Sincerely, 
Everyone who could have had a good day"

Crammed cafes and library dates, Regretting the days that you slept in late While out on the campus there struck a big nerve, Of Asian kids sprinting to mess up the curve. The readings you ignored piled up to the ceiling; Our asses are saved by Wikipedia stealing. Time home for thanksgiving was a bittersweet tease, Come back to find college screwing you on your knees. Facebook and Twitter prove a hefty temptation, Earning your citizenship in the procrasti-NATION Exams handed out, the questions complex; Pray that it’s over like a night of bad sex Eyes begin wandering while we’re crammed in our seats; That one kid is dragged out for trying to cheat Smelly dude next to me, chill bro you’re fine! Lord knows that your grade will be better than mine Hand in the exam, relieved that it’s done; It’s been real but the furthest from fun Four down, one to go, and to all that relate.

58,2013-12-13 01:47:57,"o the brunette in Alpha Phi that I brought back to my apartment last weekend:

I was blacked out only knew I brought you home because my house-mate saw you on your way out in the morning. I found 2 condoms a couple feet from my trashcan when I finally managed to shake of that raging headache and get out of bed. I also found almost all of the lube in my dresser drawer on my sheets and surrounding the bottle on my floor. I literally have no idea what happened, but I thought your name was Laura or Lauren or something like that. I think I got your number, but since I don't know your name, looking though my contacts list doesn't help much. 

I you remember who I am, and you somehow happen to still have my number, you should hit me up. As fun as it is to not remember a night of nailing a hot sorority girl in my apartment, next time (if there is a next time) I hope we can do it pre-alcohol poisoning? I think some people here would call that rape, but I won't judge you that harshly. With the amount of lube missing from my bottle, I can only hope that we did anal, or at least something crazy. 

Let me know if we can make this work again.

Also, I VERY SLIGHTLY remember you saying something about a boyfriend to me last night. If you are currently in a relationship, I'd call you a pretty fucked up person. But I guess as the old saying goes, if someone's already got dibs on the pussy, just fuck the ass.

Talk / see you soon?"

Life was good, wasn't stressing too much, and for the most part, my friendships were pretty good.  And then the fire nation attacked.  and by that, I mean that my best friend (and roommate) hooked up with my ex (a floor-mate), and I've just sat here as it feels like almost every one of my major friendships here is just unraveling and I feel powerless to stop it.  I didn't do a good enough job branching out at the beginning of the year (due to just sticking with my now ex), and now that my friendship with someone that I considered my bro has been compromised, I feel as though I have next to no where to turn.  The only places that I've really been able to find a consistent source of happiness have been at the gym, at work (which is also the gym), and in the bottom of what was an alcohol-filled cup.  For me, I feel like its time to turn a new leaf, and make some new friends.  I'll still keep the old ones in my life, but I feel like I need some people that I can actually count on.  With it being dead week/finals however, I haven't got a clue as to where to start.  Any ideas?  Also, anyone else going through a similar deal?"

The attractive part is understandable, but somehow the friendly part makes me feel cheated.  Like I wanted to think they were all vicious creatures.  But that's false.  So it's not intimidation. 

I force myself to get up at 5 am everyday and jog/cycle outside so I can avoid them. And lift in my room--the RSF is absolutely the worst place for me.  Too many doing cardio.  I sometimes start walking to campus for lecture, but then after noticing a pretty, smiling girl, I turn around and slink back to my room inexplicably demotivated.  I often get to-go boxes from Xroads and get back as fast as possible or sit in front of windows.  In my room I can finally raise my head and look straight ahead without fear (unless it's buried in a textbook).  In fact this RRR week is the best because they're likely studying and not in my view.

63,2013-12-11 16:15:15,"met my girlfriend at a party a friend of mine from high school through in Berkeley. She's amazing: smart, funny, spontaneous - more than I could ever hope to end up with. Just the thing is - she's super passionate about Cal and has an avid passion for hating Stanford. Plot twist: I got to Stanford and she has no idea. 

As the UC Berkeley community, what do you guys think I should do? If I tell her, she will undoubtedly hate me forever. And if I don't, then I can't really bring her home all the way in Palo Alto to my dorm.. Every time we've ""chilled"", it was at her place and she's been hinting at wanting to see my place for a while. What do I do?"

I transferred here from community college and i didn't want to find an apt so I decided to just live in the residence halls since I can I pass for 22. He thinks we are close in age but we really are 7 years apart. I lied to him because I didn't think our relationship would be anything more than a fling but now he's told me he loves me. I feel scared that he will find out my age on the internet by doing a name search. I feel like I want to get out of the relationship because our age difference but my feelings for him prevent me from saying goodbye although I constantly threaten him that we will have to part.

When I walked in the room I noticed the couch was turned around and there was a blanket moving around on the other side of it.  There were some noises and whispering coming from under the blanket.  It did not take me long to realize that there was some passionate sexual activity going on under that blanket.  I hesitated for a moment then turned around to leave. I then changed my mind and headed for the piano.  I hope my romantic love songs and passionate singing was appreciated. Your Welcome

With no residence, no cellphone to be contacted by, dirty clothes and bad smell...you are not gonna be hired everywhere. My father was homeless at one point in his life and it took him years to get back on his feet. Next time you talk about the homeless issue..look for solutions and not useless criticism.

When I returned back to my room, I decided to pull up both of our responses, which are posted to an open forum that all class members can view (I posted my response a good seven hours before the student). After all, the topic was rather specific and the instructions called for referencing specific readings, so I wondered how similar they could be. I now understand why my GSI raised his eyebrows; you literally copied and pasted my response, thinking you were so clever by switching the last two paragraphs, inserting some quotes, and rearranging my sentences. I know who you are now, and you picked the wrong student to plagiarize. Academic dishonesty makes me sick. I hope you fail this class and/or are kicked out of Cal."

110,2013-11-26 00:54:45,"ver like a shy guy? I'm pretty quiet and shy (to a point that my RA forgot that I even existed) and I have never been in a relationship (or for the most part, had girls notice me)
People talk about having 20,30 girlfriends (some of whose names they don't remember anymore) and having had sex with atleast twice as many more, and I am jealous of that. I hate to admit it, but I am. I guess that makes me a pervert for wanting to have sex, but so be it. But alas! I've never even known what a kiss felt like, let alone, sex.

I really want to change that. I do, honestly. I want to be that loud, cool, funny kid that gets tons of attractive girls. And I try - I do! - I try to go to parties and drink and meet people and be social, but no matter what, I feel really awkward when I try to do that, partially due to my own physical insecurities (terrible teeth, glasses, slightly overweight [although I have been working on that; lost about 15 pounds in 3 months :S], etc.), and partially due to constant rejection at any attempt to attract a girl. No matter what I do, I always end end up being the guy who makes the girl[s] breakfast and takes them home in the morning, rather than the guy who actually brings them home in the first place. I try to act like it doesn't phase me - i even made up a bullshit story to my roommates about trying to be abstinent so that they don't feel sorry for my lack of sexual activity - but the truth is: I really want to be the guy that girls find attractive and dream about. I want to be that guy girls yearn a text from and talk to their friends about. I was that guy who makes girl's stomachs fills with butterflies when they perceive me. I want to be that guy: somebody who exists only in my fantasies, someone who I can never be in real life, despite my best attempts. Someone who girls will never see anything for except a nice guy and perhaps, slightly intelligent. They say nice guys do win - in the end. But I'm tired of waiting, and I have this incredible penchant to losing. Unlike most of my friends and people I hang out with, I'm not going to know what sexual selection means, I'm not going to have the choice of playing the ""dating"" game, and I'm probably to end up marrying the first girl that actually pays attention to me. And this thought is KILLING me inside. 

And please don't say any of that - don't worry, you'll find someone!, etc, etc, bullshit, bullshit. That's like telling the limit of n as it approaches infinity, ""oh, don't worry! You'll find an integer someday!""

118,2013-11-25 14:11:57,"o all of the people that are feeling down, because of large number of couples that get together for the holidays. Please don't get into a relationship for the wrong reasons! Love comes naturally, and love is when you care about someone, pretty cliché right? Well, the truth is love is when you feel that way about a person. You want to make her smile, make her happy, hear her laugh, hear her voice, and have her presence around you. So.. in a sense you don’t ever look for a relationship to be happy, you get into a relationship when you feel that strongly about someone. So if you’re thinking, I’m lonely, I’m horny, I want someone there for me, you’re only thinking about yourself and not someone else, a relationship isn’t for you. Love is selfless, so if someone is there for you and you’re only thinking about how you can benefit, that person truly loves you.  Because of all the pain you’ve caused them, all the aguish about caring about yourself, and they’re still there because you’re happy.

That’s when you love someone, and even if those feelings are softened over time, it’s how you get soften the falls and work as a team to build it back up. People love not for themselves, but for the ones they love.

Eh, I guess I get some-what philosophical in the shower. But sadly, even if you do truly care about someone, they still might not feel the same way about you. In the end, sometimes the only way to keep someone you love in your life, is just by being their friend."

128,2013-11-25 14:47:21,"ll of a sudden two decades have passed and you still have not kissed anyone with tongue, or kissed anyone at all for that matter, or had a 3 AM conversation with someone who would rather look into your eyes for ten minutes straight than talk. You have never worn a lover’s sweater or “forgotten” it at home in your bedroom just so you would have an excuse to see them again. You have never even stood face-to-face with someone who makes your hands shake so hard it feels like they’re both having a separate anxiety attack.
This causes you much guilt and self-blame and sadness but above all, an overwhelming curiosity. Are you really that ugly, that unwanted, that uninteresting, that boring, that no one, absolutely no one, has ever looked at you like the only thing on earth?
The answer is no. The better answer is that someone out there, somewhere in the world, is “wondering what it’s like to meet someone like you,” and they have two decades worth of love stored in their veins like a shoot-‘em-up drug, and they’re just about ready to inject it into someone else’s bloodstream. All you have to do is roll up your sleeves and wait for it to happen.
At times you felt so lonely you could stand at the edge of a cliff with nothing beneath you but air and grass and a long, long way down, and you’d still feel emptier than that canyon itself. Maybe you even danced with yourself alone in your room a few times, arms outstretched around a ghost, pretending someone else’s hands were on your waist, someone else’s eyes boring into yours.
Or maybe you fell temporarily in love with strangers on public transportation, fell in love with anybody who so much as accidentally brushed your hand on the way past. For you, falling in love with dozens of people a day was a coping mechanism for not having anyone to love you in return. But people are not eggs and falling in love with a dozen of them does not mean your shell will remain uncracked. One day you’re going to hit the point where you’re so desperate for human contact that you’re going to snap in half and all your love will bleed out like egg yolk.
But someone out there is eating a bowl of Ramen noodles right now, or putting on slippers, or settling into bed. They are doing all the normal things that you’ve done in your own life. They are just like you. They have cellulite and extra fat in all the wrong places and goals and fears and doubts and bad handwriting.
The truth is that they are just like you, and being just like you, they’re looking for a lover too. They’re what you might call a soulmate.
They think they’re all alone in feeling the way they do, but you’re really both two halves of a whole.
And one day you’ll meet them, bump into them on the street, and your two halves will be put together, and you’ll make one."

138,2013-11-24 22:48:43,"ast year, as a freshman, I was oh so young. I didn't know anything about the world, or let alone myself for that matter. By chance, I met a guy at this club meeting — you know, the earlier ones of the semester with all the ice-breakers, the awkward obligatory handshakes. It wasn't just any club meeting, though. It was safe space for queer people to meet and interact. I went alone without any expectations set, but as soon as I stepped through the doors of Dwinelle, my eyes gazed upon whom I once thought was the most handsome guy I had ever seen. 

I approached him. 
I asked him for his name. 
He asked me mine.
We talked more and more, and before we knew it, the entire night was gone. Sparks flew, and one might even say that it was love at first sight. I had finally met a guy who I found attractive, funny, and just like me. My sheltered, inexperienced self felt empowered by the very idea of finding someone special. And things went from there.

We ended up dating for 8 months. Man, we were in love. Many of those who knew of our relationship loved us together, and we even molded the minds of those who had very rigid images of gay people. Those 8 months were some of the best times I ever had. That's what I thought at the time, anyway. 

But after a petty tiff one night, he completely changed as a person. He stopped texting me, talking to me, hugging and kissing me... He no longer wanted to associate with me or my friends. When I packed my bags to go home after my last final exam in May, we kissed and cried together in the dorm stairwell. A week later, he gave me that dreadful call.

From yesterday, it has been 6 months since he broke up with me. Even to this day, I'm not sure what happened to him. Even though he has hurt (and still hurts) me so much, I care a lot about him.

When I look back, I realize how blinded I was. I projected a perfect, immaculate facade onto him, when in reality, he was a twisted, profane, immature, cowardly, lazy, depressed, and immoral person. However, I only realize these things in hindsight.

This is my main takeaway message: there is so much for you to learn from within yourself before you can even imagine looking beyond. We often think too much about others, especially when it comes to relationships. But we are all so young, and believing that we'll meet that special someone in college is unrealistic and overly idealistic. People are too complicated and impulsive at this age to know what they really want. However, to those who have found their companions, I wish you the very best. You're probably experiencing something very special.

And to all those gay guys who may feel closeted and unsure of things: don't get bogged down. If you've ever visited Grindr or Jack'd, those apps are crawling with sex addicts and people who don't give a shit about your feelings. If that's what you want, then more power to you! Have sex, meet randos from the street across yours. But you don't HAVE to live that life. Make strong friendships, be around those who matter, and have a good time here. 

You really do discover a lot about yourself in this high-strung, relentless, drug-infested place many of us call home. Thanks a ton, Cal.

Sincerely,
Your loving, pseudo-closeted gay friend"

147,2013-11-24 22:29:56,"ust a warning to people who walk past Dwinelle/Wheeler/and other halls in that proximity at night.. please be careful.
Last night, I was walking back to Bowles, and I saw 3-4 people next to this black Subaru, and they kept flashing their headlights at me. I was confused and didn't really know what to do..I started walking a little bit more quickly until one of them (tall, in-shape??, 20ish years old) started approaching me briskly. Being the dumbass I am, I stopped and asked the guy what he needed. His buddy came charging at me with a bat and looked like he was going to fucking swing me. Luckily, I pulled the bat away, gave the guy a right hook and Zab Judah legs.. and his friends ran back in the car and drove off quickly..
I looked at the unconscious body...and I tried looking for a driver's license. Nothing. A Cal Card? Nope. He was completely clean of any form of ID. I called my roommates and they laughed at me and didn't believe me..so the last thing I did was call my mom. After I told her the story, she started bawling on me and got scared and said, “You’re movin’ with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air.” I whistled for a cab and when it came near The license plate said fresh and it had dice in the mirror If anything I could say that this cab was rare But I thought, “Nah, forget it. Yo home to Bel-Air!” I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8 And I yelled to the cabby yo holmes smell ya later Looked at my kingdom I was finally there To sit on my throne as the prince of Bel-Air"
148,2013-11-24 22:47:57,"ardon the ramblings of a possibly crazy kid, but...

Sometimes, deep down, I think of wanting to be put in some kind of prolonged dangerous situation, or sad circumstance, or some kind of arduous video-game like journey with friends, and then overcome it together. I just think it's... a beautiful thing, to be able to overcome the danger, the sadness, the obstacles, together with your friends beside you. In so doing, those bonds shine brighter, you understand each other more, and you know you can always count on each other for support. I know it's bad of me to think this way, since of course I don't want my friends to suffer or anything, but at the same time, I just think it'd be a very... human thing. To be there for each other during not only the happy, fun times, but also the sad, dangerous times... to go through together opposing sides of the spectrum of the human experience - happiness and sorrow, peace and danger, light and darkness - isn't that a beautiful thing...? Being there for each other only during the happy times, and not the sad times... that's not what friends are for, is it? 

It's taken a bit of effort for me to talk about this, so I hope I won't get shot down so fast haha..."
149,2013-11-24 22:18:10,"'m really bothered by the steady increase of suspicious people around campus and south side. It's not just all the armed robberies that are up by around 100% since last year, but also just seeing all the suspicious looking people hanging/driving around campus who clearly don't go to Cal and are clearly up to no good.

I'm not bothered as a person scared of being victimized. I'm annoyed as a much bigger than average guy who doesn't leave his house without a large pocket knife, who doesn't want the day to come that he has to hurt someone while protecting himself or one of his friends.

Really, I am not confident in UCPD. The few experiences I have had with them were bad. The worst of which and most recent was overhearing one of them making fun of an international student and telling his colleague the kid's English was so bad that he just gave up trying to understand him and wrote scribbles on the police report, and then saying something to the likes of it doesn't matter because no one actually looks at the police reports anyways.

I think that part of my tuition is going to afford me a quality of education that at least lets me feel safe when I am walking less than a mile from home to campus. UCPD officers certainly make more than the large majority of Cal graduates, if their compensation is exemplary shouldn't their performance follow suite? 

Am I the only one who doesn't have confidence in UCPD or the current state of campus safety?"
150,2013-11-24 22:09:11,"t's so hard to find genuine and attractive girls at Berkeley. When a girl is hot, she usually tends to either go for sarcastic or jerky-type guys and I get that - they're so used to having a good time that this is almost instinctive. And that's completely fine. But just once, I wish hot girls would be into the intellectual and deep shit too. Sure, I've found girls that DO want to talk about life and our role here, etc, etc, but more often than not, they're usually not as attractive or outgoing as the party-type girls. (btw, I should really write an algorithm on this later: the correlation between girls that party and intellectuals) But yeah, moral of the story: if you're hot, don't be afraid to ""downplay"" yourself and try to be intellectual! If anything, it only makes you more attractive! (or, atleast to me)"

I walked back behind those moving bookcases in stacks and saw an Asian guy hunched over in his chair at a cubicle looking down into his lap. At first I thought he was trying to erase something on his zipper with a #2 Ticonderoga, but I soon realized that the thin yellow stick between his thumb and forefinger was no pencil... at this point, he seemed to notice he was no longer alone. He let out the biggest panicked hamster scream yet and in his excitement, ejaculated onto his thick-lensed glasses.

Now she is happy with another man, while I am here depressed the fuck out, all I do is sleep and I am worried about my future at Cal. She was my motivation, and everything I wanted and needed. I honestly do not know how to cope with all of this depression. I am a broken man. I dream of her every night, so sleeping does not even help me deal with this. Has anyone experienced this? if so, can you please help me.."

Yesterday, on 11-22 at about noon-ish-1ish my friends and I were standing by the table that was selling the StanfUrd shirts and as a joke I told my friend to yell out to people to buy the shirts to help our other friend out. She yelled out to you, saying, ""You should buy this shirt, you'll look beautiful in it"" to which you responded with a smile. You were the only person to respond in a friendly manner and to top it off you had a beautiful smile. Thanks for being friendly and flashing us a smile and on  that note I'd love to be friends :) It's nice seeing friendly people on campus. <- take note Cal kids!

208,2013-11-23 19:00:57,"t may be been 2 years ago I noticed it. My drinking become a problem. I knew my point of handling alcohol but I always pushed past it, always knowing it too; I made an effort to push it. Then sleeping with strange men (4 total), I would always make sure I was drunk beforehand. Every weekend I had to have a drink. Whenever I went out, I had to drink something. Then the hurtful words starting coming. I began to say terrible things to the people I loved. The blackout moments became more frequent. So last year, I made an effort to stop.

I gave in saying ""It's okay, I can have one or a few."" I stopped pushing that point of getting 'shitfaced'. I've limited myself to only 2 at most. 

The part that makes me want to cry is no matter how hard I try, whenever I see someone with beer or go into a restaurant that has a bar I hear a little voice in my head saying ""Do it, it's just one drink."" When someone offers me a beer, it's literally a fight inside me that says no and when I do, I have a lingering of regret because it's only one drink. Between Thursday and Saturday I think about it. I'm afraid to go out with friends because of that feeling and knowing alcohol will be readily available. 

I want to cry because I can't go out with friends without fighting myself inside to merely say no. I keep myself inside and as far away from parties or outings just so I don't have to say no. It hurts because I'm keeping myself from so many dinners and get togethers.

Now, I'm giving in. I can't fight this alone because I'm missing parts of my life because of the urge to drink. I want help but I don't know where to start. I'm going to graduate so I won't have access to tang so I don't know where to go. What am I going to do? I want to cry because I'm trying so hard because I don't want this to be a factor that controls myself."

One moment you are yourself, never thinking of suicide, then it hits you.  The ocean of hopelessness and the loss of any will to continue.  It cannot be adequately described.

238,2013-11-22 18:27:57,"y greatest fear as an engineer is what people will do with the stuff I come up with. The uncertainty of whether it will be used to help or hurt other people. Planned obsolescence. Proprietary designs with the intent to exploit and hurt targeted groups of people. Corporate shuttles and the gentrification of neighborhoods. Racism, sexism, and all that other bad stuff. I may not understand it completely, but I was never exposed to this side of engineering before. Selfishness in design. Complete disregard for just everything in general. In the past I’ve only read about it. Never have I had to experience it first-hand. This is why I’m disheartened. 

Just this week I’ve read stories on people being injured or even killed because of thefts of things like iPhones or nice cars. Or lines to get the new this or that; the people who have and those who don’t, not because of money, but because of supply. The people who have waited their entire lives to get some thing only to be price-gouged at the last minute or artificially-reduced supply. A system I will be contributing to for selfish interest.

Just looking at some of the price gouging on the Free and For Sale page makes me sad that people are doing this kind of stuff and I wonder if they realize all the people they are disappointing. At this point I’m just rambling but my greatest fear as an engineer is that lose control of what I make to the selfish and greedy who will use it to hurt others, to disappoint others, and to exploit others for personal gain. My only hope is that there others out there who just want to make awesome stuff, because in the end, that’s what really matters."

Every Friday between 10-1030 (the only time I know my roommate is gone for sure) I get out my hairbursh from under my bed and dip it in a jar of honey.  Once its nice and lathered up I then roll it in trail mix until it has a nice coating.  I then sneakily go down to the unit kitchen and microwave it for a good 10-15 mins.  (sorry if youve had to wait on me there but this shit is important to me)  Once prepared I bring the brush back up to my room and lather its now bumpy wax-like exterior in a Teriyaki/A-1 marinade until its glistening all around.  After thats done I wrap it entirely in double sided tape and then roll the sticky exterior in some cajun trail mix (real cayenne pepper).  I then proceed to vigorously plunge it into my anus and remove it each time with a twisting motion.  I usually bite down on a sweaty sock to keep my suitemates from hearing my gasps of pleasure.  When I'm near an anal queef I give it one last good plunge and then force myself to sneeze while I yank it out as hard and as viciously as I can.  Once the  deed has been done (and we're approaching the 1030 mark) I drop the brush into the clothing donation bin outside my unit.

So I just wanted to post this so you know that its not weird and that you're not alone.  There's power in numbers!  :)"
248,2013-11-22 18:17:21,"rom someone who just landed an $80k+ salary from a ""stupid humanities"" major, here is some real talk:
1. If you are in a major that is not inherently credible for the work force, accept it. Get the baseline GPA that you need for people not to gloss over your resume and don't worry about fighting for incremental increases. That's not what helps. Besides the sciences, very few doors are immediately closed for you just because of the name of your major.
2. Kill it on extracurriculars and work experience. Absolutely try for everything you can get, while being unique. Look for things abroad, for example. You can score paid internships in different parts of the world because you know English. That will make you stand out. Learn new skills like web design or how to use statistical databases. You need to stuff your resume with things that prove that you're more than your major.
3. You can get the best of both worlds--preserve that high GPA you get from humanities and get a good salary to set yourself up for the future.
pi. EECS kids can go suck it.
4. If you can, spend your senior year taking classes that don't require attendance, so you can interview for more positions and build skills. Fortunately, many humanities classes accommodate this handsomely.
5. Nothing you learn in your classes will actually help you. Legal/paralegal jobs don't use anything you learn in Legal Studies. Political jobs will almost never use anything you learn in Political Science. Stop using these degrees to advertise yourself in the workforce. Use your skill set to do so."

Here is this man, using the light from a store to read and expand his mind and I'm here bitching and not doing anything just stagnant because I'm depressed. (Talking to my dad and getting upset that he just doesnt understand why i got a D on my midterm i studied for, and him telling me my only job is to go to school. )Then, I said to myself ""fuck you get your shit together"" it may be too late, maybe not, in the semester but finally I feel like I'm getting my motivation back. The motivation that got me into Berkeley in the first place, the motivation I once had to change the world, to live and make every moment worthwhile. I am sick of being sick and tired, I want my life back. I want to do something important and I don't want to serve you your grande mocha frap in the future. 
I hope all you that feel this way get your motivation back too from one golden bear to another. 
Love, 
Golden bear with golden hair <3"

Problem is, he's got a girlfriend, a long distance one, and apparently they're pretty serious. (for the record, and I swear I'm not a cocky person, but I am def cuter)

I was never allowed to do sports as a kid. I actually didn't understand the difference between guys/girls as a kid and wore my sister's dresses when I was really young. Everytime a girl is interested in me my personality kills it, because looks mean nothing on a guy and that's usually the only reason they get interested. I have self-esteem issues arising from the fact that I've never had a girlfriend and I've accepted that I might be a virgin forever. I have no idea how to approach girls because they all give the ""I have a boyfriend"" lie and I get shot down. Unless I become an asshole and join a frat. Right?

Thank you for hosting me on 11/20/13.  Those misguided hippies at my school in Santa Cruz shut the campus down and canceled classed over a protest they can barely articulate.  It is a sad day when the minority can dictate to the majority  So did I sit in my apartment on campus and waste my time like all the other Slugs? Hell no!

270,2013-11-21 16:02:11,"oke up this morning 5:30 sharp while 4 other girls slept soundly in my room. They were too drunk from the party last night and I took them home, made sure they were okay and slept on the floor. I quickly made some old fashioned ihop breakfast for them and got some of my old clothes cause there was puke on theirs. Leaving both those things and a note on the table, I quickly left as they were waking up. I took the stairs down so the elevator wouldn't have to stop on my floor and make other people late; besides, a good morning exercise is good for you. I take my old cheapy bike and head over to the RSF. Along the way I spot a homeless person and gave him the extra breakfast I made for myself and my gym clothes I was going to change out of. He needed it more than me. When I entered, the room scent didn't change at all. I try to do my usual routine lifting and try to fit it in a hour cause hey, it's pretty optimal and so I don't hog the barbell. I made a 20 lb progress on my deadlift and was pretty proud. On the way back to the locker room, I helped a guy out who was struggling with the bench. I asked to work in with him and spot him even though I didn't plan on working chest today. I didn't want him to get hurt though. We have a solid workout and exchanged numbers so he doesn't have to bench alone next time.
I looked up, and sure enough this really cute girl was coming towards me. When i say cute, I mean that girl seemed like she loved her family, studied hard, and treated everyone around her really nicely. She asked to use the machine I was on and I delightfully obliged. I walked back to the locker room and didn't ask for her number because I respect that she was just there to workout and not get hit on. As I was about to leave I see her again getting hit on by a sleazy guy and clearly uncomfortable. I proceeded to pretend to be gay and hit on the guy and making him feel queasy. She thanked me and I left before we could talk more, she thinks Im gay but no biggie. 
 I left the gym and found my bike, which I purposely don't lock, gone. Hey, if you're desperate enough to steal, go ahead. I know a friend who knows a bike shop and I get them for really cheap anyway. On the way back I see another hobo, give him a couple dollar bills and a piece of paper that directs him to the nearest homeless shelter. Now I'm sitting here, drinking filtered tap water and eating some left over breakfast the girls didn't finish. Its 12:00 and I have to head to class."

""Look, a cute little baby squirrel!"" I shouted. His response was, ""That's not a baby squirrel. That's a fully grown squirrel. It's just normal sized."" 

Take this to heart squirrels of Berkeley. I literally thought that a perfectly average sized squirrel was an infant because you are so fucking fat.

My roommate also told me that she heard my friend making gagging noises in the bathroom a couple times which made me listen carefully the next time she was at my place. I heard the noises, too.

We're number one in a few majors like CS but as far as things like economics or pre med, the Ivys blow us out of the water. So if you're not in a major that Berkeley is #1 in, shut up about how all majors are equally hard. They aren't. 

And before you EECS kids come out of the woodwork to brag, just remember that your professor makes fun of how L&S CS majors have a higher average starting salary than you guys."

I saw you at crossroads last year. You had just rolled your ankle and you were on crutches. When you walked through the door, I thought I might offer to help you carry your food to where you were sitting to be nice, but I decided against it initially, thinking it would be weird. After about 10 minutes, I went to go get another plate of food, only to see you waiting by the sandwich area with a plate. I then went over to you and helped you to your seat. We talked for awhile and I built up enough courage and asked for your number and you gave it to me. I tried texting you a couple of times, and you never responded :(

""Oh, you're in a frat? Probably not my kind of person,"" things like that. Like, what happened to getting to know people for who they are rather than what community they associate themselves with? It makes Cal such an isolating and lonely place, in a way. I see judgments passed day to day, I see people determining who are ""their kind of people"" based on the most futile of things like the way someone dresses or looks. It's sort of disheartening. I just wish we could all be fuckin friends i don't even care if that sounds cliche too many fucking people are depressed on this campus because of the judgments allotted onto them or because once people have found their groups they decide they don't have a real need to reason to be genial or attempt to create connections with more than just the people they already know. step out of your comfort zone, love like everyone you see needs your love, because i can say that my day is always made better when someone is fucking friendly. stop hustle-bustling around campus while looking at the floor and look up and smile at your peers once and a while."

I knew it would be hard, but I decided to pursue this major after realizing that I was raped by my boyfriend of three years. On our third anniversary we were cuddling in bed. I never explicitly said ""yes,"" but he assumed that by taking off his pants and putting a condom on him that I was ""asking for it."" Men need to know that this is NOT OKAY. Needless to say, he and I are no longer together. My rape apologist lawyer told me that I ""don't have a case,"" so I think I'm going to tell my ex's friends and family about how sleazy he is, and create a blog to call him out.

What I don't agree with is people acting hypersensitive, militant, extremely politically correct over issues that are small, historic or maybe don't even exist at all. It's better for people to be as open as possible with discussing (and joking, when appropriate) their race, ethnicity, etc. with one another and take the power out of insults than constantly worry about the right term for this thing or just acting like their definition of a certain group is better than everybody else's. The truth is, people basically have the right to express anything, so inevitably someone's almost always going to be offended by something.  There are a number of issues in our society that still need to be worked on, and  just  getting butt hurt and policed over every little joke and saying alone really isn't going to do anything."

When persuing the change one wants in life, the first step is to act upon it.
But I find myself completely unable to get past step one. 
My fear and anxiety of reprocussions and negative impacts freeze me in my path.
People like to point out that we only live once, so that we should take any chance regardless. All that supportive talk never gets into my head.
I feel as if every piece of helpful advice ever given could be represented as the best armor-penetrating bullet in the world, but it will never crack past my 100% damage/bullet-proof skull.

Somehow, my mind switches into complete pessimist mode. (And no, Im dont cut my wrists or physically harm meself.)
What is also really hard to cope with is living up to the reputation that I never asked for. All the false hope that I was given back in highschool from all my supportive peers, and all the supportive families back home, it all amounts to nothing when I can't even fathom the idea of making someone out of myself. 
These problems of mine have only started to affect me when I started college last fall. I entered Berkeley believing that I would succeed in my intended major, only to find out how I couldnt keep up with the workload.
My father, who lately has been abusing his meds due to his surgery from years ago, has become a dictator. Every day I feel suppressed by his existance. 
So my failure to keep up in the prerequiste courses of my former inspiration, along with a dad-turned-madman and my mental conflicts, I cannot move on with my life. I can't even confront my parents about how I feel.
My dad will just go Mao-mode, and my mom will probably fall into depression. And I realized how horrible I've treated my mom in the past, so I do not want to make her life worse now by telling her I no longer want to persue my former dream. I know they want the best for me, to find a job and live, but I know I will never be happy with that path. 
Yet at the end of the day? It comes back to the beginning: I can't act upon it. Well, I am capable of doing it, but I am incapable of pushing myself to do it. My mindset has been so deformed that I am no longer able to be independent. 
At the eve of every day, I tell myself to take the easy way out. I know the default argument is: ""What about all of those people who care about you?"" and I completely understand it. I know it is selfish of me to even consider it, but I feel like everyone has their boundaires. I feel justified to say I just cannot handle all of this anymore. 

But at the end of the day, I find myself still living and continue to make my life a living hell.
P.S. To my friend who knows about all this, if you are reading this, please don't put me on blast. This is meant to be anonymous."
321,2013-11-20 17:51:46,"fucking hate rainy days in Berkeley. Especially those rainy days where they don't stop until 2 or 3 days later. The yucky, steaminess in a classroom full of wet people is the worst.

Thanks god for bringing him to me, too bad that I was too shy to ask for his name, just know that he's a little chubby, was on the way to Soda (guess he's CS or EECS) and with a cute Minion iphone cover and his name starts with P... I hope you are not in relationship actually :)"

Just tonight someone mentioned that I lost a lot of weight, and the connection finally clicked. 

I've been through enough experiences to know very well that I have power over who I am, but I feel the clash between this knowledge and the inability to prevent this from happening. Instead I exist within a blissful sadness, or a depressed state of joy."

329,2013-11-20 17:20:10,"oke up this morning 5:30 sharp with a blowjob from two bitches, one was trying to fit my humongous 3 pound balls in her mouth while the other was choking halfway on my 18 and 3\8 inch dick. Must have came about a quart of sperm. They wanted more, cockslapped them unconcious, I had to hit RSF. Frontflipped from my 14th floor loft into my valet parked 2012 Ferrari (I got connexions) and gave the valet 3000$ in loose change. Pushed my shit to about 4 hundo (mph, mind you) and I was at the RSF in no time. When I entered, the room scent suddently changed from sweat to wet pussy. That;s just the effect I have on hoes. Did my usual relax routine, 6000 push-ups, 8500 crunches, bench pressed 30 plates, etc. etc. you know the drill. After doing my shit in 16 minutes, my super strong senses got in action, I was smelling pussy. I looked up, and sure enough this fly honey was coming towards me. When i say fly, I mean that bitch was fine as a fucking umbrella. 18 years old, 44DD titties on a tight fucking frame. I mean a real skinny bitch, the type you losers jack off to, she didnt weigh more than 5 pounds. Took out my trouser monster and she started to squirt hard, she was convulsing and having 6 orgasms at the same time. Then I gave it to her while all the guys were giving me high fives and all the hoes were on the floor squirting like motherfucking fountains. Made the slut beg for my cum, but I didnt give it to her to prove a point, I still came but only compressed air came out, imagine your best orgasm, then multiply it by 35. Didnt say nothing, hopped back in the Lambo and went back home. Now I'm sitting here, drinking 15 000$ champagne and eating gold plated sushis made by the 2 bitches from earlier. Its only 6:30 and I did more in 1 hour than you faggots will do your whole life."

335,2013-11-20 16:58:17,"know that people who lift are kind of a running joke on the interwebz and even on this page.  I'm a pretty strong kid, so I get ""do you even lift brah?"" on a daily basis.  For many people, its a way of bettering themselves.  For some, its about making yourself look good.  For me however, its my way of escaping.

Keep in mind that for me, lifting and talking are about the only two things that I'm good at.  Can't say that I'm all that attractive, I'm smart but not a stellar student, and I've never had a million friends.  When things ever got tough, i started eating.  Eventually, I'd gained a fair bit of weight.  I wasn't ""fat"" (this was mostly due to broad shoulders and a decent amount of muscle), but I considered myself about 25lbs overweight.  Once I got to be serious about my sport however, I found lifting.  Eventually, I lost that fat, picked up muscle, and I found a new, healthier way of escaping life's issues.  Half of why I came to Berkeley however, was so that I could escape some of the friend issues that I dealt with in high school.

Which brings me to my roommates.  I absolutely love them to death, but they seriously don't know where the line is when it comes to jokes.  Often times it turns into a 2-on-1 kind of thing, and when my ex is in the room, a 3-on-1 deal.  I've told them each that its getting to be a bit much.  I wouldn't have an issue if it was more of a level playing field, but now, seeing as I'm not close to the kids on my floor, I don't have anyone in my life on a daily basis that doesn't give me non-stop shit.  Between them and school, lifting is really the only part of my week (of my day if i'm very, very lucky) that I actually feel good about myself.  I came to Cal so that it wouldn't have to be as much as an ""escape"" for me anymore.  Only now, its even more of one.

tl;dr, understand that sometimes, we don't lift to be ""bros,"" we aren't all ""curlbrah's,"" and we don't do it to feel like we are superior to those who ""don't even lift.""  Sometimes, its the only thing that keeps us from going insane."
336,2013-11-20 16:59:19,"was having brunch at Cafe 3 and there was myself, a group of white girls, and an African-American girl sitting at different tables.

So she's getting up and one of the white girls goes like ""hey you, pick up after yourself no one's here to do that for you anymore."" 

LOL all I have to say right now because that girl looked all stupid asking where the place for the dishes was; she claimed she didn't even know about it. She dropped plates and forks trying to take her plates. 

I want to thank those white girls because it's the workers who have to pick up that shit. You're in fucking college clean up after your fucking self. I'd like to see your ass pick up dirty plates, food on the floor, and clean those nasty ass plates. Be more fucking considerate!!!!"

When I came to Berkeley, I thought I'd meet more open-minded people, but instead, all I hear about are people bickering over which majors are better, how life is unfair, and how hard it is here. Honestly, Berkeley, you haven't witnessed what unfairness, injustice, and hardships really even are. Most of you are ""first-world snowflakes"" without a clue. 

So please, before you open your mouth, just think about why you need to say what you do. Stop starting shitstorms over nothing. Every major at Berkeley is available for a reason; they contribute in some way to society whether you know it or not. Every hardship you have here will only be a small part of your life. Let's just create a happier environment for this short span of time that we ""struggle"" through because it's only the beginning of your exposure to the world."

Then I'll brush my teeth and wash my face with water (all the while the bathroom is pitch black).

Where y'all at?!? I'm a brown brother myself and every time I walk, I am on a mission to find y'all. Sometimes I walk into Subway, without being hungry, and buy a 5 dollar foot-long just to be able to talk to the brown faces behind the counter. At times, during studying, I google ""latinos"" so I don't feel alone in Berkeley. I walk through the neighborhoods in Berkeley trying to catch a mexican cutting grass but sadly there isn't any. There has also been occasions when I catch myself talking to a bottle of Tapatio at Cafe 3 just to get the feeling of talking to a mexican again. What upsets me the most is that Cafe 3 always has asian themed food. That shit is boo boo! Give me some pinche tamales, burritos y tacos de carne asada, enchiladas, and pozole instead of a fucking Pho bar!!! Fuck y'all....

Point is, when a girl likes a guy, he becomes blacklisted from every other fucking girl in that sorority and it is fucking annoying. 

Because of this, the poor guy is unable to get with any girl in that sorority just because some dumb cunt wont open her mouth and talk to the fucking guy. 

If a guy likes you, and doesn't tell you, he's a moron. Don't be a moron. This is college.

And sometimes, when your hand is tangent to mine, and I can't help but notice the cusps of your nipples poking through your blouse, it induces something primal in me, some base desires, and I have to struggle to hide the expansion in my pants, the steepness of its ascent.

What enrages me even more is when people try to SELL their animals. How could they live with themselves trying to profit off of a life? It is also irresponsible and wrong for them to breed their animals, since there are so many animals that are euthanized in shelters each year due to lack of space and lack of people willing to take them in. 

Yes, I understand that people are trying to re-home the animals themselves before bringing them to a shelter, but I think they should have considered the entire life of the animal before bringing them into their home. Also, there are some shelters that do not euthanize their animals. 

I hope people will start considering whether or not they can provide a lifetime of love and care for an animal before bringing them into their home."
382,2013-11-19 18:43:47,"or some strange reason beyond my means of comprehension, I cannot stop thinking about sex. Yes, I am male. No, I am not gay. 

Ok here we go: ever since I started my junior year of college all I want is sex. I don't care who the girl is or what she looks like (as long as she is not fat... fuck that). The blood rushes to my cock and boom I fuck... but unfortunately, after about a few minutes I want to have sex again. It is only after I have ejaculated approximately 4 times (with a standard deviation of 1) that I lose my urge to have sex. But no matter what, that next day I wake up with a rock hard boner--ready to pursue my fornicating passions. 

I can't focus on school. My GPA has gone from a 3.8 to a 2.8 this semester. Currently, I'm rubbing my hard penis with my forearm as I type. It's THAT bad- - It won't stop.

No, I do not watch porn (I gave that up a while ago).... I masturbate relatively frequently without porn (definitely once a day). 

So I ask... males and females of bold Berk: do you have these issues? Do you know how to alleviate this tension formulating in my testicles? I need help. But damn... this conversation is just too embarrassing to have with my friends.... and I have a good amount of sex... according to my friends... approximately 8-10 times per week (with 4 different women right now). No, I am not in a relationship with any of them and they are all okay with me seeing other people.

Sincerely, 

A ridiculously sexually frustrated Cal student"

Also, its REALLY hard to take ASUC Senators (and people heavily involved in campus politics) seriously when every ASUC senator I know drops classes left and right or has mediocre grades because their primary focus is campus politics and not academics.

409,2013-11-19 00:06:44,". My dorm room is situated near the bathroom in my mini-suite. Yesterday morning, I heard someone turn on the shower. Then, I heard some moaning and groaning sounds which sounded oddly tinny. Knowing my suite mates and their inability to even talk to a girl without acting like a six year old, I concluded that one of my suite mates was watching porn before hopping in the shower, hoping no one would hear the sounds over the shower. After 2 minutes of this excruciating ordeal, I stormed into the bathroom and yelled that if he wanted to watch porn, he should have the decency to put on headphones and leave the rest of us to study for midterms. Now the suite mate is pissed at me, and somewhat embarrassed, as he has purposefully tried to avoid eye contact with me for the past few days. I really hope my housing transfer goes through; I can't go through this anymore.
2. The same suite mate has a crush; he tries so hard to make it known. He acts like a sixth grader when it comes to crushes; he showed me that 'because everyone always looks at my phone,' he changed the name of his crush to '------' so no one would know the name of his crush. 
3. My other suite mate is a legit fag. He and his boyfriend have started showering together. I know I shouldn't be freaked out, but I am. I'm horrified by what potentially goes on in there, and don't want to be showering in an area where a cockfest took place. I really need to move soon.
4. My OTHER suite-mate is a genetic mess. He's color-blind, has a heart condition, is asexual, is allergic to alcohol, and to top it all off, he's 5'4"" and 88 pounds. He also doesn't give two shits about his appearance, which makes me mad. I think every man should take a minimal amount of pride in keeping their appearance presentable. This suite mate tried to cut his hair the other day, and managed to drop the razor down the side of his head, leaving a bald spot on the side of his head. I urged him to go to a hair salon and get it fixed, but he said ""it wasn't a big deal"" and now walks around looking like a maniac with half of his head with a buzz cut and the other half a virtual mullet.
5. I am depressed by the lack of attractive girls here. I mean, my friend and I did a rating of the girls that entered the dining common in a period of 30 minutes, and out of 40 girls, two were worthy of a double take, translating to a 5-6 on a scale of 10. We're not even talking about HOT girls, just Attractive enough to warrant some attention. It's so sad; I don't want to lose my virginity to a girl who I will have to put a bag over her head"

439,2013-11-18 15:35:44,"ad sex in class with a feminist today.

Was in VLSB lecture hall and it was early in the morning. I had a lil morning wood and I didn't feel like listening to the professor.

So I was sitting near the back row with no one to my sides except this one pale looking nerdy Asian chick. I'm talking thick frames, tangled hair, pale skin, and hugely conservative clothing. She wasn't very attractive but she seemed like an excellent target. 

So I scooted on over to her and asked if she had the notes from last lecture. The cunt had the bollocks to say no when it was obvious she writes down every little thing the professor says. No matter, vengeance shall be mine in a few moments. 

So I lean a little closer to her but she doesn't notice yet. I continue to inch my way towards her until inches become cm's and, when I'm nearly touching her with my leg I poke her thigh with my finger. She moves her leg. I do it again a minute later. And then again. Eventually she glares at me. 

I then just put my hand on her thigh, she looks at me, I pretend to be listening to the professor and writing notes with mi otro mano. I start to stroke her thigh and she tries to push my hand off, but her Asian grip was of no use. She started to make noises, and students looked, but my quick reflexes allowed me to look like I was in intense note-taking mode.

When they turned, I rested my arm on her thigh and again she attempted to push me off. It was at this point that I realized she had some feminist sticker type thing on her backpack. Oh boy, what had I gotten myself into? I am sure to end up in prison now, so I said, ""fuck it,"" under my breath and rested my hand on her vagina. 

Interestingly, while she did try to push it away, you could tell it was a half-assed effort, it seemed like she actually did want my hand to be there, in some back part of her mind. Maybe I'm just invoking the urge that all women want, to secretly be raped. I finger my way into her jeans and start rubbing her crotch. She lets out a little moan.

Just as I thought. I quickly pulled my hand out of her pants and looked at her face, she looked at me, and those eyes craved for more. She moaned like a Japanese school girl getting molested on a bus. 

I grabbed her hand and rested it on my now 4.25"" rock hard bulge. She stroked it through my jeans and eventually put her hands down my pants, playing with my pubes and rubbing the tip of my trombone. 

At the same time, I was fingering her, and 20 minutes of this continued until I ejaculated through my jeans. I simply waited as the stain darkened among the denim until class was over. I grabbed her by the hand and pulled her into the boy's bathroom in VLSB.

It's important for a subset of individuals educated in social science work on the evaluation of society and social issues in order for us, as a collective society, to be informed when it's time to make decisions about things like policy, and realize that (believe it or not) unemployment and inflation in the aggregate economy aren't the only things that matter.

With that said, if I hear another naive cunt talk about how great Karl Marx is and how socialism is the key to ""fixing"" our society and economy, I will rip his or her fucking head off. Do you know about Marx's actual beliefs and propositions? Have you heard of China's Great Leap Forward? It's collapse?

I feel depressed. Everyday makes me fall deeper and deeper into a pit of shame and depression. Throughout high school, I was not the most popular guy at school. Sure, I had one or two girls like me, but that was all. I never had a girlfriend, never had anyone to just cuddle with and talk about stuff. I came to college looking for a girlfriend. Of course, I put grades first, and I have kept those up. But I've been trying hard: going on dates with girls, trying to expand my social group, talking to everyone, just putting myself out there. Nothing seems to be working for me; girls are always flaking on me left and right. I don't understand what's a signal of attraction; I've had too many bad experiences in the past and I'm afraid of acting too aggressive and coming off as creepy, annoying, or overbearing. I'm not the worst looking guy out there, but then again not the best.

469,2013-11-17 20:02:44,"made a typical post-gym Chipotle stop after the gym on Sunday. As I turned onto Telegraph, I saw a huge crowd outside Chipotle, and thought, “Damn. Long line today.” But after a moment I noticed they were holding signs such as “It’s not food, it’s violence,” and “Animals are people too.” The crowd was protesting Chipotle and being filmed by some local news network. I walked over and asked them what they were protesting and was met with a rehearsed spew of clichés about how I need to know where my food comes from, how corporations are evil, and intentionally practice animal cruelty. Completely unfounded crap of the sort. I asked them what they advise people to do. The response was “Stop eating animals. Everyone should be a vegetarian. Animals are not ours to eat. Trust me, you’ll feel so much better as soon as you do.”

This protest was one of the most frustrating things I’ve seen in my two years at Berkeley so far for many reasons. 

First, it is ecologically impossible for everyone to be a vegetarian. We don’t have enough agricultural land in the United States for everyone to adopt a purely vegetarian diet. If we were to expand and import, this would be far more destructive than killing animals. Agriculture is among the most destructive human practices in history. It is essentially biotic cleansing. It requires taking entire living communities and clearing them away for planting space for humans. Encouraging this mass adoption of vegetarian and veganism would do significantly more harm to the world than continuing current animal practices. 

Second, these protestors claimed that removing meat from my diet would instantly make me feel better. This is not only nutritionally false, but it is also such a wrong approach towards “saving animals.” I’ve personally known many people who are vegan here at Berkeley. I know there is a right way to be vegan, but doing it the wrong way can result in bodily harm, which I’ve also seen among my vegan friends. And removing meat from my diet so I can feel better about myself? Clearly, animal cruelty isn’t the concern here. It’s just some self-righteous circle jerk where all these people can feel good about how they’re “saving the world” by not eating animals. 

I understand that the current practices of animal slaughtering and immoral, but death is death. There is no outstandingly humane way to kill an animal. The planet would be turned into a desert in a matter of years if we had to have enough agriculture for everyone to be a vegetarian or vegan. While we can advise better practices for slaughtering animals, all these people who claim that everyone should be vegetarian/vegan really need to get off their high horses and realize that’s not at all viable.

Tl;dr: Being vegan/vegetarian doesn’t make you a superhero. Understand the implications that come with telling everyone to do the same. Protestors need to get their shit together and focus on the message of animal cruelty and how it can be avoided."

""It is if you want to get into med school. Odds are if you don't have a stellar GPA, you won't get in. You should probably go for an easier major.""

istg, this is a recurring conversation in my life. I am pretty sure I want to do Molecular and Cell Biology and if I'm going to change my major in the future ('cause, hey, I probably will), it's going to be because I realize my passion in another subject, not because I think another major is ""easier."" Why is it that people are so quick to shy away from a challenge?! We are in college, people. And even though I'm just a freshman, I'm pretty sure this isn't a place to strive to be the very best; this isn't a place to adjust your major just so you can get a better GPA. I'm pretty sure this is a place to learn. To change one's life for the better. To build a FUTURE. So honestly, I could care less if my GPA is less than ""stellar"" by the time I graduate. I could care less if med schools don't want me because my grades are subpar.

525,2013-11-16 15:59:33,"o all the girls who lift in the rsf/memorial stadium gym, thank you. you give me hope. you make me realize that not all women eat whatever the fuck they want and expect the fat behind their thighs to just magically disappear. i notice the women who lift... not in a stalkerish type of way, but in the sense that i can respect the fact that they are attempting to sculpt their bodies in a way that is not counter productive. 

so many girls i've spoken to say that they don't lift weights because they don't want to look like a guy........ you will only look like a guy if u actually produce an adequate level of testosterone.. which no girl naturally does. essentially, when a women lifts weight they get toned as fuckk... an appearance i'd say 90% of guys appreciate 

so to the women who lift i say thank you. i thank the girl i met this weekend whose ass felt firmly suitable in the palm of my hand. am i being a fucking sexist? am i being a fucking anti feminist? FUCK NO.. im just appreciating an aesthetically pleasing female body. 

so women... stop the fucking shit in the rsf that focuses solely on the elliptical or other monotonous excercise. the human body naturally adapts to the same movements (it basically finds a more efficient way of doing the same exercise)... to apply an appropriate Berkeley metaphor: you don't study the third grade your entire life... you move on to the next grade and then the next, etc. etc. because you're mind gets better... well so does you're body 

oh you have test? you have boy problems? you have insecurity issues ? get that ass in the gym and lift. guys won't judge you. they will respect the fact that you are trying to improve the  body you currently have. 

... and with this i say: 

may the gainz be with you"
526,2013-11-16 15:05:34,"etting this off my chest... I'm a fairly average looking dude, and NOBODY would guess from looking at me, but I smoke A LOT of weed. I'm not saying this to brag, but I'm sure that if there was a bong rip competion in Berkeley, I would win.

You know when people joke around saying ""smoke weed all day, er'day?"" Where I'm from and the culture I'm accustomed to, that's not even a joke. For this entire semester I was high in class. I could count the days I wasn't high on my fingers. I started my morning with a milky bowl of tobacco and herb (called a moch, fiddy, bloop, popper, mole, toaster, whatever you like to call it. If you have no tolerance to weed or tobacco, one of these would absolutely fuck you up. We used to call them comatoasters because your first one will flood your brain with pleasureable chemicals and you literally lose conciousness for a minute from the overload of pleasure, like being bathed in warm, profound vibrations. But I don't stop there, because due to the law of diminishing returns I never feel satisfied anymore. It's not like ""OMG i can't go a day without taking a bong rip"" it's more like ""hmmm yes a few more and then I'll do _____."" I would have two or three or more rips before I go to my 11 am, which has  and then spend the whole day feeling anxious and afraid of speaking to others because of my cracking voice and lack of social motivation. I never counted rips. Couldn't. I would lose track. I'm saying I would average around 20 a day, and that's a weekday.

 I'm not trying to brag, I'm being honest about how shitty my situation is. I'm saying this because, I'm the kind of person that took it too far, and I am suffering socially because of it. Like I could care less what you do with your life, but you've go to understand, there ARE people like this, and we walk among you.

 I'm not trying to brag, I'm being honest about how shitty my situation is. That's why I got rid of all my stuff. But you all should understand that for this semester, I felt like I was in a different universe than the rest of the Berkeley community because I am literally a recluse. I'm sick of feeling alienated and abject. To me, this means garnering the strength to stop. I'm fucking done smoking weed. I'm fucking done smoking weed. I can affirm that I know more about being high than any one of the braindeads that are laughing at me right now for quitting a ""harmless drug,"" so I'm gonna let you do what you do, but for me, I'm retiring. Expert gone rogue. I'm fucking done."

Holidays suck, because they are either awkward with both parents, or you spend it with one and not the other, or you're constantly running back and forth to see both sides. Plus parents get jealous...and complain to you about their problems. Stepparents and stepsiblings, parents dating random people who aren't your mom or dad...family members who take sides. My parents gave up on each other, and they play the victim card all the time. But really, the kids are the ones who hurt the most--everyone hurts, but the kids get it the worst because they are helpless to the situation."
552,2013-11-15 18:42:30,"think feminism is bringing about the downfall of society. All women have a self-entitlement complex upon birth. Eggs are biologically more valuable than sperm, and the brains of males and females have evolved to reflect this. In women, their minds are primed from birth to regard themselves as the more valuable sex, and this is true, at least in the reproductive arena. Men, however, are primed to regard themselves as less individually valuable than women, and this manifests as a willingness to take more mortal risks. Women didn't go to war for thousands of years. Women tend to shy away from high-risk jobs. 95% of workplace deaths are men. Women have the power when it comes to sex. And now that feminism is ""empowering women"", the one thing that most men traditionally had to make sure their genetic lineage went on, their ability to provide, has gone down the drain. In the old days, if a woman cheated and was found out, she could be left with nothing. Now, in the era of ""let's-give-everything-to-women-who-divorce"" laws and Obamacare, women can go out ride the cock carousel and cuckold their husbands without repercussion. Marriage used to be a retirement plan for women - as long as they stayed loyal. Now, women can be as slutty as they want, because the state doesn't care. Alimony and child support payments will keep her nicely afloat at the cost of her poor sucker ex-husband. And that child might not even be his. Feminism: giving women the upper hand because all the Aces and Kings they hold in the sexual selection market aren't enough.

I fucked a feminist on her roommate's bed today. I enjoyed making her wince in pain with every thrust during anal. Then I wiped a little bit of the shit underneath her desk when she left the room. I told her all of this when she came back. To be fair, I did feel a little bad, but only because she was cute. I guess not all feminists are ugly."

All I want is to take a girl on a date who I find interesting and she feels the same about me.  I don't want to hook up at some Friday night party and feel like a complete douche the next day.  I just want somebody that I can trust and talk to and cuddle with whenever.

Then there's me. The only person I am actually close to is probably going to end up getting an apartment with his highschool friends, and it scares me. I don't want to live on the residence halls forever and it scares me so much and makes me cry almost every time I think about it. In fact, I'm on the verge of crying now. I don't know what to do.

There are a million little strings attached to every choice you make; you can destroy your life every time you choose. But maybe you won't know for twenty years. And you may never ever trace it to its source. And you only get one chance to play it out. Just try and figure out your own divorce. And they say there is no fate, but there is: it's what you create. And even though the world goes on for eons and eons, you are only here for a fraction of a fraction of a second. Most of your time is spent being dead or not yet born. But while alive, you wait in vain, wasting years, for a phone call or a letter or a look from someone or something to make it all right. And it never comes or it seems to but it doesn't really. And so you spend your time in vague regret or vaguer hope that something good will come along. Something to make you feel connected, something to make you feel whole, something to make you feel loved. And the truth is I feel so angry, and the truth is I feel so fucking sad, and the truth is I've felt so fucking hurt for so fucking long and for just as long I've been pretending I'm OK, just to get along, just for, I don't know why, maybe because no one wants to hear about my misery, because they have their own. Well, fuck everybody. Amen."

605,2013-11-14 18:41:17,"o, I'm an MCB student, but I'm not pre-med. I'd like to say that a lot of the pre-meds in my classes actually don't get much out of the classes required for our traditionally ""pre-med"" major at all.

I am passionate about science and love learning anything that pertains to science, which is why I chose this major. I thought that college was supposed to be a place where we explore our passions and get to delve into a particular subject that fascinates us.

I think it's a shame, though, that a lot of the people in my major care VERY little for the actual subject matter of the courses required for it. They care only about a letter grade on paper and will simply memorize tons of information and regurgitate it on tests, then completely forget it.

I understand that they need to care a lot about their grades for medical school admissions, but from my experience I can sufficiently say that if you are passionate enough about the actual material of a certain course and apply yourself to it simply out of this passion, then a good grade will probably come naturally. I think this is true for all areas of study and all majors. That's how learning should be. That memorization and regurgitation cycle just makes me a little sad...

It's even more sad that MCB has become this distinctly ""pre-med"" major that everyone flocks to as a good way to prepare for medical school and that most of these people don't give two shits about molecular and cell biology."

614,2013-11-14 03:34:32,"here's a certain poeticness to college.

Here are all of us: thousands of us. We come from lots of places with lots of experiences and lots of interests; diversity defines us so much that it's used to advertise the school we attend. 

And yet, even though our school prides itself on our diversity, it seems like that's just what society wants to destroy. As aforementioned, there are many academic interests at Berkeley: One person wants to study English, another Mathematics, another Molecular and Cell Biology, some EECS, Gender and Women's Studies, Physics, Rhetoric, Political Science, Anthropology... You name it, someone is studying in it here. However, to many of these, society simply says ""no.""

And it says ""no"" because the world is ruled by flimsy paper bills and tiny metal coins.

You want to study English? ""No. There's no job, you'll have to be a, oh dear... a TEACHER!"" You want to study Ethnic Studies? ""No. What could you possibly do with that?"" Rhetoric, Psychology, Music, Art History? ""No, where's the money??""

Society says ""yes"" to the studies that lead to the jobs that create the green. Pre-Med? ""Yes!"" Pre-Law? ""Yes!!"" Engineering? ""Oh, yes, please!""

We pride ourselves and our school on diversity, and yet that's exactly what our society is trying to ruin. Society has conditioned us to think not in terms of passion, or interest, but to think in terms of money and to call it ""thinking logically about our futures.""

I want to know when ""thinking logically"" stopped meaning picking what you're going to study based on what you're going to ENJOY studying. There's nothing wrong with people studying these ""green-making majors"" if you enjoy them, but it's upsetting that so, so many people are studying what they are just to have a ""good job.""

Not to mention–the terror of knowing that many of our society's future engineers, doctors, and lawyers will not be motivated by the prospects of solving problems, saving lives, and fighting for justice, but instead by paychecks with a greater distance between the dollar sign and the decimal point."

You may study for two hours a day, NOT THE WHOLE FUCKING THREE DAY WEEKEND (pretty sure I saw one of you sleeping in there). I'm sure you have other places to study/ people to annoy.

2. Please do not leave your trash on our study room tables!! It is very disrespectful, ESPECIALLY IF YOU DO NOT LIVE IN SAID BUILDING. Residents have had to clean up after you dirty people!!! As guests, you should have more respect for our space. I am assuming you are at least 18+ years of age, therefore you are an adult, and ALSO you go to Cal so I'm assuming you have a certain level of intellectual capacity. PICK UP AFTER YOURSELVES.

I fantasize about physically controlling and forcing into submission women, and the idea of emotionally controlling someone turns me on.  I know that ""BDSM"" is a thing, but I could never enter into a relationship based off sadomasochism, because as a modern man I find sexism abhorrent and support gender equality.  If others want to consent to do those things, that's fine, but I can't accept myself dong that. Even a nonsexual relationship scares me because my dominant personality is so pervasive that I worry I would be a terrible boyfriend for whoever would be dating me.  Even in friendships or classes, I'm dominant and cow others into (in this case intellectual or conversational) submission.  I'm happy I have a strong conscience and ethical grounding but it can be tough, especially at this age, to force oneself into singlehood.  However, I'd rather be lonely and single than allow myself to jump into our permissive and abusive culture that discards women and treats them like objects (see Gray, Fifty Shades of)."

And as normal, sane, straight girls do, we went out all day and partied all night, and goddamn there were no men, NO MEN that could quench our thirst. I even pointed out some of the guys that I thought were (barely) cute, and my girls gave me the reality check that I desperately needed... they saved me from sleeping with a sleazy 3 or 5/10, which I'm sure I would have totally regretted and I would throw up a little bit if I ever thought of it (or the hideous guy)..

If the government banned all cosmetic products, they would be the first ones to set themselves on fire so that people couldn't see how ugly they really look like under all those layers of foundation, concealer, powder, eyeshadow, and blush. The funny thing is that most of them still don't look better than a 6/10 with all that makeup on. 

It's superficial and gross, really, apart from the xenophobia they hold that compels them to hang out exclusively with that one just as xenophobic Asian fraternity. It's no wonder that the rest of the fraternities and sororities on campus won't give a shit about them, because those Asian Greek organizations are in their own little made-up world."

I understand that some people here aren't necessarily consumed with maximizing salary (and props to them for following their passion), so this message is not tailored to them. Honestly, though, in many major fields (consulting, investment banking, certain sciences, accounting, politics) Berkeley is regarded as a half-step or a whole tier below schools that many people here like to consider ""peer schools,"" so it's absolutely important to excel while here."

680,2013-11-13 03:17:45,"'m fucking done with all this racism and sexism movement bullshit. I grew up in a conservative neighborhood, but went to a highly liberal, mixed high school about an hour away and you know what I've noticed in the time I spent there?? Nobody gives a legitimate fuck about that shit anymore! The only people stressing the importance of racism/sexism or getting worked up over it are insecure people and pretentious ""socialites."" And while there are many cures to insecurity and cocky peppiness, I don't believe that the race/sexism discussions will solve anything. 
Now don't get me wrong. I believe in and cherish equal rights as much as the next American, but this is utter bullshit. Do you want to know how to cure ""racism""? Stop talking to about it. ""But white people have.."" ""But black people.. "" No. No, just stop. By pointing out demographic ""flaws"" you're only making it a lot worse. You're discriminating against yourself as a human by panicking that you're being discriminated upon by race. I've shared this view before with my peers and many have called me ""ignorant"" and ""selfish"" for overlooking cultural positions. But - what cultural positions? I understand you feel obliged to have an identity tied to your roots - (ex. young, underrepresented woman from Nigeria) - but guess what? You live in America now. And for heaven's sakes, you go to Berkeley. And I'm not saying that being attached to an identity is bad - rather, it's something you should be immensely proud of! I'm just saying that it's not something to create campuswide issues about. I mean, Berkeley spends thousands of dollars every year on our African American/Native American/etc theme programs since so many underrepresented students don't feel comfortable here, among a sea of people that don't look anything like them. 
This is cultural attitude problem, if anything. C'mon. It's the 21st century. Why do looks even matter any more? Why does it matter if ""only"" 38 people in the UCLA freshman class this year are black? Why does it matter if I'm brown, black, white, red, blue, or purple? I'm a human being, just like you, with real veins and blood and plasma and cells. Why do we still actively discriminate while talking about social equity? Just stop talking about it. Look past the skin color and ethnicity; accept people for who they are - People. Not a black person. Not a native american person. Not an asian person. Simply, a person. 

(I know most of you are going to shit all over this, talking about how ironic and hypocritical it is that I'm talking about this when I clearly argue to do otherwise; it's just that I'm sick of this shit and didn't know  a better place to confess something that's been on my mind lately.)"

Next time you see your friend talking to a guy, let them do their thing. There is nothing more annoying than when two people are talking at a party and some dumb bitch comes up and pulls them away because she is too insecure to find someone.

The problem is, you have a boyfriend.  And I wish that it was me and not him.  I love being such good friends with you, but I have an enormous crush on you and sometimes I feel as if you feel the same way about me.  I can talk to you about anything and you know that you can do the same with me.  But this is one thing that I have been reserved about.  There have been plenty of times that I've wanted to kiss you and show you how much I really care for you, but I've refrained because I respect you too much and the fact that you're in a relationship.  I also don't want to damage our friendship if this was the wrong move.

You had mentioned something about taking chances and to put myself out there.  I was about to completely spill everything to you because I was sure that you knew that it was you I was thinking about, but then you mentioned something that made me think you really had no clue.  And so I refrained again in fear that you would take my confession the wrong way.  

You just brighten my world. When you smile and laugh I can't help but do the same because that's when you're most beautiful.  Your eyes sparkle and your smile lights up the room.  It gets me every time, time and time again. 

I'm getting to the point to where I feel like I'm just going to tell you everything. In person. About how you make my heart melt when you wish me luck with everything I have to do, and how we laugh about the same stupid things that everyone else probably thinks we're idiots for laughing at.  And basically everything that I've said in this post. You deserve to hear it, because you're that incredible to me."

My parents are probably disappointed in me. I haven't had any fun at all during my time here. Never went to a party, never had a girlfriend. All I did was try and study this bullshit material, just to get shitty grades. whereas all my friends were partying and getting great grades and are now going to enter med schools. I'm actually really really jealous...but I guess I am just a stupid person. You know, I actually liked biology, and this is why I stuck with it, but now I realize that was a horrible decision. I'm a failure, and I don't know what to do with my life anymore. Whatever, I just needed to get this out there...."

And alimony? Marriage is like a shit deal for men because a woman can cheat, have a bastard, divorce her husband and make him pay child support while she moves in with the real father. But nobody around me has the balls to stand up with me against the politically correct mentality. Woman can get away with doing almost anything in society.

Was walking to class and I saw this Asian chick, 5'2, A cup breasts, pancake booty. She was carrying a Math 1a/1b book with her and carrying a purse. But something else caught my eye, she was wearing shorts, peculiar shorts. What was peculiar about these shorts is that they were so short that they revealed part of her panties below, as well as some of her pancake shaped ass cheeks.

For some reason, this gave me a raging boner. I immediately ran to her and told her to pull down her shorts. There are children in the vicinity taking a look at the campus. She didn't speak a lick of English, so I grabbed her and pulled her into the bushes and told her to pull down her shorts and motioned her to do it by pretending to pull down my pants.

Apparently she got the wrong idea and pulled her shorts all the way down and started touching herself in front of me. I did what any noble American would do when faced with an international. I smashed and dashed."

739,2013-11-12 16:24:44,"his is my confession as a hall staff member: sometimes I hate residents. I hate that I hear complaints about having to move out at 10am even though it's that early because staff members can't go home until we check every single room in the building--and sometimes that means starting at 10am has us leaving by 5pm. That it's unfair to be written up because there was no warning even though to be given a warning is a courtesy and not a requirement. That signing in guests is all fine and dandy throughout the year, but when it's still required during move out everyone shits a brick (including the parents that think security for their kid is SUPER important). And I get upset when someone vandalizes flyers because even though it's something that is just printed on paper and could be reproduced, it took me an hour and a half to make the template because I do have standards on quality, and it took me another half hour to put up all the flyers throughout the building. I hate most of all when I hear someone talking down on one of my co-workers. You can have an opinion on your RA, PA, TPA, etc. But keep in mind that we are human beings too. So just pause for a moment before you start talking about how so-and-so is a bitch for writing you up for drinking because you probably didn't know that to NOT write you up could mean losing their job (a job that allows some of us to even be able to afford to go to Cal). #RantOver

This is my second confession as a hall staff member: in the end, I am truly thankful to work with residents and hall staff across the system. I have made so many friends and unique experiences that I know I wouldn't have been able to get in any other job. As many WTF type stories I have about residents, I also have stories about how residents have impacted me. That note you left on my door? I put it up near my desk so I can remember that some of my actions do matter. That surprise birthday party for someone on the floor that you invited me to? I was grateful to be included. Every time you tell me thank you, I glow inside because it means you care too.  I have grown as a person, met my best friends, and bonded with others despite diversity/challenges because I am a staff member and because you as a resident have allowed me to be a part of your Cal experience. I may bitch and moan, but I wouldn't continue with this job if I didn't think it was all worth it in the end."

757,2013-11-12 02:03:20,"am an International student from a developing country in Asia, and the previous posts about majors have made me decided to type this post.  Coming from a country where poor people are really poor and rich people are very rich, I am aware of how privileged I am.  Both my parents are very racist people, and so living at home, seeing how cruel they treated the maids, while being so nice to me was really a torture.  Three years ago, when I got into Cal’s College of Engineering, they were extremely happy, and had already plan out my entire future after graduating from Cal for me.  I have always been a pretty good student at STEM, but in my high school, almost every student is very good at math and science, I know I am just lucky plus my parents are one of the few that can support their children to study abroad.  

Sorry, let me go straight to my point.  Freshman year in Cal was really relaxing, the classes for my major weren’t really that challenging but fun.  I was so sure that I would probably just double in EECS/MSE, as my parents wanted me to, until I took a non-major lower div class in my sophomore year – Development Studies 10 with Professor Michael Watts.  Professor Watts’ lectures were so inspiring, that even though I got my first B at Cal from that class (as you can probably tell, my English is terrible, can’t really speak in discussion, plus I have really bad essay writing skill), I started to have this “terrible” idea of switching major.  To all the native speakers in that class, it must be an easy A, not because the materials were easy, but Professor was kind enough to make most of the readings optional, so if you were taking the class just for requirements, you could have good grade without studying too hard, but if you are serious into help making the world become a better place, optional readings help you to understand a lot of deeper about how inequalities in different part of the world were build up and grow.  

After a year of internal struggling, I am now double majoring in Development Studies & Political Science, with terrible GPA, cause I still speak little to none during discussion sections and write terrible essays.  The worst thing is, I still don’t have the courage to tell my parents that I actually switched college and majors to the “useless ones”, and I’m not planning to tell them until I graduate, once thing is done, it’s done.  All my friends think that’s a terrible decision that I made, and yes, I kind of agree.  I don’t know why I am choosing the majors that most people would consider easier than my previous majors, and even worse when I am actually super bad at doing readings, writing and speaking in English (we should just study what we are best at, isn’t it?).  The thing is, there are so many talented and smart people in the STEM fields already (at least in my country, since in many developing countries, that is one of the few ways to become wealthy - doctor/lawyer/engineer, choose one), when there are so little educated people who care enough to solve the government corruption problems and fight and speak for the bottom billion. 

 I don’t know how to conclude my thought, so let me just type my last few sentences…  I found it sad and funny the same time that people are arguing about which majors are more superior to the others.  Your parents did not give you that smart brain to just show off on facebook and look down at others.  If you are that smart, good for you for having the opportunity to find out how talented you are instead of fighting starvation throughout your childhood.  If you are that such, don’t you think it would be such a waste if you don’t try to make a good and huge impact on this planet instead of just use your super intelligent brain as a show off object?  Can we just all think less about individual success and more about human beings/ mother nature’s future as a whole? Thanks for reading, and hope you understand my Engrish."

Also, do it out of your heart, don't expect to gain something in return - because life feels better that way.

We will discuss the details of the intercourse over private messages, but here are some rules: this will not be a threesome, condoms are optional, you must completely agree to keeping our identities in the dl and you must be STD free.

Due to the obviously physical implications of this post, I assume many will be interested in knowing more about how we look physically. Don't worry, I am in a Fiji and my gf is in KKG (if this serves as any reference).

Anyone interested?"

772,2013-11-12 01:50:47,"y biggest fear is when my ex-boyfriend finds his next target. Although he has dated someone right after we broke up, I'm still scared every time he seems to have a new target. What I fear is being jealous of the relationship that he will be forming with someone else. Even though I know I should let go and we have been close friends since college started, it's hard to let go. Right now, I just want to be friends and be there for him. But I am scared of the day when he starts chasing after someone else, because I know it would devastate me. Honestly, the reason why it has been so hard to move on is because I do care about him and I do love him. It's hard for me to find someone else when I don't want a rebound."
773,2013-11-12 01:41:48,"o the overly politically correct, post-modern girl,

Say the word ""slave"" sometime. It sure is a word, isn't it? Sure, it's got some negative connotations, but wouldn't be really handy to use that word sometimes? Like, say, if you were in a history discussion on the goddamn 18th century slave trade? It sure would make the conversation really fucking choppy and difficult if you were to pause awkwardly every time a normal person would say the words ""slave"" or ""black"" and instead substitute with ""the people who were unfortunately in that situation"" and ""people with darker skin"" and everything else. 

Now I know you're so afraid of being ostracized by your white and asian classmates (and the one person with darker skin who is, in fact, from India), but I don't think anyone is going to assume that you're a racist land owning elite who whistles Dixie while oppressing minorities with one hand and denying the right to vote with the other just because you said a word which fucking happened historically. Instead, everyone's going to think that you're too scared to leave your bubble of ""Everything involving racism shouldn't be talked about, other than it's bad"" like every other white suburbanite who feels guilt over something their ancestors didn't even do."

776,2013-11-11 22:05:53,"ot into a fist fight with a feminist today. 

at school today, in front of sproul. A group of feminists were protesting about equality and crap like that.

They said, to repay for years of inequality, 20% of all male's earnings should go towards women. Dead serious.

They also said that women should have to pay less for food and men should have to pay more to make up for the 100's of years of inequality and that this should go on for 100's of years.

I asked the leader if she even knew what equality was and she said it's when everyone is treated equally and fairly. And I asked how the f*** is this fair? I wasn't alive 100's years of ago. I never did anything to you, why the f*** should I pay more? And she said that even though you weren't alive, you still benefit from the social prestige of being a male.

At this point I was furious, and I told her you know what else needs to be socially acceptable as equality? A man and a woman getting into a street fight. She was flabbergasted and became very irate and scolded me for even thinking of hitting a woman and how it's very disrespectful. I told her to shut her fat face up and she slapped me.

I immediately countered with a right upper cut into her gut and tore a piece of her blouse. She immediately bent over, grasping her gut in pain like Vegeta when Goku punched him in the stomach. She tried to fight back but I delivered an axe kick to the back of her head and she went down unconscious.

I really taught her what equality meant that day."

That I think about you when I'm in class and I wonder if you think about me. That when I look at you, I dream about my future and I wonder what if... 

I think I see you clearly for who you are: a boy that cares, works hard, sings when he enters a room, and is driven by the need to help others. I showed you my fears and instead of being driven away by my insecurities, you showed me yours and we became stronger together.

These are the reasons why I try to see you every day.  

But I don't think you know my reasons for wanting to be near you. Once, I was with you and I wished you would just kiss me. You paused and asked me what I was thinking about. I said nothing and then you left. I cried in my room for two hours after that as I realized how lonely I can be with and without you. 

I guess all this doesn't matter since I hear you like someone that isn't me. So I won't tell you these things. Because I know too well that unrequited love can tear two people apart no matter the good intentions behind the confession."

I eat what I like but I simply don't have enough time in the day to eat as large a portion or even as frequently as I want to. Even when I do eat really bad, like the three month period where I used to consume on average 2 chocolate bars a day, I never gained any weight. I was still underweight. That said, I get really tired of comments from people about how I'm so scrawny that they could break my arm without trying. This sorts of comments usually come from my friends are significantly larger than me. I brush it off but it makes me feel sick and uncomfortable because these people have no idea how I struggled with bulemia in the past and how only until recently did I lose a lot of weight and begin to feel anxious about not weighing ""enough"". I have a better body image than I used to, but it's still pretty warped. I'm all for body positivity but why is it something reserved only for ""fat"" people?

Hanging out with her is like when you finally dislodge food that was stuck between your teeth for hours, but lasts the entire time you're with her, not just that moment when you dislodge the food. Her licking my face to wake me up in the morning to take her out to pee is the equivalent of pounding a liter of coconut water after a night of drinking. On particularly cold nights, cuddling with her warms me up like taking a shot after doing a door shift in January. One time, I took a bite of pizza but didn't bite the cheese hard enough so when I pulled the slice away, the cheese didn't separate with the bite and dragged the cheese off the entire slice, effectively leaving me with a piece of dough and marinara sauce; it was awful but then I looked at my dog and it was all better.

At first I didn't notice she was an chick from the back because of that pancake booty, but I see her turn to the side, and dear God, I saw tits that would make Allah himself ban rape in his countries just to get a gander at.

The habibi had to be mine. When she turned around again, I tapped on her shoulder, and I waited a few seconds and nothing. I guess she brushed it off. I tapped her on the back this time (and actually pinched a little bit of her bra HNNNNG), and she turned to the side, looked at me, and quickly faced the other direction. I guess she thought she was feeling things because as she turned around I put myself in an idle position that seemed like I had done nothing and didn't want to attract her attention.

So this time, I finally just grabbed her shoulder and tugged her my way and said, ""Hey what's up, gawjus, you gonna grab the samurai surf and turf? I've been waiting ages for that.""

Ignoring my question, she replied, ""What do you want?""

""I was just asking if you were going to get the samurai surf and turf! I hear it has 20g of protein in 200 calories and it's really nutritious!""

""Oh, no. Bye, I'm next in line.""

""Wait!! Can I get your number?""

Once you graduate from Berkeley, find a job, start a family, and start interacting with adults...you will have a hard time fitting you if you say anyone who's not an EECS, engineering, biology, or computer science is below you. Humanity majors are not taking those classes for a grade point average boost. We take those classes simply because they spark our interest and unlike someone of you, we actually have the nerve to reach out and pursue what we LOVE, instead of conforming to society and just doing  a major because it will get us a good job.

I said, ""Yeah, I agree, but they could have put more sauce."" She said, ""Yeah.""

Then she slowly started to scoot over but I noticed and asked her what her major was. She said Anthropology. I was waiting for her to ask about me but she never said anything so I said, ""Cool, I'm a Pre-Haas major.""

Few minutes go by, no more talking and she starts to get up and then I ask for her number... she didn't even acknowledge me, grabbed her stuff, and left.

839,2013-11-11 01:25:10,o about 3 or so weeks ago I broke up with my boyfriend. We were dating for about a year. The whole long distance relationship in college (he goes to college in florida) was so hard for both of use. The hardest part is that neither of use cheated on one another or did anything to make this relationship bad. I know this might sound crazy but I actually really miss him. I know that I broke up with him but I still really love him and miss him. He was the perfect guy that any girl could ask for. He always treated me with so much respect. He would never do anything to hurt me. The thought of him getting and sleeping with other girls just breaks my heart. Even though we go to different schools and he probably won't be reading this I still want him to know that I love hime and truly miss him.

In discussion today we had a group project where he had to each write a paragraph about A Good Man Is Hard To Find. I was grouped up with a muslim chick (yes she had the doorag on her head and all), and 2 other guys. She was kind of cute, but I couldn't fully see her face.

Regardless, I still took the chance. Practice is practice.

When we grouped up, I assumed leadership and assigned which motifs that each person should analyze in a single paragraph. I told the muslim girl to specifically analyze every man and specifically discuss the inherent flaws.

After we completed the tasks and finished early, I asked her, ""What do you like to do for fun? Do you party?""

She quickly looked up at me with a bewildered stare and her head motioned as if she were saying, ""Umm... hello... can you see what I'm wearing? Obviously I don't party.""

She soon replied and said in a sad mumble, ""No...""

I could tell she felt trapped and actually did want to party. But I also don't party, so I replied with, ""Same here. It isn't very fun. We should get together some time. Grab a drink, perhaps?""

Again with a sigh of disappointment she replied, ""I don't think so.""

I asked if she wanted to do anything. She again replied, ""Nope.""

I was told numerous times that I'd be better off in community college despite my hard work, and my biggest fear coming here was going unnoticed the way I had been in high school and middle school. But since coming to Cal, I've made many more great memories and friends here in the last 3 months compared my whole life back at home. I've been able to support myself and pay a fair amount of my tuition through work despite being told I'm not capable of taking care of myself. I volunteer with the most amazing children who give me every reason to be where I am and stay there. And when I'm done with my 3-4 years here, I'm going to get a master's in occupational therapy so I can help those with special needs lead better lives like I've been able to. I might have a ""disability"", but I've been able to do many more things here than I ever thought possible otherwise. I still have hard days now and then, but I can surely say coming to Cal has been the best decision I've ever made. I've never loved my life more than I do right now, and more than anything else I want to use my intelligence and talent to change the world for the better."

Whenever I get hurt or feel threatened, I can dial 3 little numbers. If I have a rash, I only have to rub a little medicine and keep it clean with the water I have. I can watch a football game from a television. I can walk 2 blocks down the street to buy a doughnut late at night. I can type this message down on a computer with access to the internet. I have a heated room, clean socks, etc. to ""survive"" the cold days. Don't even get my started on how much my parent's love me. I can keep going on and on about how happy I am with what I see as ""little"" privileges.

864,2013-11-10 22:27:49,"wo cops were involved in an altercation outside my apartment on Durant. It was late at night, probably around 12 am. Two cops suddenly emerged upon the streets, bruised up and hungry for blood. As I ran to look out my window I saw crowds of people rushing out into the streets to see what was going on. What they saw were two cops ready to kill each over what appears to be a brief case. The white cop had the other black cop held up, and said he's going to collect the brief case for evidence while the black cop said he's gonna get the gun lying on the floor and then he's gonna get the money. I suspect the briefcase contains money.

The black cop truly believes the white cop won't shoot him and he'll be able to pick up the gun, get the money, and get outta there. So as the black cop advances for the gun, the white cop shoots him in his ass. The white cop means business and makes it clear that the next shot will kill the other cop. The white cop then asks the other cop if he wants to go home, the other cop says yeah, he wants his money so he could go home. The white cop takes off the black cop's badge and said he doesn't deserve to wear it.

Alarmingly, one of the crowd member's picks up the gun and points it at the black cop and says the white cop can go on and bounce. The white cop picks up the briefcase and departs from our suburban ghetto. The black cop was furious, he said he's going to put cases on everyone in the crowd, sending them to Pelican Bay under 24 hour lockdown, forcing the SHU program on them. Feeling legitimately threatened, the crowd dispersed and what was left was an injured black cop who also fled the scene."

First of all, I just want to make it clear that I am not completely against the Stanford-Berkeley rivalry; I think a friendly rivalry can be great. However, some people just take it too far! For example, I believe it to be completely disrespectful that during the national anthem at football games some people yell ""blue"" over the lyrics' ""red."" Yes, red is the color of our rival school but that doesn't mean that absolutely every instance of the color in life must be associated with them. I personally find this insulting and disrespectful to the national anthem and everything it stands for. It might not mean much to you but to some people it actually means a lot."

920,2013-11-09 16:21:45,o the amazing girl who rescued my phone out of the stream that runs next to Cesar Chavez after it was stolen out of my hands and smashed into the ground by my ex boyfriend you are a hero. The way you anonymously went out of your way to help a total stranger gives me faith that there really are good people in this world. I do not know how I could ever repay you.
921,2013-11-09 16:02:46,"hese are my confessions. Just when I thought I said all I could say, my chick on the side said she got one on the way. These are my confessions. Man I'm thrown and I dont know what to do. I guess I gotta give part 2 of my confessions If I'm gonna tell it then I gotta tell it all. Damn near cried when I got that phone call. I'm so throwed and I don't know what to do."
922,2013-11-09 16:20:47,"o here is the skinny,

I am a senior year, the time when I should have everything figured out. However, that’s not the case. I know not what I will do with my life. I am pissed and confused. Pissed at myself for not being like my peers who have full-time offers, internships, etc. lined up. And its my fault to be honest, I am too damn afraid. I am afraid of what is happening to me. I am afraid of reality coming in one day and curbstomping me for not having a plan. 

I am afraid all the time. Each morning I am afraid if I will survive the next day. Afraid of being alone. Afraid that despite the friends I have helped over my time here I am alone. I see people walking up and down Sproul with their friends happily chatting away their time here. Yet I am here stuck thinking: What the fuck. But I keep moving on, isolated from the world with my earbuds I keep walking through crowded roads of Berkeley completely alone. 

I keep a good face, 9 out of 10 days I shrug it off and move on. I smile at work because that’s a part of my work description. But the moment I clock out all the lonesomeness and pain comes back. Those feelings are like vultures, they never leave me, they seek my weakest moments and they are merciless when they strike. 
I don’t want to be a burden to my friends, I don’t want them to say, “Here they go again, asking for help etc. etc.” I don’t know how many times I have run away from people closest to me. So I run away, away from my friends, afraid that they will do the same to me if I dare to come closer. 

So I am angry, at myself, at reality, at the fact that I am wasting the precious little time I have here at Cal. The clock is a ticking and yet here I am. Feeling worse than junk, knowing that the front I put up most of the time is but a charade put on for the audience of none. 
So I search for salvation in distraction, work in the library till the little house during the week, and while others drink to celebrate, well, you know the rest. 

And I know that once I wake up, again I will be dragging myself out of the gutter, somedays I succeed, somedays I fall all the way back."
923,2013-11-09 16:56:48,"ometimes I take a dump in the bathroom and then I don't flush. I come back a few hours later just to see people walk into that same stall, see my shit, and then walk out in disgust. It makes me so horny."
924,2013-11-09 16:47:49,"'m a 19 year old girl who's 5'4, black hair, hazel eyes, pale, a toned body. I don't know why but I've always been into older men. About 1-7 years older than me. Maybe because I can't stand men my age, there so childish and annoying. I love smart, tall, intelligent, gentlemen, and you have to be funny. (Scruff/beards are a huge plus!) I'm just curious is there any guys who like younger women my age? Lately all the great older guys are taken with someone their age or maybe they don't want or have the courage to be with an underclassmen?"
925,2013-11-09 16:10:50,"I was walking outside Hearst Mining Circle after just receiving my midterm. I hastily pocketed the blue book in my bag. Just as I was descending the steps outside, I saw two girls high-fiving each other with laughter. I felt anxious about my score, not having taken a peek. They said, ""You got a 10 on all of them?"" ""Me too!"" I felt like crawling into a corner after seeing them rejoice. I got home, looked at my grade, and to my relief, I got an A. The twist, those girls actually FAILED (10 points each was a D at best). They were rejoicing in their shared failure. So much for academic insecurity at Cal.”"

928,2013-11-09 16:16:57,"verytime I go to room 206 to see my boyfriend, all I think of is you, watching your cooking shows and shit like that.

Seriously, Yash Attal, you make me so fucking wet everyday."
929,2013-11-08 22:35:10,"'ve been reading peoples' struggles about being Chicano or about job insecurity with certain majors and I can relate. I may not have had those type of problems but I have suffered as well. I am a blonde hottie with huge boobs, a big butt, and huge curves. I've always had it easy because guys always treat me well since they want to sleep with me. A lot of things were just handed to me in life for being beautiful and that's not a good thing! I became very narcissistic because I thought I was the most beautiful and intelligent girl in the world. Now I'm getting really tired of being every guy's object of desire! It gets old very fast! I've dated some swimmers from Stanford and a guy from Harvard's Rugby team but I don't think they ever liked me for who I really am. I'm so afraid that I'm never going to find a genuine guy who loves me because of my personality. I've actually become really insecure now and I stopped dating anyone. It has been more than a year and I still haven't dated anyone nor had anymore sex. I'm just too afraid now and insecure about the way in which men perceive me. I'm pretty sure most of the Berkeley guys look at me and think I'm just a hot blonde without any brains even though I've always been driven to succeed."

So I've been only masturbating to lesbian porn for the past few years and recently when I saw my roommate asleep I felt an urge to kiss her and more. Does this mean I'm a lesbian?

I admit, the UC system choosing her is pretty silly and illogical, but let's see what she does before we jump down her throat. 

Hell, she's already allocated a 5 million dollar fund (where that money is going to come from, I still don't know...) for undocumented students. Isn't that somewhat of a decent start? I swear some students just like ACTING like they're making a difference in the world, instead of actually tackling real issues we all face. They focus on shit that doesn't matter in the long run. You need the grades and stats to be here, and it's been proven that your citizenship doesn't matter. Stop bitching and get to work."

944,2013-11-08 19:11:32,"y love for this school is unconditional. I grew up in a Latino/Hispanic community, and being introduced to such diversity has really opened my mind. I've learned to interact with so many people of different backgrounds and I can honestly say it's one of the most interesting experiences I have ever came across in my life.Point is, I'm loving this school and the people in it. This University was my first choice since 9th grade, and I can assure that I will give it my 110% to make my school and family proud, as a MCB/Pre-med major, but most importantly, as a BEAR! We Latinos/Hispanics are one of the most humble and generous races. We work really hard to gain respect from everyone. Trust me, I've been to work with my dad(he does flooring), and I don't know how he can handle it.Waking up at 4 a.m. every day, being on your knees the whole time and lifting heavy roles of carpet and heavy boxes of tiles is truly a b@#$%. But what sucks even more is the salary he's receiving that isn't worth doing the labor work for. But he still does it. To provide for his family. And this goes to many other races as well that face different struggles, but don't gain the respect they deserve. That includes asians, caucasians, african/african americans, native americans, etc. Well have a great evening everyone. Do your best in all your classes. I know it can be really tough at some points, but just keep in thought that its freaking hard but not impossible. Much love to all my fellow BEARS.

Sincerely, 
The mysterious Mexican American guy. lol.

P.S. All is well."

Berkeley, has opened me to a world where I interact with the rich, the 'cultured', the 'well-traveled' I even fucked a Stanford professor the other day, instead of a dead-beat gangster back in my hometown. and unlike that rich girl/guy from previous posts I AM NOT EATING RAMEN ANYMORE! 

What I am really trying to say is thank you Berkeley for the opportunity to find value in myself. This goes to that asshole from previous posts, I feel sorry for you, you must be under so much stress, your psyche is fucked, you must be so confused but appear to have it together because of your 'major' hope you find peace. 

Chican@/ or any other major that ends in studies - keep going, I am sure you are finding value in your education. 

In conclusion, thank you, thank you thank you. God bless the UC and God bless the people surviving their struggles everyday. THANK YOU."

For 15 minutes you pretend you're completely mine only to wrap yourself with another girl each time. Your dangerous kisses I desperately avoid but my stupid heart gets scared of you being annoyed. Annoyed by a screaming brain of consciousness that attempts to get rid of my stupid heart's tolerance.

989,2013-11-08 13:42:10,"hicanos Part 2:

I wrote the original piece on my outrage/generalization against Chicanos who choose ""useless"" majors. After reading some of the more thoughtful responses, I want to tell you that I learned a lot, and after reflecting, I wanted to thank you for changing my perspective:

It is incredibly hard to be inspired at a young age toward education, regardless of socioeconomic standing. Add in the dangerous environment, poverty, social pressure, problems at home, supporting one's family, helping raising younger siblings, etc. and the chances become evermore bleak. Add in the lack of educational resources, guidance from parents who have learned educational best practices and basic infrastructure set up for student success and the chances become everMORE bleak.

I commend you all who made it this far: gaining access to the top public university in the world.

Here's the thing that I guess I realized: I probably had so much anger because I just hate to see my fellow brothers and sisters fall through the cracks; I hate to see parents who work so damn hard only for their kids to fuck up and take it for granted and instead do drugs, hit the streets, or drop out. The small % who actually made it into college, and the even SMALLER % who made it into Berkeley, are truly special - and I think that my outrage was because I am just so worried about folks who take up majors that the job market doesn't necessarily demand.. I'm just worried! There's such a history of intergenerational struggle and sacrifice behind you getting here, and we all know that education is a means to upward social mobility, but not all educational majors are valued equally in the job market! I'm just worried man, and I really hate that I expressed my genuine concern in a way that was instead aggressive, ignorant and hateful.

I'm so sorry. I hope you all can understand. I truly did learn a lot though from all your comments.. thank you. I will carry this perspective going into the professional and social world forever, and will look at minority folks who make it through the system in a very high regard. Thank you."

I don't understand why someone can get jealous over their friends hanging out with someone else, a true friend should be more supportive and it's not like I'm ditching him or anything. What makes this more confusing is that when he and I actually hang out he treats me like shit anyways, he's not supportive, he puts me down and to make it worse he doesn't treat any of his other friends like that, so I don't get it. Is he a true friend?"

I cry sometimes because it's hard to keep up, but you do to see me bitching about it. It upsets me when people like you, who had never been exposed to an actual struggle but what type of shoes to buy or studying for the SAT, say and try to insult us. Try living like us and you will overcome your ethnocentrism."
1002,2013-11-08 03:51:30,"here are a massively disproportionate amount of ""grinders"" at Cal; they game the system by studying all day every day, and unlike Stanford our admissions department doesn't do anything about it. i'm so fucking tired of taking math / stats / eecs classes, with mostly fucking talentless people who study 4x as much as I do, and can't beat me on the midterms. and don't even get me started about their complete inability to hold a conversation, or loose their virginity by the time they graduate.

this is the difference between Stanford and Cal. why do you think they don't release their mean HS GPA data? because it's probably lower than you would think, and probably lower than ours.

also, fuck Chicano / Chicano people who somehow got into Cal. i'm tired of paying full tuition here so you can major in Chicano Studies. Go to SF State for that shit; it won't make a fucking difference anyways."

You all bitch about how disadvantaged you are; advocating that more of your own kind make it into colleges when the vast majority of you take up BULLSHIT majors like Chicano studies, ethnic studies, American studies, history, n shit like that. What the fuck is the point of going to college when all you get is a useless major, tuition debt and lost wage that you could've made had you just went straight to work. Then, you guys talk shit about Asians as the model minorities in your stupid ass ethnic classes without realizing that we became the ideal minority as a result of learning how to QUIT BITCHING about your fucking disadvantages and inequality and START working the system. Most of y'all are pseudo-Marxists, talkin about how the white capitalistic system is oppressing your people (using other buzzwords like: modern colonialism, cultural imperialism, economic inequity, social injustice and bullshit like that) when really the problem is that most of your kind are ungrateful fuckheads who, instead of honoring their parents' hard work and sacrifice, become punk ass thugs who get caught up for crime or impregnating some chick in high school and thus dropping out. Learn how to fuckin stop bitching and start hustling. Drop your fake ass majors and take up something that will actually create an ROI for your parents and our state government."

Not only what the words can ruin the friendship, any important relationships, but most importantly, it damages his/her REPUTATION. It also creates conflicts and misunderstanding between people. Words can really hurt one person so badly when it is not true, partially true.
SO PEOPLE, PLEASE DO NOT LISTEN TO WHAT OTHERS TELL YOU ABOUT SOMEONE UNTIL YOU ACTUALLY KNOWS/SEE THAT PERSON. Because anyone can creates rumors about someone due to various reasons, e.g. jealousy, hatred... 
And to those people who like to talk shit about people/ judge a person, please stop it! Those people who likes to gossip about others are not trustable! Because imagine he/she can tells you shit about someone else, one day, he/she can turn their back and also talk shit about you! Just be aware and don't make assumptions. Don't judge someone without processing and consolidating the facts. One of the most important values to a person is their reputation. It is just unfair to judge a person without actually knowing/seeing it personally!? Isn't it?"

1021,2013-11-07 19:48:12,"his is not a confession, but a humble request to all those out there in UC Berkeley Confessions Land...

My little sister and I started a t-shirt line that is very near and dear to our hearts because it is named after our mom who passed away a year and a half ago from ovarian cancer. We created this t-shirt line so that we can keep her legacy alive, but also to help us contribUte to my mom's non-profit organization AISCS (aiscs.org) . Which works to empower women, bring water and education to children in rural Tanzania.

Our clothing line is called ""akelo."" and you can check us out on facebook at: www.facebook.com/akelolifestyleco to learn more about us.

The reason I am posting is because we have t-shirts, but we want people like you to model them for us. We want to have a photo session in Berkeley on Saturday Nov. 9th, so if any of you are interested in volunteering your time, that would be amazing! Of course we can only have people 18 and over unless they have their parents with them and we will ask everyone to sign a photo waiver. We can't really afford to pay anyone, but we will be happy to email you a copy of the picture we take of you and if you want to buy a t-shirt, that would be AMAZING! We are not professional photographers at all, so no pressure.

Please message us on our facebook page if you're interested. :)

Thanks!

Pamela and Sarah."

Since then, i began going to the library every tuesday at the same time, but I didn't see her around anymore. I felt my heart sink a little. Recently, I saw her walking with a group of friends towards LeConte, and as bad as this sounds, i followed them just because I didn't have any more classes and I wanted to see if I could talk to her. I noticed she had a COE pin on her black backpack and I almost went crazy. She walked into a E92 seminar, and I couldn't help but to just smile like a dumbass. She's an engineer! Now i really want to get to know her… at the very least know her name. I hope she's not dating anyone, because she's a rare thing to find on this campus!

1066,2013-11-07 03:15:34,"efore coming to Berkeley I knew it was going to be a challenge, but I was determined that I would figure it all out once I got here.Coming to Berkeley has been one of the hardest things I've ever done. I am literally working the hardest I have ever worked and time after time I am disappointed that even with all the work I put in, that I am barely passing and in some cases failing. I came in with an idea of what I wanted to pursue, and now I unsure of what to do. It is a routine of stressing myself out and pushing myself, and all for what seems like nothing. 

I used to be very social, now I am spending most of my time in class, in the library, or in my room studying, reading, or writing a paper. I still make a conscious effort to stop, take a break, eat, shower, and sleep, but I'm always thinking of when is all this going to just explode and I lose it. 

It's hard seeing everyone else manage all of this, while I am here on the edge of what feels like the lowest point I've ever been in my life. Some days I think of transferring out to a community college, but I have too much pride to throw away everything. Sometimes I dream I had the courage to just call it quits, sell everything in my possession, gather all my money from bank accounts, pick up my passport and just fall off the grid. I'd much rather spend this one life I had exploring all the beauty of the world. Go base jumping, go cliff diving on some remote island, climb a mountain, experience all there is in life...

Anyways, if you took the time to hear me vent all my issues thank you. Just putting this all down helped me clear my head."

I really want to get involved in one of the dramatic student groups here, but it doesn't feel like I have it in me to put myself out there like that anymore. Fucking social inhibition, man."

When you forget to bring your wallet, I won't mind paying for you. When we talk about classes, I won't bring up course subjects. I'm going to keep being regular me but an understanding me. When people bring the topic up, I'm going to defend you even when you think it's not about you I'm talking about.

Not only are we the world's preeminent public institution, we also have a beautiful campus, a multitude of events, and a diverse student body. So again, stfu if you can't stand it here and are doing nothing to get out. I will continue to defend our university, because Berkeley is my home. Go Bears."

1087,2013-11-07 01:53:20,"dont really understand why a guy would show all the signs that he likes you, takes you out etc etc. Then suddenly disappear. It is the fear of commitment or just did he realize that he wasn't that interested after all? Either way, why can't you just be honest with me instead of disappear off the face of the earth and leaving me wondering. I don't understand how a person cannot feel guilty about doing something like this. Seriously if you know they had feelings for you and you were displaying those feelings too- don't you at least owe it to them to tell them what's going on? & If you don't feel guilty thats fucked up."

1099,2013-11-06 22:00:44,"feel so alone. Everyday I walk through campus, telling myself that it'll be okay. Every night I get ready for bed early so I don't feel like this anymore.
It's weird. I thought college was going to be the best time of my life...I mean everyone said it would...and I was excited! But turns out, it's been a disappointment so far. I've tried. I've really tried to enjoy my time here, but I can't. I guess it's due to the lack of friends I have here. I mean don't get me wrong, I do have ""friends"", or are they really? They hit me up when they're bored or have no one else to call. They text me when all their other friends are busy. If I were to just disappear would they care? No. I sincerely and honestly do not think so.
I'm not sure if it's me or not. I mean, I think I'm a fairly average person. So why am I incapable of making true and real friends? It sucks...I mean it really sucks. I don't think anyone deserves to be lonely in this world, but here I am...lonely as ever. I know it may seen like I'm complaining, but I'm a 2nd year student right now and honestly, I'm getting tired of this. Tired of being sad a night. Tired of being close to tears daily. Tired of looking through my phone and noticing that there isn't anyone I can call if I were in trouble or needed someone to talk to. The only people that I feel a close connection to are my friends from high school, but they're far far away at their college. They've made great friends, and though I a happy that they're having a blast, I'm jealous. And bitter at times.
What I want is just to be happy. I do not know what I'm doing wrong. I've joined clubs, but I feel like I don't fit in anywhere. Some of you may say ""You're not trying hard enough!""...But I am. It's not like I'm an antisocial person who doesn't talk to anyone...though I feel like this loneliness is slowly eating me up. Maybe this in turn has made me slightly anti-social? I don't know. When I hit people up, we hang out...and that's it. I invite and invite and invite....yet I get none back. Does this mean they don't like me? I feel like they'll jump at the opportunity to call me when they need something...like homework help.
I hate my time here now. I know I may sound like an angry negative bitch now because of this long and sad confession, but in reality I'm not. I'm a fairly cheerful person and love doing fun and adventurous things! But I can't help but feel negative when I'm unhappy. Which is a lot. Sometimes, when I'm by myself after class, I feel so alone that it hurts. Like a deep painful punch in the stomach, and I feel so completely alone. Like no one understands. I've heard people say ""yeah well this is college, get used to it""....but I've seen people around campus laughing and joking and genuinely enjoying their time with one another. Maybe a best friend, a close friend?
I just cannot imagine feeling this way for the next 2 years and a half. But what can I do? I just need an answer..."

And because of that, I've always (and especially recently) had people say things like ""teach me how to be like you"" or ""I wish I were you"" or something along those lines.
Well, for those of you who feel like that and aspire to be someone else: stop it. I am special, and if there were two of me, I wouldn't be so. Just because I don't feel the hardships of school doesn't mean life doesn't throw other challenges at me. And when it comes to things like that I wish I were like you guys too. But regardless, I'm perfectly happy being the guy that I am, and so should you. And if I even as much smell a scent of my copy out there somewhere, I will hunt you down, and make you realize how awesome you really are. We are all born unique; we all better die that way.

1173,2013-11-05 18:50:15,"his is the same person that posted the human trash comment yesterday.

I stand by what I said. If you all are ignorant enough that you think the world we live in is all fuzzy and warm, then you obviously haven't seen shit. You've probably never gotten jumped walking back from a late class, or had your phone stolen by a guy on a bike or two ladies in a car. You probably haven't been raped, or had an insane woman attack your floormate near people's park when walking back from CREAM. Or had a drunk homeless person follow them home. Each one of these things I have either seen personally or heard from people I know.

You guys are right, most homeless people and mentally unstable people are good people in bad situations, but by just letting them live here on the streets and in people's park it is not a good, safe place for them, and it's not good for the people and students living in this city. Let them live somewhere else. It invites other unsavory characters to come in. Crimes are way up this year, ghetto ""people of all colors"" (blacks) from Oakland/Downtown Berkeley rob people at gunpoint ON MAIN CAMPUS. Read the newspaper. Just cuz it hasn't happened to you, doesn't mean it won't.

And thanks for telling me to jump off a bridge. That's exactly the type of inclusivity that makes living in Berkeley difficult. As soon as you have an opinion that goes against the Berkeley Golden Bear Ideals, you get shit on. What kind of free speech and acceptance is that?

Sorry your mom's mentally unstable, but at least she's working. Can you say that much for those on the streets? Drug addicts and beggars are not adding anything to our city. We need to get these people help, or something, but they shouldn't stay here."
1174,2013-11-05 18:21:16,"hen I'm nervous, especially studying for midterms, I clip my toenails, put them on a little plate, and chew them. It's like biting my nails, but better because my fingers are flawless. recommended if you need a study snack, basically no calories, because it'll just be recycled into you, and it's basically harmless but I'd advise locking the door before you do it im always scared my roommate will think im a little weird"
1175,2013-11-05 18:04:17,"o the cute little asian chick living in Martinez, 4th floor, talk to me already! I've been walking by the lounge, by your room, by you in hope that you start a conversation. I admit that I am too shy but i'm just too intimidated by you."

GOD DAMN!!!!!!!!! she was fine specimen, like you niggas wuldnt believe your EYES. she had the circumference of 322 1/3 inches and had big ass pepporoni nipples (and boooooooooooooooyyyyyyyyy were they edible). She caught me starin' at her voluptuous 10/10 body and she walked over to me. My 3 inch cock was about to rip my 7000$ Hugo Boss exclusive pants when she pulled down her stretchy brown stained thong and sat on my face. Her bushy vagina tasted like a double Big Mac with a side of fries and a large coke. I came within 2.65349 seconds (6 sig figs), spat on her for being fat and useless. . Then, I  put my elongated cranium(cuz im smart as fuck) inside her tight, wide ass vag cuz I wanted to crawl back into her womb to be the son she never had. YOLO."
1177,2013-11-05 18:45:20,o the asian girl in Teleman's math 54 lecture with the long bangs and a blue sleeveless top - you are like the cutest person I've ever seen. Just putting it out there.
1178,2013-11-05 18:36:21,"an we form a fellatio-cunnilingus cooperative? Sometimes I just get super horny and unproductive, and it takes too much time and planning to pick someone up from a frat party or build sexual trust with a person I know. 

If we had an operation of cooperative third-base exchange at Berkeley, I believe we could solve many problems that students here face. We could even de-stress a student enough for him to get the A needed for him to get into Harvard for grad school and thus give him the resources to cure cancer!

So what are we waiting for? Let's start the fellatio-cunnilingus cooperative society!"
1179,2013-11-05 18:27:23,"really want to do something about everything going on with Tele-Bears. It feels like none of us are getting the classes we need, and all the big lectures are already getting full way too early. It doesn't seem fair that one's enrollment can be so drastically affected by the randomness of the system.

I don't know what I would do though. I really just want things to change."

1182,2013-11-05 16:06:30,hy does everyone in this page appear so vulgar? I thought Cal students would be more classy...having sex with every slut/manwhore in a frat party will not make this school or yourself better...just saying.

1190,2013-11-05 16:22:45,"can't stand my roommate.  He is such an asshole... He literally is always pulling girls and bringing them home.  Sometimes a guy wants to sleep on a Wednesday night instead of listening to some random girl who can't handle her shit during apparently earth shattering orgasms.  And seriously?! I wake up to him and some girl banging ON MY BED. WHILE I'M SLEEPING THERE...  Yes he looks like an exact twin of Max Schneider, but seriously it's just an 11 inch penis. Not even that impressive.

If that wasn't bad enough, I can't even sleep in because he just has to make them breakfast, every time.  
So what you worked in a soup kitchen lost kittens?  I don't get why girls melt over that so much.  And it's like yea, dude, I know you have the abs of Taylor Lautner but do you really have to use them to crush cans?  I used to think you were cool, but it turns out you're just a woman-slaying gentleman-beast and it's getting between us man.  Some of us have to use porn, you know..

1192,2013-11-05 16:00:47,"hy is it that casual sex is such a bad thing? It is just a natural human activity. Why is it so important to have to be in a relationship with a person to engaged in sex? Sometimes people don't want to have strings attached when having sex.

That being said I had one casual sex encounter and one of my floor mates saw me leave with her to her apartment. This one floor mate must have blabbed about it because everyone knows and everyone looks at me as if I am some degrading person. This is just dumb because another of my floor mates started dating a guy when she was still in a relationship with another guy, but ""oh it's okay because she wasn't happy"". Whatever I'm not going to try to get this people to like me because they must already have a bad conception of me."
1193,2013-11-05 15:52:48,"efore coming to Berkeley I had never really encounter Asians. Thus I was open minded to coming to this high concentration of Asians because I had never been around any. So far I have observed that most Asians are full of themselves, self centered, homogenous, think they are better than everyone else, and in some cases they are very immature. I'm just wondering are there any down to Earth Asians who are fun to be around?"

1195,2013-11-05 15:39:50,"unday night, after a long night in SLC, I come home. Inside the dorm I see my roommate passed out, balls deep inside a girl. Both of them are shit-faced drunk, and I guess right before midterms was the best time to get DOWN. So turns out, when he was banging her, he hits his head, knocking himself out (bunk beds). He falls and head-butts the girl, and this aftershock also renders her unconscious. So there we go, two people knocked the fuck out in my dorm, frozen.. in time.. in missionary."
1196,2013-11-05 15:18:53,"o the hot asian girl that I ran into almost everyday in Etcheverry. Every time I saw you, I will remember that you had hooked up with my friend next door and you were so loud that I could not concentrate studying. You should drop by my room next time. ;-)"
1197,2013-11-05 15:59:56,"onestly I think the most ANNOYING thing is how upperclassmen post dumb shit every single day to the Freshman '17 page, like do they have nothing else better to do??? Or trying to get some Facebook friends?? Y'all know what I'm talking about, annoying AF"

1219,2013-11-05 00:28:44,"onfessions of a Freshman:I have been in college for four months and it’s everything and nothing like I expected. First thing is first, I thought they would be a larger variety of cute boys and while there are some, not as many as you would expect. Friends and acquaintances are blurred into what I like to call fraintances. A combination of people who you sometimes see, sometimes say hi to or sometimes ignore, yes I know it’s confusing. Some days I feel like the only person I see consistently is my roommate. I don’t know if I have found a group of friends yet and it’s weird saying that because my phone is packed with numbers. But numbers can be deceiving, it was easier in high school to see where you belonged because you always saw your friends, college is different. I can have a two hour deep conversation with someone and then see them two weeks later, only to offer a small waive before we go our separate ways. That’s the first thing I learned, you have to build the relationships you want to have and take the time to call a friend, go out to lunch or just do something. Otherwise their name and number just become simply that, a name and number, of that person you saw that one time and their face, a blur. I guess what I am trying to say is that I am still figuring it out, I just hope I am not the only one that feels this way..."
1220,2013-11-04 22:41:45,"ear roommate,

I huge turn on seeing you really cared about your body, with your entire workout session you did alone. Really wish I could have gone up to you and said Hi, but all I could do was admire from a distance.
Hope I can see you at the gym again sometime, who knows maybe ill work up the guts to go up and talk to you."

Stop asking me what time i slept, what time i woke up, where i am going, when i am coming back. I have my own life and you have your own. I dont ask you anything cause I simply dont care and you shouldn't  either. Also, open the windows and curtain sometimes. Your not a fucking vampire. The room gets stuffy and hot, and i hate that. That is all."

1234,2013-11-04 22:54:16,"I posted this to my Facebook wall, so those who know me will recognize this.  I'm not concerned about anonymity, I just want to share this with everyone. -

Still in shock at where I am today. For my good friends and family who know where I came from; who know how long I suffered, fought, cried, and begged; who knew that I spent so much time mentally and emotionally valuing myself less than the dirt I stood on. Now we look back and don't recognize that person anymore.

And yet, there are days like today where the residual pain of the past attempts to stab me in the back. And thus I'm grateful for my friends who remind me of the essential virtue of gratitude. With it, it matters not what happened years ago, but rather the path paved to the future illuminated by the scorching Armageddon of my past, serving to brighten and guide my future decisions.

The truth is, my gratitude is for the people around me. Every last bit of knowledge, love, laughter, and tears of joy have been because of you and shared with you. To my family and friends, old and new, you are the reason why I'm here today. If it was up to me a few years back, I would have been erased from this planet. When I didn't care, you did. I owe my life to you. I will be successful and make a difference in this world because it's how I'll pay it forward after those who payed it forward to me.

Without everyone, I am a shell of a man. This life has not been, and never will be, about me. It's about being with other people. It always has been, it's just always so easy to get caught up in ""what's good for me.""

Thank you for giving me the gift of laughter, love, knowledge, and friendship. Whether or not you realize it, your impact on my life has been significant.

Happy Monday <3"
1235,2013-11-04 22:28:17,"o the girl/guy... SHUT THE FUCK UP ALREADY. THIS ISN'T THE UC BERKELEY ADDRESS YOUR BETA ASS LETTERS TO PEOPLE WHO YOU HAVE NO CHANCE WITH SINCE YOU ACT LIKE A DAMN PLEBEIAN PAGE.

A majority of you Berkeley students are still stuck in high school and it's embarrassing! Grow the fuck up!"
1236,2013-11-04 22:18:19,"o the girl at PIKE on friday dressed as one of the mean girls in the pink jacket and black skirt, you have THE greatest tits ive ever seen. i would've taken you home but you were kissing some frat boy firefighter. maybe next time"
1237,2013-11-04 22:02:20,"ately I have been running out of meal points. It's been up to the point where I am forced to eat my own shit. Honestly, I enjoy the taste of shit now. It's a taste someone has to acquire. Secretly I have been eating the shit of one of my floor mates who forgets to flush. I think I can consider myself to be addicted to shit. Do I have a problem?"
1238,2013-11-04 22:46:21,"o the guy who was wearing the Born Ruffians -""birthmarks"" album- t shirt and white headphones that i stopped to compliment, i was actually listening to Oceans Deep when i saw you.. I wish i hadnt been running late for my 1 o clock lecture to at least have asked for your name.. Crossing my fingers you see this confession or i see you again :)"
1239,2013-11-04 22:32:23,"confess that I have a crush on one of my floormates. No, it's not some sexual fantasy where I want him to bang me against the wall. He is truly one of the most genuine guys I've met in my two shorts months here at CAL. He's funny, witty, awkward (who isn't), intellectual, sweet, considerate, and just overall a wonderful guy. I found out he's never had a girlfriend before (howisthatevenpossible) and I really am interested in getting to know him better. Any suggestions? He's an introvert and I'm afraid to come on too strong in fear he's scared off. I have a couple lectures with him too."
1240,2013-11-04 22:09:25,othing breaks your heart more than hearing your crush tell you who she hooked up with last night. I can't even be mad at her because I respect her and like her so much. Sigh.
1241,2013-11-04 22:55:26,aiting at UC Berkeley's Student Central is like waiting at the DMV.
1242,2013-11-04 22:45:30,"n that fateful night of All Hallow's Eve I witnessed your graceful presence emanating such impeccable, breathtaking, heaven-sent beauty from across the room. Your piercing, carnal gaze turned me to mush and left me powerless. In an unworldly fervor, we made passionate love all over our university campus; from tumbling down the steep steps to caressing each other on top of the copy machines . I knew you were a Subway employee, because you absolutely gave me a footlong. And in a moment of pure serendipity we simultaneously climaxed at Peking Express, whilst you fed me Orange Chicken on the bare HUB floor. You then disappeared into the night, never to be seen again. So my dear love, if this was meant to be, meet at top of the Campanile tonight as the clock strikes 12."
1243,2013-11-04 22:33:31,spend waaayyy too much time reading UC Berkeley Confessions and not studying.

1250,2013-11-04 16:24:45,"o the curly haired girl in my buddhism class with the nose ring, what are you and your friends always laughing about? I want to make you laugh like that."
1251,2013-11-04 16:04:46,"uy at Main Stacks who asked me to watch his stuff? You're very, very hot. I like your beard and style. I want to sit on your face.

That is all."
1252,2013-11-04 16:47:47,"ow this gon' be the hardest thing I think I ever had to do
Got me talkin' to myself askin' how I'm gon' tell you
'bout that chick on part 1 I told ya'll I was creepin' with, creepin' with
Said she's 3 months pregnant and she's keepin' it
The first thing that came to mind was you
Second thing was how do I know if it's mine and is it true
Third thing was me wishin' that I never did what I did
How I ain't ready for no kid and bye bye to our relationship"
1253,2013-11-04 16:40:48,"very time we make eye contact you smile at me and of course I smile back. But what the fuck does it all mean? Are you just being friendly or are you attracted to me? I'm attracted to you. I gave you an opening last week, an excuse for us to have some time away from the classroom, but you didn't take it. Now I'm wondering if I'm reading too much into everything. 

You should understand that I can't be the one to initiate. I have... ""prior commitments,"" as they say. But if you give me a clear sign, if you smile a little wider or sit a little closer, and I know that I'm not just imagining things, I'll go for it. You have my number and you have my email. I've been to your place and I still remember the way. So say the word, for both our sake."
1254,2013-11-04 16:29:49,"o the guy I met at Cloyne on Friday, you're one of the nicest guys I've ever met and I certainly had a great night :)"
1255,2013-11-04 16:06:50,"really really really like this guy. He seems like such a great catch but there is one issue..he keeps giving me mixed signals. He will constantly be in touch with me, flirt with me for 24 hours straight on text and then he will vanish in thin air. No texts, nothing for another week until I text him. He behaves very casually when we start talking again, as if we never stopped in the first place. He says he's been really busy.

I don't know if he likes me or not. I don't know what's going on. I don't know what to do."
1256,2013-11-04 16:56:53,"eople who wear colored contacts on a daily basis creep me the fuck out. It's not attractive and everyone can tell you're wearing them, stop it."
1257,2013-11-04 16:34:56,o that Indian girl I always see at ihouse: you are so beautiful. I was so happy the other day when I had the chance to have a brief conversation with you. It made my day! Plus that ass of yours...I wouldn't mind having a piece of that. ;)
1258,2013-11-04 16:01:57,"oing back to my apartment after soccer practice, I needed to fart so I let out a big one but shit came out. I am now forever traumatized to fart again in public :("
1259,2013-11-04 16:48:10,"hat do you do when you feel completely alone and isolated, when you feel as though you do not belong and should not be here? I know you really shouldnt depend on anyone but yourself in life, but it feels good to have someone to talk to, to be there for you as a friend and a mentor. I miss having that, whether it was in a relationship or with my  best friends whom have distanced themselves from me, I miss having someone to talk to about the randomest things , and yet feel like it was worth every word. I can honestly say I miss having a gf, due to the fact that I had someone who I can joke around all day with, but still have the deepest heart to heart conversations with, someone to care for me and to show interest in me, as opposed to walking around campus and feeling as though I'm the odd one out.. But what can be done when youre the shyest guy who cant even say hi? nothing. It sucks and I truly miss those feelings, but life moves on and this is part of it."
1260,2013-11-04 16:34:11,"o the short girl with the braided hair who was wearing black clothing and a white scarf at main stacks today, you're really cute."
1261,2013-11-04 16:07:12,"o the asian guy dancing on the stage at TDX friday night, you are soooooooooooooooo hot and i want to be your 100th"
1262,2013-11-04 16:01:14,"here's a really pretty girl that looks just like mulan I always see walking past the campanile on Fridays. Not typical Asian girl, but MULAN. THE FUCKING DISNEY PRINCESS. can someone please give me her number?! no fetish I swear"
1263,2013-11-04 16:18:15,"ou know I get really annoyed when guys get defensive about their dick size or say they feel so degraded because their worth is determined by the size of their meat. I have no fucking sympathy for you at all. You know why? I've felt inadequate in a million ways whenever overhearing that myself or some girl is "" not pretty/hot/sexy"" enough or when guys start comparing their girlfriends or fuck buddies with each other. Then let's not forget the million times girls get hit on in the streets by leering men, or guys going up to a girl telling then damn your ass is nice! Or some shit like that.

I feel with all the shit girls go through with their looks, I'm entitled to make you feel like shit for your small dick. That's just the tip (no pun intended) of the iceberg for the pain girls have to go through on a daily basis."
1264,2013-11-04 16:12:16,"econd floor of Beverly Cleary, I can hear you having sex. Stop. Don't let other people know you can last only two minutes."
1265,2013-11-04 16:49:17,really like that cute Asian guy with the cartilage piercing and ray bans in my Chem 1A lecture.  I always see him turn around to see if his friends have arrived.  I just hope one day he looks at me! He kinda seems like an asshole though.  But he's so cute!
1266,2013-11-04 16:00:19,"o the Asian canadian boy downstairs in Erhman, while you were gone this weekend I put my shoes all over your bed, your pillow, and your towel. It was cathartic."
1267,2013-11-04 16:51:20,"s it just me or does anyone else have an inferiority thing going on while attending Cal? I am a freshman and I understand I should probably give myself a mini break since I'm supposed to be in the process of adjusting and stuff, but I see so many freaking amazing people here that it's really getting to me. I bonded with my floor mates over this topic but even they don't get it because they were all valedictorians and my grade point average sucks...I'm surprised I even got in this school at all. Everyone I've met is either a fantastic dancer, debater, singer, can speak multiple languages etc. And here I am. I don't belong in this sea of amazing fish. I'm just this tiny plankton that floats in the bottom. And people are constantly telling me to find something I love. Well. I love reading and writing but that's nothing ""cool."" People will not ""ooh"" and ""ah"" over it. It's just hard waking up every morning knowing that there are amazing intellectuals walking this campus while I'm struggling in Chemistry 1A and Math 10A. It's really not fair."
1268,2013-11-04 16:13:21,"o the person who said they have ""no real friends"" - I went to confessions to confess the same thing and came across your post.  Just wanted to say it's nice that I'm not alone, but I hope we're both able to sort things out.. I feel pretty alone and shitty and sometimes I want to cry while walking on campus"

1270,2013-11-04 16:49:25,"y EX-boyfriend hit me for the first time this past weekend. I kicked him in the crouch and pepper sprayed him. He cried and I spit on him while I called him a piece of shit. I walked away feeling so glad I kept to my ""I'll never let a guy get away with hitting me"" I made in middle school after watching my brother hit his wife the first time. 

I told him if he tried to contacting me again, I will call the police."
1271,2013-11-04 16:34:26,"y roommates and I just witnessed this sketchy ass dude on the second to last floor in the hallway of wada. He was looking out the window... or trying to break the window.

1273,2013-11-04 16:17:31,"fucking hate the homeless, mentally unstable, or the ghetto black people in berkeley. They make me uncomfortable, and I wish the city would do something about it. I get it, Berkeley is great for being inclusive and loving and we did some cool stuff in the 60s. but it's 50 years later and the city is getting ghetto. I don't feel safe walking around town and campus because of it. we should pick up the human trash on the sidewalks."

We have a hairy situation going on...
You're awesome

So when you shower
Please refrain from flinging it
All over the walls
All over the sink
and All over the tub
Clean up yo hairy ass shit!

1277,2013-11-03 22:55:37,"o the girl who's sad because the guy you have a crush on was kissing another girl on Halloween: I think that guy was me. I'm really sorry, it felt like you were kinda blowing me off and not talking to me, so I went to talk to some other people, one of whom was the ""other bitch"" who started coming on to me. I wish I'd had the courage to tell her to stop, but I didn't, and I really regret it. I like you too, so please give me another chance. I promise I'm a better guy than what I showed that night."
1278,2013-11-03 22:48:43,"o the girls that walk barefeet in Ida Sproul, I want to lick y'all butt cracks sideways."
1279,2013-11-03 22:40:44,"hen I first met you, I had no idea of the incredible person I was actually meeting.  The first time I saw you, my breath was taken away at how incredibly beautiful you are.  I quickly discovered how positive and kind you were.  Each time we've hung out I enjoy spending time with you more and more.

And the more we talk, the more I discover how amazing, beautiful, smart, funny, talented, and self-driven you are.  You've completely subverted what I ever thought possible for the amount of amazing qualities that can be had by one person.  And just when I thought there couldn't possibly be any more surprises, you surprise me again.  Your laugh is contagious, your smile is perfect, and your eyes are the most beautiful I've ever seen.  

I wish I could tell you how I feel in person, but the fact is, I don't want it to be too much too soon.  I don't know if we'll ever be anything, and any guy would be the luckiest man in the world to have you.  I just hope that I get that chance some day.  Thus, I confess this to this page because it's all that I'm thinking about.  I'm supposed to be studying but I can't get you out of my head.

You'll probably read this and not think twice about it.  But if I get the chance to tell you how I feel in person, I hope that you remember this post and that I can verbally express this to you far more eloquently than what I've written here.

Until then,
Your Secret Admirer"
1280,2013-11-03 22:21:45,spend waaayyy too much time watching football and not studying.
1281,2013-11-03 22:16:46,"ts so hard being a bi guy,  I can't just hook up with girls its cruel, but its so hard to find a nice guy to hook up with, the struggle is real"
1282,2013-11-03 22:05:47,o the guy I danced with at theta chi for like an hour on Thursday: you were the nicest guy I've met at a party (and also the most fun to dance with) and I thank you for not being a complete creep. Wish I remembered your name!
1283,2013-11-03 22:43:48,"ometimes, when my roommate Halleeza is sleeping, I like to gently clip off a bit of her toenail and tape it to the corner of my eyeglasses so she can be with me all day. Because we don't spend enough time together. I also collect the air around her bed and am working on a wig made out of her sheddings."
1284,2013-11-03 22:08:49,"don't think I have real friends here....I am constantly lonely and sad. I hate how lonely my college experience has been. No one really cares about me here. I'm just the ""convenience"" friend. Why do I feel like this?"
1285,2013-11-03 22:59:50,o the Pi Phi who's in Haas who was looking for a table at the SLC and I offered you a seat. What a beautiful girl. I wish we wouldve talked more. We should have more SLC study sessions
1286,2013-11-03 22:49:53,"m still a virgin right and this guy was like my fuck buddy but I flaked out at the last minute.  
I want to have sex, believe me, when he's lying naked on my bed with his dick just basically calling my name, I'm just like ""Fuck me"". BUT this guy, when we're in the process of touching each other and doing all that foreplay stuff, he gets kinda sweaty and thats not a problem because its fucking hot, but then he starts smelling like B.O. and that turns me off. SO I ended it, because I just lost my urge to do anything with him when he smelled.  Another thing is that I dont really care how I lose my virginity, because I just want to get it done and over with so that I can get to the fun stuff.  BUT this guy, uggghhh. When he gets to my room, I like to talk about random shit to see if he'll talk.  Honestly when a guy can keep up a conversation and not make me fall asleep it turns me on a bit, so I dont talk just to talk like a chick, I talk to see if he can turn me on. I always sit on my drawer just talking with a skirt while he sits down on a chair in front of me. SO I let him see my panties, and I secretly wish to be rambling on and on and then for him to just get up pull me to him and touch me and just kiss me.  BUT he says NOTHING. SO then I end up making the first move. Okay I believe in equality and everything, but I want him to take the initiative to do something first. I want him to say ""Take off your clothes and fuck me"" but he just sits there looking at the floor.  Seriously,stop being a pussy and man up.
Because this guy didnt make a move first I decided that I want to have sex with someone that's special to me because we will be comfortable with each other's bodies and wont mind telling each other what turns us on and what doesn't.
BUT last night I was so fucking lonely and I was contemplating on texting the guy to come over but then I realized that even though he knows that I want sex he'll want me to make the first move. UGH!
So should I just do the deed with this guy or wait for the guy who will actually step up?"
1287,2013-11-03 22:36:56,"o the guy I hooked up with on Friday:

1296,2013-11-03 18:06:19,"rian Barch, why are you spreading agression and hate? Most of the people who confess on this page are just looking for an outlet to express some pent-up emotion; you're treating them as though they have personally offended you by not acting in a 100% cold-hearted logical way. Please, help increase the self-esteem and collaborative spirit of our community rather than pushing on people's self-hatred. Your malicious facebook comments may be well-meaning, as though ""If I just point out their idiocy they'll be better people"" but I believe that you are destroying their self-confidence further and pushing them further into reliance on destructive emotional states."
1297,2013-11-03 18:37:20,"kay, there is nothing wrong with ""saving yourself"" for a guy and choosing to be a virgin until you meet the right one. I hate it when people hate on me for not just ""getting it over with."" Just because you're loose with your sexuality doesn't mean I have to be. Not all virgins are like Steve carrel in 40 year old Virgin, okay??! We are normal fucking people so let us be"

You didn't ignore your friend (even though he was drunken mess) and your dancing was so fun/funny. You didn't make me feel creeped out like other guys. I laughed and smiled a lot because of you. When you kissed me, it wasn't gross or sloppy, in fact you didn't even try to stick your tongue in my mouth at all; they were cute little pecks that crept up my neck to my ears.

I'm sorry I didn't bother to get your number nor give you mine. It didn't even come to mind when I left. You were the best fun at a party I've had in a long time. The next girl you're with is going to have a good time because you were a great guy."
1301,2013-11-03 18:46:26,"fter two months in Berkeley, I've gotten B's on 5 midterms, learned that there is a reason EECS has a reputation for being hard as fuck, developed a small inferiority complex after realizing how average I am compared to other people, and started smoking pot regularly. Oh, and I've eaten more Asian (Thai/Vietnamese/Chinese/some other stuff) food than I've cumulatively consumed in my entire life before Berkeley. 

But even with all that, my life has improved hundredfold compared to high school, so I suppose I couldn't ask for much more."

Also, when I go to someone's house for the first time and they have hardwood floors, or like a wood panel wall, I have to at some point lick it.  It's like I have to taste that person's house.  I don't do either of the aforementioned activities in front of other people.  I feel like the paper eating thing doesn't happen enough for me to have like, full-on pica, but it's still kinda weird."

Well with my luck, this made her want me even more, and it seemed like she wanted to nurse me back to health like an injured puppy. I told her that long-distance wouldn't work and we just had to break up. 

Two weeks later, we almost literally ran into each other on campus.  What's my lesson learned? Don't lie if you can't."
1315,2013-11-03 16:06:50,hen I look at Chris Harper I want to just rocket launch my pussy at him.
1316,2013-11-03 16:56:53,"t’s 8 AM and I’m walking down Dana in Berkeley, heading towards campus to start my lovely day at work. There is a little skip to my walk. Excited about the possibilities of working, I am smiling and waving hello to everybody I come across. The streets aren’t busy because it’s so early. Apartment complexes on both ends of the road fill the view. Apartment advertisement pop up in both corners of my eyes. Despite my good mood, I’m cold. You can see my breath through the icy cold winds. I’m shivering in my thick winter jacket and cuddling with my scarf to absorb the little warmth it holds. Cars are parked all along the street; I wish I had a car. Thoughts like, “if I had a car then I would have been at work much quicker” or “at least a car has a heater” cross my mind. 
So, I’m walking through and I’ve noticed a man in his car. At first glance, it looks like the man is rubbing his hands together for warmth, but when I dodge another look, I can see that he is masturbating! This Middle Eastern man, probably in his twenties to early thirties, was touching himself in public on the driving seat of what I hoped to be his car. Not only did he have the balls to do this in public, this man was fully into it! He was not subtly trying to rub one out; there was nothing secretive about his actions. It was a man who was fully naked; yes, the fucker took the time to get himself fully undressed. He looked so comfortable as if this public place was his room and open to doing whatever he pleases. His body was relaxed to a point where he had adjusted his chair backwards to optimize his masturbation experience. There was no porn on which he was focusing his sexual energy, but he was certainly enjoying himself. His smile stretched as far as his own hard dick. To make my eyes bleed more, this man was hairy, like an ape. The intensity and the fury at which he was pumping his “Peter” made him look like some Loch Ness monster ferociously attacking his dick in rage. He was beating his dick like it was a housewife in the 1950’s. 
Then comes the awkward moment when the public masturbater and the innocent bystander make eye contact. You may be asking, “what happened next?”. Well, I will share the universal phases everyone goes through when they catch someone masturbating. There are three phases one must go through to fully understand this experience. Phase one, apologize. As soon as I met eyes with this man, I immediately said “sorry” and ran. It was as if I was invading his private moment instead of him imposing his dick onto my face. Phase two begins as I try to grasp the situation at hand: anger. Angry at the dick I saw earlier, I began to stomp my feet while walking to class. Shouting, ""FUCK! I JUST SAW A MASSIVE, HAIRY, VEINY SHAFT IN PUBLIC! THIS RUINS MY WHOLE DAY!”, makes my already disturbed mind more enraged. But the further I walked away from the pervert, the more I composed myself. When the anger was all vented out, I hit the stage of full calmness. Then, I hit phase three: awe. I was in awe about the situation at hand. By the situation, I mean his penis. Yes, the huge dick I just saw. When he was masturbating, he was using two hands as his two hands didn’t even come close to covering the surface of his Sasquatch cock. The motions he was using to touch himself could be best described as akin to churning butter. In neither porn nor real life have I seen a penis this immense. I actually kind of felt sorry for him because there could never be a girl that could possibly fit his gargantuan meat-hammer inside of her. Now I see why he masturbates in public:  it’s to show off the stunning spectacle that is his most prized and cherished possession. I walked to work and started off the rest of my day as if things were normal. The event that happened to me became a funny work story among my coworkers and to them he will be known as the Cock Ness Monster."

I made sure to optimize the chances I would get the chocolate dick of my dreams. The guy was well over 6 feet, an athlete, a smooth talker, and most importantly, he was from Oakland (so I'm sure he's had a lot of experience in bed...)

He comes over to my place, ready to lay it on me like Ludacris and Trey Songz in the Sex Room. We're kissing, groping, I'm super wet and he's super hard, I'm still shivering thinking about that passion...

I slowly pull down his pants, so excited to see that chocolate cock. The moment of truth was building up in my head like the epic opening of the Lion King.

I'm smiling like crazy, it's finally there, wagging in front of my face. Except...

That shit was smaller than a travel-sized lotion bottle. Maybe even smaller than even the Asian guys I've been with.

All of my pent up excitement immediately left me. I couldn't even pretend to be happy. He immediately noticed, and at that point, I told him that he needed to leave. He kept asking why, but I was so frustrated that I screamed at him to get the fuck out of my place.

What THE FUCK JUST HAPPENED"

Or is the majority of Cal a bunch of conservative suburbanites and privileged kids whose parents didn't give them the talk? Guess when you don't have to worry about taking care of yourself your entire life you end up not knowing how to take care of yourself. Masturbation? Self-soothing? Exercise? Getting a job? General social interactions through joining clubs or something? Knowing that you don't need to work so damn hard to get an A if you are in letters and sciences? (excluding engineers, biochem, physics...you guys are beasts). Sure you all may be intelligent, but damn, get some self care in for christ's sake. This page draws a picture of Cal as a teeny bopper wasteland that will soon be destroyed by some inevitable ejaculatory explosion. A lot of you live in dorms or with room mates, find a damn creative way to shamelessly punish/play with yourself time to time so we don't have to constantly read about your blue genitalia. Make a code with your roomies so they know to give you your time or something. For those who know how to handle your shit, I'd give you a high five but I am kind of occupied (multitasking FTW)"

I hate doing ""study groups"" because there are those people who only wants THEIR questions answered and don't give a shit about mine. Even when they know the answers, they intentionally keep it to themselves. And there are another group of people who feel better about themselves by putting people down when you ask them a question. Even after you find out that they're wrong, they never learn. I hate that I am automatically seen as a ""competition"" and even when they say that we're ""not competing,"" really, they HATE it when you do better than them."

This refers to the subset of international students that shut down your friendly approach for not speaking their own language, have no problem copying each others' work to get ahead, tend to be spoiled shitless, etc. 

Fuck your excuses for not taking part in what you signed up for. You're defiling the opportunities surrounding you and taking the grades that are needed by people who give a shit about opportunity and progression.

Respect to the international students who take the brave step of cultural and linguistic immersion (and much more)."

1501,2013-10-30 16:05:12,"uring my freshman year in the dorms, there was this cute 5 ft Asian chick, who I occasionally hooked up with. I planned to take her over on a Thursday night when my roommate had discussion; so after a couple drinks, things started heating up and clothes were peeling off.  She mentioned earlier that week that she’s a squirter… from that point, I knew that I wanted to fuck her brains out until her squirting juices would flow down my esophagus, plus that’s hot as fuck.  So there I go, going down on her, licking her vagina like a thirsty cactus that’s been in the Saharan desert with no rainfall in the last 10 years. After 15 minutes of my strong muscular impaling tongue-action, she burst inside of my mouth like the bomb near Bancroft/Telegraph (if it exploded). It was hot as fuck, so since I’m a giver, I went back for seconds. Being a multi-talented, I was able to use stimulate her with my mouth and fingers at the same time, making her grab my hair back --- hearing her scream under her breathe. She shot another squirt down my throat, but this time....it tasted off.. and smelt pungent. The first one tasted more like a diluted taste, but this one had substance, like clam chowder. To my dismay, I turned on the light and across the bed-sheets and my face was full of BLOOD! It was almost like I chainsaw-massacred a cow in resident evil…. Apparently this crazy bitch just started her period as I was going down on her, making me shallow a gulp-full of period-mixed discharge. Gagging and feeling nauseous, I run down the hall into the showers, and as I’m throwing up, I look up to poster to see a Red Cross blood donation flyer."

There might be a fine line to those kinds of jokes given the setting and who's saying it, but constantly saying ""you're wrong, I'm right, I'm better than you"" isn't really going to do anything to improve equality either."

We spent the day together, just chilling and talking about/enjoying the finer things in life. Anyways, yesterday, I got a call from her about some creepy stranger knocking on her apartment door. Needing to look like the macho alpha man, I immediately raced to her home to kick this guy out. When I arrive, I find her door hanging ajar, and screams coming from inside her room.

1544,2013-10-29 14:15:32,"hy does everyone in Berkeley drive so badly?

I was simultaneously blotting the oils off of my Prada moisturized chin and merging my freshly delivered SL65 AMG onto Martin Luther King from the freeway, when from nowhere this dirty filth of a human being in a Honda Civic tries to race with me!

I gasped from air as my Dior covered eyes squinted with anguish. This dirty trash gave me the finger through his unwashed Honda windows. Mr. Walmart began to flash his halogen lights at me (mind you, one of the lamps was out----illegal!!!) and when I thought the shine was magnified through my D&G eyeglasses, I didn't suffer since my auto-dimming rear view mirrors kicked in. 

I was having so much fun as I couldn't get rid of the smirk on my Chanel red lips. I stomped on the AMG pedal with my Louboutin's to activate the V12 Biturbo's massive horsepower as I could see through my D&G the trash was gone in the wind.

I wasn't done with him yet. I slowed down to 40 mph as I approached campus waiting for him to glimpse my red exclusive Nappa leather shining through his worthless eyes. Oops! As I saw him approach, I quickly followed him but accidentally hit my windshield wipers as my YSL manicured hands accidentally slipped. 

Then some fat cop in a smelly uniform pulled me over. With a disapproving look on my face, I was quick to ask him what he wanted: Money?? Tickets to the next London fashion week? My Hermes bag to prance around in? He rolled his Neutrogena moisturized (but disgustingly wrinkled, un-Botoxed) eyes at me, but before he had a chance to write me a ticket, I began to tell him what hell I was enduring! I've been to court before and every time I go, my white Gucci pants always get stained by those ugly wooden benches. He went back to his car to write a ticket.

Meanwhile, I looked at my vintage Breitling Rescue Watch and noticed that 5 minutes has passed! I was going to be late for my Dior fitting that evening!!"
1545,2013-10-29 14:00:33,o the Asian girl who always takes selfies.  I think you're on Erhman 7?  I saw you in crossroads.  You and your friends were staring at me.  When I looked over you all took a sip.  I thought it was hot.  Hit me up ;)
1546,2013-10-29 14:50:34,"'ve made a grand total of one friend in my first semester at Berkeley and they're a freshman to boot (I'm a junior transfer). I've tried connecting with other transfer students but it's not like we can just be friends by virtue of being transfers. You'd think the case would be different with people in your own major but that's a mistake. Those people can make you seem like an outsider as much as anyone. 

Today I spotted one person i've been trying to befriend and I have good reason to believe they were avoiding me because they wouldn't look in my direction even though we were the only people around and they only responded until I essentially yelled at them. Then they acted all friendly like they honestly hadn't noticed my existence until that moment.

What am I doing wrong? How do I make the thought of being my friend less repugnant? Maybe this person thought I was romantically interested and trying to ask them out or something but hell no I'm not interested in you I already have a partner. How do I make a conscious effort of making friends without coming across as desperate? Do I need to give up my self-respect and get insanely drunk at a party I wasn't even invited to in order to make friends? Do i have to shell out hundreds of dollars to join Greek life? I can't imagine it gets easier to make good friends here as time goes on. There's just not enough time. Should I get a new haircut? Should I buy new clothes? Should I change my major? Should I eat a peach? please respond"

1570,2013-10-28 14:44:25,"lright, first off; let me say that this post maybe lengthy and if it's going to be a TL;DR for you, I suggest that you just move on. 

Now, me and this girl have been going out now for quite a while. We've done some pretty crazy things in bed and decided to turn it up a notch about a couple of weeks ago. She asked me if I was ever interested in doing a threesome. I know that may not be that 'crazy' for some of you, but it definitely is for me. I told her that I was very much interested in trying it and wouldn't mind at all as long as she was comfortable with it, too. 

The next thing that she requested was that she wanted it to be ""fair"" to both of us. That means that she wants to try the threesome twice; one with another girl and one with another guy. I thought that this was a fair proposition as we both get something out of it; however, I was definitely more interested in doing it with another girl for obvious reasons. 

Since we were going to be doing the threesome both ways, we did a rock-paper-scissors game to see which gender we're going to be messing around with first. Turns out that she won and we decided we are going to try with another guy first, then a few weeks later, another girl. Now, my girlfriend works at footlocker and there is this black guy that she works with who she has always found attractive. Somehow, she managed to convince him right away into joining us. Let me say that I have nothing against black people at all, but you will see later in this story how this ****ed up our relationship.

It was a Friday night and we were both pretty nervous about this whole thing, but at the same time, excited as it was a new experience for both of us. We all decided to just rent a hotel room for the night and I decided to bring some drinks and stuff to help us get to know each other. So we were all settled and spent maybe the first 30 minutes just getting to know each other and trying to break the ice. The guy seemed cool and I definitely didn't feel a negative vibe at all. After talking and talking, my girlfriend finally just said ""let's **** guys, I'm getting horny"". Me and the other guy were both in shock because she was so straight forward about it, but I thought we should play a game to try and 'ease' into it.

What a better way to 'ease' into it than playing strip poker? So I grabbed my deck of cards in my bag and decided this is how we're going to start it off. Now, I'm a pretty damn good poker player so I know I was going to be the last guy to strip. After playing a while, the other guy managed to lose on all of his hands and had to strip barenaked first. You're all going to think that I'm gay for saying this but the moment he took off his underwear, my jaw dropped. This guy was at least ****ing 13 inches big down there, seriously. And as an Asian guy who is only 6 inches big, that thing is gigantic as ****. This guy definitely fits the damn stereotype. We continued playing for about 10 minutes more until we just decided to get into it.

My girlfriend began sucking both of us off. It was weird because I noticed she seemed to be sucking him more than she was suck me; which is understandable since he's the new guy, but still, my dick was just so god damn small compared to him. To be honest, I was a bit jealous but hey, this was part of the deal and I'll get to enjoy myself two girls in about a couple of weeks. We then switched positions and my girlfriend wanted to get ****ed. She continued sucking me off while the other guy was about to **** her. As soon as he put his dick in her, my girlfriend just started screaming and moaning. She was having such an orgasm that she stopped sucking me off and just told me to watch. 

At this point, I felt REALLY jealous. The fact that he has a 13 inch dick made her ****ing scream out of her ***. This was definitely more than I was able to give to her. Still, though, I just kept thinking to myself ""don't worry, you'll get your part of the deal"" over and over. The guy continued pounding her and it my girlfriend finally said ""stop, it's my boyfriend's turn"".

So I slipped it in her and gave it to her for about 20 seconds. She then said to me ""Wow, seriously, I can't feel anything"". So I decided to go in harder but it didn't seem to do anything. The black guy then pushed me off and said to me, ""Dude, this is how you **** a *****"". He then proceeded to pound her and she was definitely enjoying it.

I really couldn't take it anymore by this point. It was clear that I wasn’t as satisfying as he was. I quickly put my clothes on and left for the night. The next day, I called her and she didn't pick up her phone. She then changed her facebook status and took off ""in a relationship"". I wanted to talk to her about it because I know it was a ***** move for me to just leave, so I went to her work place. Right when I got to footlocker, I saw her making out with the other guy as she just completely forgot about me.

Not saying that I’m the perfect guy, but it sucks that I can’t have a 13 inch dick like that. Sometimes, it sucks being Asian, but hey, I guess you gotta move on. Still, though, this ruined my relationship. Thought I would just rant..."
1571,2013-10-28 14:55:26,"'ve known you for so many years I can't even remember. The first time I saw you I was quickly attracted to you. You showed lots of care and respect to me and I was just feeling loved. Whenever I kiss your lips the smoothness of the touch makes my whole body shiver. I cannot imagine spending a night without you. You complete my life and give it purpose. I am really sorry for my past behavior though. I really couldn't manage the time to spend with you and now you are mad at me. Please remember I still love you…

Look, I don't give two shits about your emotional state, your feelings or your inability to engage in social interaction. I don't think most people care that you're too beta to approach a member of the opposite sex, or that you feel estranged from your self-imposed social isolation. 

Stop whining about problems that you've caused and only you have the solution to. Contrary to popular belief, it may not always be your ""fault,"" but the impetus is always upon you to fix it. 

Honestly, pull your fucking self together and move on with your life, or go squander your time crying on your own facebook page. I subscribed to a confessions page, not a virtual girlfriend. 

Also, fuck recycling.

1616,2013-10-27 17:13:53,"live on a floor where basically every girl is some sort of asian-American, beautiful, and skinny.
I am Mexican-American. But I just look white American. I have thunder thighs, big boobs, and a tiny bit of a belly. I have wavy hair that's kinda frizzy, scattered zits on my face, and a plain look about myself without any makeup on. When I get up and finish getting ready in the morning, I look in the mirror, and for a second, I think ""hey, I look kinda beautiful today."" Then I step outside my dorm room, I see these truly beautiful, essentially flawless girls, I look in the mirror again, and I'm suddenly hideous. I walk through campus all day thinking that people are staring at me; thinking that people are disgusted with my ugliness. When I'm walking through campus early in the morning or late at night, when it's mostly desolate, I'm fine. But when the campus is bustling, I constantly pull down my shirt, adjust my scarf, and pull my pants up, thinking that everyone's eyes are on me; that everyone is judging me. I always suck it in when I walk and I always sit a certain way in class—in a way that will make me look the least fat. So many people have said that they admire me. That they would do anything to be in my shoes. Those people think that I have it all together. But I don't. I hate myself. I'm unremarkable. I'm unbeautiful."

The sounds you make when you eat is disgusting. It is hella fucking distracting when I'm trying to study and you're chewing hella loud on your fucking food. It literally sounds like you're sucking a dick next to me when you eat. Not exactly what I want to here when I'm solving differential equations. Oh, and while I'm on here, stop fucking burping like a neanderthal. I don't want to hear your disgusting ass burps just 'cause you think they're ""impressive."" WHAT THE FUCK. WHO THE FUCK DOES THAT.

What that means, I have no clue, but it's very odd.

So the statistics say that roughly 50% of women are single? Let's hope you're a part of that 50%. Hoping this is true, I'm going to ask you out. Now it's just a matter of when. I'll gladly step out of my comfort zone for a chance at this."

1684,2013-10-24 22:44:16,"ince my early childhood, I've had an egregious case of yellow fever. Transferring to UC Berkeley was probably not the best step toward recovery. I can't help but fantasize sexually about even the homeliest FOBs on campus (so long as they're not fat--that's where I draw the line). I'll openly gawk at these girls, who often dress in the skimpiest or most stereotypically ""sexy"" clothing (i.e. skirts and sheer tights). Even if they notice my staring it doesn't seem to bother them because I always make sure to make eye contact--mind you, the most sexually forward eye contact I can muster. 

Let me be clear, I have no intention of speaking to these girls let alone getting to know them well enough to begin any type of physical relationship with them. Firstly, because I have a regular sexual partner already; and secondly, because I recognize from past experiences that, my strong physical attraction to them notwithstanding, I can't stand them as people. They seem to me more out of touch with reality than even liberal whites, more ensconced in their bubble of homogeneity. It's difficult to imagine that they feel any real emotions aside from the stress and excitement from a given moment. Any other emotions they project are nuanced expressions of these two basic ones.

I also recognize that this prejudice and aversion to Asian girls is a direct result of my past relationship with an Asian girl who also happens to be a Berkeley alum. Even though she's graduated and probably not even in the city anymore, I can't help but dread that I'll run into her and that she'll greet me with the same soulless affect she had when she told me she loved me and would not date anyone else when she came as a freshman and I was still stuck in high school. I soon found out the extent of an Asian girl's emotions."

It's literally gotten to the point where people can't even have fun anymore unless they are drunk out of their minds. Seriously, you guys are gonna pre-game the fucking garba?

Back then, I did not have any feeling for you because I think you are not beautiful and not special at all. But the time have passed, and I soon realized that you have a lovely eyes and whenever I looked at those eyes, it have made me feel peace inside me. And, you have done so many amazing things and you made me thinking why a little girl like you could have done and knew so many things.Beside all of those reasons, you are so kind; and especially, when I read your info on ambassador page, I felt like I am nothing if comparing to you. So on one night without sleeping, I decided to text you and asked you that could I have a date with you; unfortunate for me, you haven't looked for anything serious yet. That's why I've became your crush until now. On the other hand, I had so many chances to express my feeling when I was with you, but it seemed like I wasted those chances; because, I did not know how to talk you, make you laugh and I was like an idiot with ESL level in front of you. And, do you know the fact that it only happens to you, but not with the other girls; I can make jokes around, talk normally with other but I always wonder why can't I do that with you. That's why you may end up thinking that I am boring annoying, and can't do anything whenever you see me. But deep down in my heart, I always wish that you could be happy with whatever you're doing and could get achievement in your life. If you can read my statement, and give me a chance to ask you out for dinner or whatever events around the campus, this time I swear to God that I will express all of my feeling to you and tell you all of my thinking about you
Best wish with everything

1766,2013-10-18 18:54:53,"erkeley is full of fake people. This is especially true in the Asian fraternities where dudes try to act all hard and shit when they come from well to do families. But when you call them out in person they shy away like a little bitch. The difference between you and me is that I am actually from the hood. I'm not afraid to lose anything like you because my parents ain't got no money nor connections to bail my ass out. Just be who you are, stop trying to micmic hood swag culture cuz you aint got it. You look retarded. I have hella swag and I aint even got to try. Peace."

I've learned not to stand too close to one in particular because this person usually smells like they just left the gym. This person is extremely messy, inconsiderate, eats loudly and chews with their mouth open, and also picks and eats their boogers. . . even in front of company. I'm trying not to snap. I'm haven't and won't say anything to this person because I think it will hurt their feelings. I hope my suffering in silence is getting me some brownie points in Heaven or something."

1794,2013-10-15 18:48:49,know Berkeley is a public school and the amount of money you spend to go here is affordable compared to private schools...but when I look around no one is close to my financial situation. My parents are scraping by and one is unemployed. My parent contribution is zero dollars because they don't have anything to contribute. I look around and people are spending on this and that. I barely have money for books and food while these kids are bragging about their designer bags... I've never felt poor but here I do.

1808,2013-10-13 22:57:21,"'m a community college transfer from Berkeley City College. I used to look on at all the Cal kids with envy and tell myself that even they may be smarter than me I at least still had my social savvy. I used to criticize Cal students for not being as out going as me, comfortable around the oppissite sex, and generally well rounded.
Well, now I'm a Cal student. And, now that it's not uncommon to have a day comprised of 4 hours of class, 4 hours of work, and 4 hours of studying I understand that it is very difficult to be a social butterfly 24/7 on top of that.
I'm sorry I judged you. I'm sorry I was often defense with you at parties (because I thought you thought you were better than me), and I'm sorry I amoged you in front of your girlfriends every chance I got.
Now I'm in your shoes. I am very proud to be here in this diverse body of individuals, some of the smartest, and actually most well rounded in the world, who can still be friendly and outgoing-- even if only the slim majority of the time.

From the outside looking in you can't understand it, from the inside looking out you can understand it.
I hope I can do previous classes justice and continue the tradition of excellence that is Berkeley.

Go bears."

At the end of the bus ride a person comes up to me and tells me I am a true berkeley woman because I actually moved, she then pointed at the two other girls that didn't move and complained about how many berkeley students don't give up their seats and are just disrespectful. It made me feel good, but it also made me angry. To those of you who weren't taught how to be respectful, stop being selfish and pretending you don't see them enter the bus. Just move the fuck out of your seat when you see and elderly or disabled person. You're giving berkeley a bad name and that's not cool."

When you said stop, I thought you meant that in a kinky way so I went in deeper. I also didn't realise you still had shit in your butt. I thought that was something else like a power ranger or something so I kept fucking. I mean I don't feel good either, I got poop all over my dick and I think it still smells. Now that was weird.

But yeah we're doing our thing and then we were about to get fruity in the loops when I pulled down her pants. But all of a sudden, instead of a vagina, it was a stapler. At first I hesitated, but we fucked. It was different though, instead of me fucking her hole, she just stapled my dick a bunch. Whatever i lost my virginity. Boy what a day!"

P.S. Same thing happened a few days ago while that cute girl with the dog was trying to cross the street. Everyone just stared while she attempted to cross the street while the light was green.

1871,2013-09-19 14:34:26,"f anyone else has a job on campus or through FWS, you'll know how fucked up it is that you essentially have to wait a month or even 2.5 months until you get paid. What is this bullshit? Why can't we operate on the same level as the rest of the working world and get paid on a bi-weekly schedule? We are students, we need the money to pay for food, books, and hell maybe even a little fun when we get the chance to do it. I am sick of the bureaucratic red tape that makes life so much more difficult then it needs to be. I took the job because I needed the money to pay for my schooling, not because I wanted something to do with my 'spare' time."
1872,2013-09-18 16:20:30,"t is funny how your ""hero"" can become the person you dislike the most. She was not a tv star or a famous person, but she is my mother. I admire this women because she raised her family by herself, and ""she was always there for me. I have now realize that that is not true. I came out to her and her first words were "" You are traumatize. Be careful old guys might rape or molest you."" Some would say that she loves me, but I doubt it. I told her that I was molested when I was 13 by a women and that was the least of her problems. She tells me that I am not gay because I am not neat. Then I guess that I am not part of my ethnicity group because I don't take pride of it. I have watch numerous gay and straight porn and I feel nothing. There is no difference. The more porn I watch the more disgusted I become with sex. It seems humiliating, but the beauty of it is that when it is love, when you do it with the person you love, the humiliating acts are no humiliating. I have never kiss a man or girl, but I have fallen in love with a straight man. I am not clingy and I respect the boundaries, but my disgusting love has help me improve as a person. I feel that I can reach the sky and do anything. Every time my mother asks me if I am sure, she brings me down. She has a basic definition of what it means to be a man. A man is not someone who fucks every girl he sees. A man is a person who protects, is not afraid to be himself. When she told me that I was a man, I felt happy. I thought she was going to say that she was proud of me for taking this step and not ending my life or for not becoming the typical gay guy who goes into the night looking for sexual partners. She taught that a man is a person who is dirty. I spent last night in front of my laptop watching straight porn hoping to become straight and nothing! I woke up this morning and I wanted to commit suicide. I wanted to kill every person I saw because they have peace, love and confidence. Yes, maybe I am not gay, but shouldn't you be happy that this love as you call it, has increase my self-esteem. There are worse things in the world than been gay. There are straight and gay people who do incest, pedophiles, and murders. I wish I could say farewell to you, but I still love. I am sorry that I am not the little boy you wanted. I know that the best thing for me is to set my distance, but I have kids who need me in their lives. If I need to live a heterosexual to see my siblings grow, then I would do it, but don't expect me to live long. Your problems are the only inheritance that I'll keep from you. I was there when you were sick, when you had problems with my siblings, and I was there when everyone else don't their back on you. What does everything have to be about you? I need my Mother! Please solve your personal problems, so you can help your son feel good about himself once again."

1885,2013-09-12 15:08:50,"must confess that every rumor about Prof Givental is absolutely, 100%, without a doubt, true. I'm just unable to piece together what he's saying in lecture despite my best attempts. I feel like a stupid sack of shit because everyone else seems fine and Prof Givental is clearly very intelligent and teaching a subject that's child play to him, but for all I try, I just can't figure it out, no matter how much time I spend at the library/asking for help/losing sleep. His accent and handwriting are horrendous and I don't even know where to begin to ask questions; lectures are completely different from homework/discussion problems. My peers either can't help, or can help but aren't willing to waste their time on people who don't get it--they have their own things to do (or at least that's the attitude I've encountered). It's absolutely horrible and I have no idea how I'm going to get out alive. I guess it's a combination of his lack of effectiveness in conveying course material, the failure of my GSI to explain it in a way I might understand, and my own pure, unadulterated stupidity. I came into the class with low hopes and I am sure I will leave not only with those expectations confirmed--despite all my efforts to break out--but also a complete lack of confidence in myself and my abilities. Just wanted to vent. I've basically already abandoned all hope. Be prepared to have given[tal] up all hope only a few weeks in, ye who enter. Have a nice day."

1889,2013-09-10 18:23:10,"have a theory about Breaking Bad. Instead of Walter White doing the cooking, it was really Walter White jr. and his companion Brock doing the cooking, ya hear me? Since jr. fucking loves his cereal due to his cereal palsy, he took up cooking meth to fuel his need. Along the way, he met Brock, who also loves himself some good ass breakfast. Together they created the greatest Meth empire ever. They dealt their Meth within Fruit Loops and Apple Jacks cereal boxes to get kids hooked on it. They only dealt during breakfast times to ensure the meth kept it's cereal like qualities. Hell even when Jr. cooks, he would change the purity of the meth to change the colors so it would look more like cereal. It all makes sense now. Yeah. And when anybody would cross Jr., he fucking killed them by forcing them to eat so much cereal they exploded. Walter White didn't kill Gus, if you look closely, there is a cereal box in Gus's room as Walter leaves, implying it was Jr. who actually did the crime. I know this because I took a film class at Berkeley. Jr. even told some guy to fuck off by saying ""St-st-stay outa myyyyy territory....Biiitch!"" I thinking of doing a decal on this. Should I?"

You put me down a lot. I have depression, I never told you because unlike you, I didn't want people to pity me or give me special attention. Only ONE person knows of my depression- my man. and he is supporting and helping me through it. But you fueled a lot of my sadness. And it hurt that the girl I called my best friend, I couldn't even tell her that. because you and the other girls were so unaccepting. I didn't feel comfortable and you never made the effort for me to be comfortable either. you always asked why I talked about dieing so casually, but when I would try to tell you the reason, you would say okay bye I gotta go. but some how you had time to talk about all YOUR problems to me. You told everyone that I was me who wasn't trying and that hurt because no matter how much annoyed I was with you, I was there. I never told you to change, but you did tell me to change and that's where I had enough. I apologize about the way it ended; there was no communication and I burned the bridges a little to quickly. But im not sorry for regretting calling you my best friend. I should have known better; best friends don't hurt each other like that. And I now know my place in your life as well. Not once did you try to talk to me after I stopped talking to you guys. But that's fine, id rather be enemies with someone than have fake friends. I need more friends like the people met in high school, who support me, believe in me and make me laugh. not make me cry. I am a strong person, but you tore me down. But that's okay, its a life experience. I am getting back up, I have battled demons like you now Im battling my inner demons. I really do hope you get to do all that you wanted; I may despise you, but I won't ask for the worst stuff to happen to you. Im not that kind of a person. good luck, and I hope your a better friend to others than you were to me. Im not saying that as an insult; I wouldn't want you to lose your friends. 

sincerely, someone who just had to say a last goodbye and why it is a goodbye and not a see you later."

1947,2013-05-27 18:50:56,"’m not sure we should classify “prison rape” as rape anymore. I define rape as ‘forced sex + power’, and men have all the power in the world, especially white men, who are more likely to have sex forced on them in prison, which proves that karma exists.

But then I have to apply this to white women. White women have the privilege of being white, but also the disprivilege of being female. It is a clash of powerful and powerless. So how does it work out? Either white women are incapable of being raped because of their white privilege, or they are capable of being raped, and raping female people of color is DOUBLERAPE.

Addendum: But I’d rather not have white women weigh in on this, as I fear their bias will lead them all to say “no, we can’t be raped”, because no one wants to be able to experience the worst thing in the world. We need outsiders looking in, because insiders can’t check their biases and privileges"

It's only been a few months that I've been taking some actions to show how much I care about her (e.g. asking her to dinner on valentines, sitting next to her and talking to her in lectures, etc). It's been only mildly successful in the sense that we are much better friends and I feel more comfortable talking to her now but it's sometimes hard to hold a conversation with her (e.g. she stops texting/messaging me back after a while). She doesn't show any signs (that I could tell) that she's interested in me.
I've been feeling really insecure and flirting with other girls (not that she would actually know) and I feel really horrible now. :("

If they don't get a grade they like, they run to the professor and demand that it be changed. 

If a girl asks for a grade change: ""Suuuuure, why not, here Ill bump your C+ to a B, or your B to an A-, seem fair, i guess if you're complaining you must have some ground to go on""

The 'meow' and 'nya' sounds are how human linguistics interpret cat speak. These phrases don’t harm cats or maliciously misrepresent them and it is fine to use them in everyday conversation or when referring to cats.
However, the '' emoticon is problematic. It reinforces a cutesy stereotype of cats that reduces them to shallow play things, instead of the strong, independent creatures that they truly are. Cats are not for your entertainment. They are not to be looked at and cooed over. The '' face says that the worth of a cat is based on their cuteness level instead of their mind, soul, and spirit. It is disgusting how humans think they can dictate how cats should look, like they have any authority to set the standards of acceptable feline appearance. I know humans are nature’s oppressors, but are you so power hungry that you have to enslave an entire species just to uphold your unrealistic kitten fetishization?

I don't need special help just because I am a minority, I am perfectly capable of succeeding without government help or the pity of these White liberals who feel White-guilt or the 'solidarity' of these White-hating minorities.

However, something has been bugging me for some time now and I don't feel that I can comfortably share it with others in the gay community.. I believe that we should not include transgendered people in LGBT. Being transgendered is not the same as being gay or bi because it is not a sexual orientation, it is gender expression regardless of orientation. I feel that in order to better educate the public at large about the gay community, we need to disassociate anything that might confuse people of that. I know that there are still a lot of ignorant people who believe that somehow all gay men want to become women and gay women want to become men, but that is so far from the truth and I think that having the transgender community included in the LGBT community contributes to that. Don't get me wrong, I am not transphobic and I do believe in fighting for equal rights for transgendered people, I just believe that we should keep transgendered issues distinct from LGB issues. I am still going to fight for their rights, but I wish I could voice this and have a civil dialogue with others in the community about it. Aren't we civil enough to at least consider this for a moment? I am not asking to stop fighting for transgender rights as I know that there is even more to be done to correct injustices towards the transgendered community and even more confusion surrounding it; I simply feel that both the LGB community and the transgender community will make more progress by keeping our issues distinct. We can still be allies and we can still support each other; I just want to do it in a way that more clearly distinct.

Look at this university. Look at how many of us are Asian. Do you think that is any accident? Many of us came from poorer homes and faced obstacles such as language barriers. The first wave of Asian immigrants was primarily Chinese labor workers, similar to the plight of Spanish speaking immigrants today. The only difference is that we actually managed to outperform the dominant race (Whites) at almost everything that matters. We have the lowest dropout rate of high school and college, we have the lowest teen pregnancy rate, we make up the smallest percentage of the prison population, we have the highest level of education, we have the highest median income, we are the healthiest ethnic group, we have the highest percentage of married households ... do I need to go on?

Why don't we ask all people that same question? Sometimes you ask a caucasian in the states where they are from and they just say like  LA or something, should i start asking them where they are from originally? They could be from sweden, norway etc. Why is the question only directed at people of color? It shouldn't matter."

2050,2013-04-07 16:30:25,"don't go to berkeley, but I am a newly admitted freshman. I visited berkeley, thinking that everything would be so wonderful, but we had two horrible tours from two very incompetent guides. The residential hall guide refused to tell us that we were lost and when we finally found the dorm, she just barged in on someone's messy dorm to show us what they looked like. The hippies and the homeless people were unnerving as well because they kept on running up to us and yelling in our faces.  I don't know. I've heard plenty of negative things about berkeley's undergrad program, but I never took them to heart, thinking that those were isolated incidences that occurred to relatively few students.  But lately, I've felt disenchanted from the whole Cal experience. I don't know if this is the school for me.  The reason why I am posting this here is because I want to have input from some current berkeley students.  Can you give me reasons (remind me) why berkeley is amazing (besides the  obvious things like it is the best public college, etc) and why I should disregard my bad experience and SIR to Cal? I would very much appreciate any helpful feedback I get. I am very confused and stressed right now. Thank you."

2053,2013-04-06 20:17:31,"o... I'm still in love with my high school sweet heart that broke up with me over 2 and a half years ago, she ended up cheating on me with another guy from frisco... i've been dating my high school best friend for the past 8 months but i can't seem to get the guts to tell her i'm still in love with my ex and that i'm losing feelings for her... don't get me wrong i havnt spoken or come into any kind of contact with my ex in over 1 and a half years. Worst part about the situation is i'm a senior living off campus and rent out a room in a house in el cerrito... recently 1 of the rooms opened up and I was supposed to help the home owner interview the person that answered the ad of course destiny shoots me in the head and its my ex girlfriend that walks through the door the day of the interview my heart dropped and i felt like crying but believe i kept a straight face the entire time... she introduced herself as if we were complete strangers and walked out as if nothing ever happened between us... i told the home owner that i wasnt sure if it would be a good idea to let her move in and told them, as much as it killed me, that she was a party girl and may come home late at nights and cause problems if she comes back drunk, of course this was partially a lie, but they said that they will give her a chance... today i found out she is moving in at the end of the month and her room is being renovated because there was mold under the old person's mattress, god knows what they were doing or how that appeared, and so the home owner told her if it would be okay if she stayed in my room for the first month without my consent and my ex agreed saying it was okay... I feel torn between my current gf, who has been my best friend for over 10 years now, and my ex that i have known for the past 7 years and dated for about 3... I don't know if i should tell my gf that shes moving in and i dont know what i would do if my ex came on to me only one night"

She still thinks my cooking is ""deeeeeee - lick - scious"" as she says... she wonders why and i tell her its cuhz i put love into my cooking... she likes meat she just doesnt know it"

She must have been a sadist or something cause she always took pleasure in hitting me and telling me how she loved to get wet. But dear god the bane of my existence was this adult couple that I could NOT seem to avoid. You know these types of couples that are absolutely sickening, like they wear matching outfits and finish each other’s sentences? Yeah they were complete creepers, and they had a cat, which was at least twice as annoying as they were, I swear this thing would never shut the hell up.

2084,2013-03-22 14:10:32,"honestly think that only white people should have to pay tuition. Hear me out for a minute: White people are disproportionally wealthier than non-whites and our country as a whole will benefit greatly from having a more diverse educated society. Many of you don't realize how many times a brilliant minority student has to turn down an acceptance to an elite school because they can't find the means to afford it. Additionally, men should pay higher tuition than women since it is still true that men make more than women for the SAME job. The only exceptions I think should be for queer whites because they also are very oppressed by other whites. They are disproportionally bullied through their lives and much more likely to commit suicide that they should get a break for going to college. Furthermore, we should cut all breaks for veteran students. Military spending is the single largest portion of the federal deficit, and you want to spend MORE money on those who have participated in war? By doing so, we only encourage sending more people to fight our imperialist wars on the promise of being able to get an education, but the last thing we need is more people going to the military. If we can lobby for these things to happen, we can help end racism, sexism, homophobia, and warmongering :)"
