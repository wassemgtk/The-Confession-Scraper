I don't want to sound intolerant, but there really should be some sort of language/speech requirement for lecturers here. I have to drop a class because I don't understand 90% of what the lecturer says. And I don't mean I don't understand what they're saying conceptually, I mean that like 90% of the time I actually don't know what words they are saying. They're not even a particularly good lecturer in the first place, so with the added language/accent barrier, attending their lectures is essentially useless for me.

And it sucks because this class is something I'd love to learn more about, but with all the work I have to do for my other classes, combined with the fact that I don't need this class for my degree, I just can't justify spending time trying to teach myself from the book so that I can complete the work for this class.

Now to be fair, this isn't some major, institute-wide issue. In fact, this is the first time I've experienced this problem with a lecturer. But with how much we pay to be here, this really shouldn't happen at all. Most classes here are difficult enough under perfect circumstances, so it's really disappointing when something like this creates even more difficulties.
