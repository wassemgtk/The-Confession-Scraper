One of my hobbies is going on facebook profiles of my Korean-speaking friends and read comments to their photos written in Korean. It feeds my curiosity of stalking my friends and kinda helps me to learn random colloquialisms they use in Korean. Also I learned that my senior friend is staying for another year MEng'ing only because I could read it in Korean lol.
