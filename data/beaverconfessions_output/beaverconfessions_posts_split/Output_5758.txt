"PalestineMIT and the Arab Students Organization are hosting Dr. Mads Gilbert, who openly supports the 9/11 attacks, because they themselves support any attack on the US. All American universities for a long time occupied by Palestinian activists, who under disguises of being students, stay there for 7-12 years, educating one generation after another of students in anti=Israeli and anti-American hatred. They are supported by leftist organizations on campuses, led very often, as funny as it is, by secular Jews converted to communism. They do not care about Israel and are worshiping "justice" for anyone "oppressed" like blacks, Indians. Now their favorite charity case is Palestinians. Those gullible American idiots just do not understand, that they are raising army of their own murderers."

To the indvidual who wrote this comment on the Tech article about Mads Gilbert,

You are racist and xenophobic.

Sincerely.
