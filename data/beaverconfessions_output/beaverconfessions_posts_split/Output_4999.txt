- More people should be making confessions.
- For example, my ex-UROP supervisor asked me tonight if I wanted to go see a movie.  He is married.  And like >30.  And, by the way, no.  First of all, I thought this was going to be a work meeting, I did f*king excellent work in your lab while you went on coffee breaks, and you're the one who still hasn't written the paper yet, even though I've done all the data analysis for you.
- Second of all, I finally looked up what constitutes sexual harassment today.  And I realized that, two years ago when my other ex-UROP supervisor asked at the beginning of my Freshman IAP if I'd had sex (in hindsight wtf?), and I said no, and he proceeded to describe to me what I was missing out on (at work, mind you, in a low voice), and then, when no one was around, to show some videos.  For me to "better understand."  I realized that this was not, in fact, a favor he was doing me.
- That day when some weird man followed me around.  To the library.  To turn in my pset.  To the stud.  Then finally tapped me on the shoulder and asked me if I had a UROP, because I "looked like I could be a good fit."  He didn't even ask what my major was.  I had to tell him no a second time the next week.
- This is just 3 examples.  I can think of at least one more.
- I can't unsee or unhear any of this.
- For the record: yeah, I'm supposedly attractive.  And that shouldn't have anything to do with this.  I didn't "deserve" it.  F*ck you.  Do you also believe in Social Darwinism?  I’ve come this far because I work really hard, I’m dedicated, passionate, and curious.  I know that, you know that, it’s a fact, and don’t make me or anyone else question it.
- So I'm saying it here.  In the hopes that all of MIT will not unsee and unhear this.
- Please, if anything like this is happening to you.  Or happened.  Get yourself free from that person now.
- And if anyone knows what I should do, let me know.
- Also for the record: if you're one of the few men who doesn't just want sex, then I probably can't sort you out from the rest. Even if you're a great man. Good luck gaining my trust, and sorry I'm stereotyping you (I'm so sorry!). It's called survival, personal experience, and defiance. Sucks for me, and sucks for you.
- I challenge you who are trustworthy to try to break these walls, reminding myself that I need to keep them out of disrepair even while I want them broken down.
- Actually, if you create a culture of harassment, however "mild," the only thing you're doing is helping us all keep our walls strong.  Raising my bar to love.
So don't do it.  You're the one that's losing.  Losing face, and making me stronger, helping me build up my walls (thanks for showing me I need them), making me more driven to succeed, in the face of your weakness.
- But please.  Never do it again.  (Please?)  Because I hear a lot of people don't use it as fuel for their career drive.
- Is this the real reason why there are so few women at the highest levels of academia?  I’m becoming more convinced: being a totally peer-evaluated enterprise, it’s a respect issue on the part of the men.  I can only hope that the rest of my life leads me to consider other possibilities.
