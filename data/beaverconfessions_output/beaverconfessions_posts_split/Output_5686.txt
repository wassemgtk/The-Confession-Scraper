More than half of the students taking 6.004 have not even a single clue what they are doing, but I still give them checkoffs anyway otherwise the queue will overflow. EECS department should really replace 6.01 with a real computer systems class. Most other school students take 6.828 equivalent on sophomore or junior year. How do you even claim yourself to be a computer scientist without knowing how a computer actually work?
