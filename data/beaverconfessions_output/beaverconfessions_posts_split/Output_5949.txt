A friend of mine was furious over the Houston failure to pass the non discrimination ordinance. She argued that nobody should every be allowed to refuse business to anyone in a business. She brought up blacks at the lunch counter argument. I pointed out what about the other side of that? Would you tell a black restaurant owner that he has to serve KKK members walking in dressed in full robes? Would you tell a Jewish Deli owner that he has to serve Neo Nazis in brown shirts? I think forcing people to do business with each other against their will is un American.
