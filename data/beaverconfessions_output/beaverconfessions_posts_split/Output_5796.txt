I'm Asian-American, I don't really feel comfortable with the AAA "Got Fever?" shirts. I understand the idea of owning this phenomenon of yellow fever that's racist and dehumanizing to Asians and Asian-Americans, but I don't know if the shirts are perceived like that. Most of the time, I feel like the shirt is just downplaying the reality of yellow fever by making it into a punchline. Thoughts?
