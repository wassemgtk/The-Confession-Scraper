I'm so tired of the assholes who complain about how unattractive the opposite sex is at MIT. Stop acting like you're hotter than you are. When you say you have zero options at this school, nobody is impressed. You just look like an arrogant prick. There are so many attractive MIT students, and they're also smart and interesting as shit.
