Just like to say that arguments supporting #2230 are at least logically consistent, whereas I doubt everyone else that's against him is. I'm not a sociopathic asshole, I still care about people.

In this instance, the train by default goes straight. Changing the track makes him responsible for the single death, and therefore a murderer. Is he responsible for the five deaths if he does nothing? If yes, then he is responsible for all deaths you could prevent but do nothing about. If not, he has no obligation to pull it.

I think most here would say you should pull the lever. However, if you aren't trying to save as many lives as you can every second of every day when you have the possibility to save them, then you are in some sense responsible for all of those lives. Ignorance of how you can save someone is not an excuse, since you can always use time when you can't save someone to gather more information so that you can.

I'm on the side where I think we should try to save as many people as possible. I also know that I'm not doing as much as I can to save people. Doing this burdens me with extreme guilt, because I recognize that I'm responsible for a large number of deaths. I completely understand and respect why someone wouldn't want to deal with the guilt of blood on their hands.
