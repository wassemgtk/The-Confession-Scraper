I feel like I'm stuck in limbo. On one hand there are the undergrads, who often go out of their way to point out how old we are compared to them. There's also that not-so-subtle disdain about how we're not "real" MIT students, which I just love. And on the other hand there are my fellow graduate students, so many of whom are getting married and talking about kids and crap. Where any geeky hobby is only admitted under duress as some kind of guilty pleasure. Why isn't there a culture where we can just be ourselves? I don't care if you're married or just got out of high school. I don't care what course you are. I want to enjoy my twenties and not have to be ashamed of myself. Let's be silly together. Let's play board games and video games and get drunk. Let's debate the nature of the universe. I'm so tired of the age group clicks.
