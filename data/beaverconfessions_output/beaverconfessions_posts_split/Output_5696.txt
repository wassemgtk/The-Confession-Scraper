Honest question: could a pro-Palestinian user offer a response to #2720 that goes "there exist expert opinions that support my side but I'm not going to quote them or tell you where they are," snide sarcasm, or ad hominem attacks? 

As a (relatively) neutral person, I do think 2720 raises some legitimate points (albeit the aggressive tone) and I think discussion of these points is more productive than cherry-picking parts of the post to ridicule.
