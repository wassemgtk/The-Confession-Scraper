Men say the damndest things you know. Let me say it again. Men say the damndest things. Donald trump continues to make ignorant, degrading and highly inaccurate comments about the Latino race every time it  he steps to a podium. Kayne West continually insists that aside from being considered "The Greatest Rapper in the World, his name should also be included in future editions of the king james bible. Charlie sheen, after causing $7,000 worth of damage at a hotel just months after a reported assault on his third wife had the audacity to go on national television and announce that he was winning. Men, I will repeat "Say the damndest things. But of all the damndest, of all the foul, of all the crooked and vulgar things that a man could expunge from the hole in his face he identifies as his mouth can not do justice to the depravity that expunged out of one mongrels townies mouth while I was walking in Charlestown yesterday evening. Being that it is February and the weather is to some degree getting a tad bit warmer I decided that perhaps the time hap come to wear something a tad bit more comfortable and possibly a little more revealing. I looked into my closet and found y wardrobe for that day. I exited my dorm room at exactly 10:15 on the dot yesterday. I'd been invited to Charlestown for a party that was to be held by my roommates cousin. Being a stranger to Boston, having resided down south in Houston, Texas all my life I had no knowledge of Charlestown. That is with the exception from that time I saw "the town" at tommy whexlers party in the ninth grade. Beyond that my knowledge was limited. The party was badass and the food was off the hook. Though not as glamorous as the area surrounding Mit, I will admit it has a certain gruff style about it. I thoroughly enjoyed myself. That is until it was time to go. While walking down the sidewalk back to the subway that would take us from Charlestown back to our destination we encountered what my friend later identified to me as a townie. I don't rember the exact definition she gave me as to what this particular breed of man was. I'm not even concerned with the definition she gave me. What mattered was his comment. a comment so vulgar, so dehumanizing, so nasty that it makes me insides boil up like hot water, my head burn like fire, and my entie body to shake with rage and fury. "GIRL, WHEN I"M DONE WIT YOU U GONNA BE SQUIRTIN, AND SCREAMIN, AND SHAKIN ALL OVER THE GODDAMN PLACE. SKIT,SKIT,MOTHERFUCKUCKA, GODDAMN!" If i'd had a gun idda popped a cap in his ass. If I had been in possession of a pocket Knife, id have castrated him. If id had peper spray I'd go up and spray the entire goddamn bottle in his eyes. Fortunately for him I was in possession of none of this items. Fortunately for me there was one thing I did and will always possess. My voice. Ladies, let me tell you something bout a woman's voice. A womans voice is the most valuable thing  a woman could ever have.  a voice is all the thing a woman ever needs. In the 1920s when men said that women were not intellectually capable nor necessary to the voting process Susan B Anthony said blatantly "Fuck That> In 1955 when White male police officers in Alabama told Rosa Parks to get off the bus and move to the back of the bus after a long day of standing on her knees, she said "Fuck That. In 1989 during a live television broadcast of the David lettermen show, the host in question had the audacity to remark on the current weight of one oprah winfrey and furthermore thought his comments to be justified. she said "Fuck That" So when this spineless, needledick dweeb had the audacity to sit on his stoop and call out to me in such a manner I did what women throughout history have and I pray, will continue to do when a man feels that he can speak to you in a dehumanizing matter. I said fuck that.  Look here you dickless piece of shit. I don't what you think this is but I aint the motherfucking one! You hear me I ain't the motherfucking one! Youre gonna have me squirting and screaming?! As if id waste my time spreading my legs for that tootsie role dick. Go home and give it a tug. Youre jacked up, you hear me jacked up. You heads jacked up you, your face is jacked up, your bodys jacked up, youre just a plain jackass. You must be a jackass to think that I would ever under any circumstances respond to a man informing me that I am nothing more than an object for him to eject his smelly infertile load on. You must be a jackass to assume that I who am talented  female currently receiving and education at one of the finest schools in the country would ever lower herself to do such a thing. you must be a jackass to throw such shade at a girl who is spirited, beautiful, funny, and downright badass. Im a woman. Mother of the earth. The cradle of civilization. The giver of life and it all its miraculous wonders. I am a fucking gift. A gift that shitheels like you don't or care to recognize. Now, where you come from, tht kind of behavior may be tolerated. Girls may respond to such outrageous and vulgar coometns. But, Im a lady goddammit! and I demand to be treated the way a lady should be treated. So if, EVER I AM IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD, AND WE CROSS PATHS  AND YOU MAKE AS VULGAR AND DEHUMANISING A STATEMENT AS THE ONE YOU JUST MADE IMMA PUT YOU IN A HEADLOCK, BEND YOU OVER THAT RAIL, AND PUT MY HIGH HEELED SHOE SO FAR UP YOUR ASS YOUR GONNA HAVE TOES FOR TEETH! Men say the damndest things I tell ya. Men say the damndest things.
