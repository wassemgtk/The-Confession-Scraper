I just want to spread a message that isn't 1) extremely depressing, or 2) trolling. There's so much negativity on this page, and I would say its just a tiny sample size of the population.

I love MIT. And no, I'm not a new freshman, so don't say, "just wait." It's challenging, tests are sometimes just unfair, and some professors are horrible teachers. I've had some friends deal with depression and anxiety, and sometimes I question if I do myself. I've seen people crack under pressure. That happens at literally all colleges. But I've also seen people absolutely love the things they are doing. And get excited about classes, UROPs, or clubs/sports. Everyone goes through a bit of a struggle (some more than others). But to overarchingly say that MIT is "hopeless," has "extra bullshit," or is a "living hell" is a bit exaggerated. I really do believe the administration cares about us and are trying really hard to make sure we are taken care of. Some people have bad experiences. Yes, it isn't perfect. But no place is perfect.

I love MIT, and I really hope and believe a majority of students feel the same way.
