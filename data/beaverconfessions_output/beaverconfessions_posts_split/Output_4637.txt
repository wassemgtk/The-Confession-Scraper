To the small-but-loud collection of 2018s freaking the fuck out about various aspects of their Brass Rat:

It's a class ring.  It's not a "me" ring.  Some parts of your ring might not be 100% relevant to you, but that doesn't mean you should fly off the handle and attack individuals who are related to those parts.  RingComm designed the ring to include features relevant to the *collective* Class of 2018.  No Brass Rat can perfectly represent 1,100 individual members of the Class of 2018.  Some of you may not identify with or understand certain components of your ring.  But what's on there is probably fairly important to your collective identity if 12 of your peers hailing from a diverse set of living groups all agreed that it is important to your collective identity.  The 2018 Brass Rat is creative, unique, and representative of your collective identity.  If you still want a "me" ring, then stop being an cowardly asshole to people that genuinely care about you, get off of MIT Confessions, and go to a fucking jewelry store.

Sincerely,
A perplexed senior
