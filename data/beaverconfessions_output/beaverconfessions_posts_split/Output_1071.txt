I'm in love with my best friend, but I'd rather see him with another girl. I've had a bad history of past relationships falling apart, and I'm scared that this would happen if we ever become more than just friends. I don't want to date him for a while, break up, and then never talk again. I'm more scared of completely losing him from my life than seeing him happy with someone else.
