So even when I'm super hosed (like right now), I try to stay positive, especially around other people who are also hosed.  My logic is that maybe if they're not completely surrounded by misery and psets and exams looming on the horizon, they'll feel a little better and be happier/more productive.
But when I crack, I really REALLY crack.  I get sad, I cry a little, I hate everything, I isolate myself or calmly tell people I can't avoid that I just don't want to see anyone right now.  The people I hold close to me are suddenly fucking annoying.  I get jealous of people who are more hosed because I feel like they're smarter than me for taking harder classes, and I get jealous of people who are less hosed than me because they can handle their shit better than I can.  The only person who's seen me crack is someone who doesn't even go here and is in another country right now but still loves me to death.  I'm afraid of cracking again and not having anyone to help me through it when I need someone.
