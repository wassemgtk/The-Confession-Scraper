This one time I took a ridged dildo on my carry-on because I didn't want it to get lost in checked baggage.  TSA took it off to the side because apparently in the x-ray the dildo looked like the handle of a handgun.

The look on the TSA lady's face was priceless, but props to her for being professional and not judging.
