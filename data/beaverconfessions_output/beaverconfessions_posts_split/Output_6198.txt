Course 6 gives ~*~zero fucks~*~ about its students. Someone told me they've yet to meet a single professor that demonstrated they really cared. I certainly haven't. Maybe its because all the class sizes are so big; I dunno, but someone needs to do something about it, because this is ridiculous y'all.
