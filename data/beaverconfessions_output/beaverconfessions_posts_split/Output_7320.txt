Rejection stings. No matter how hard I try, I am constantly rejected, by "friends," by girls, by student groups, and by internships. I feel rejected by life. There is not one thing that I can do right. Everywhere I go, I am the butt of other people's jokes. I am running out of things to cling on to. Some people struggle academically but have a large support group, while others excel in their fields but might feel lonely. I'm a complete failure, academically and socially. I feel like I am wasting my time and others' each and every day. I am there but it doesn't matter to them. No one takes me seriously. I want out.
