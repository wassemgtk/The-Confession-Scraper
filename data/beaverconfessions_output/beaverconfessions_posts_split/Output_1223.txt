Dear #7208, if you openly admit to hating on bioengineers and electrical engineers, then you don't get to call yourself an engineer either. If anything, teamwork is the most crucial aspect of engineering. And frankly, I do not see how a despicable envious degenerate contemptible imbecilic coward -like yourself- would ever be able to work effectively in a real team on cutting-edge research that require the integration of people from different disciplines. As an aspiring engineer, I hope I never get to experience the embarrassment of sharing the title with you. 

Now on course 20 hatred. I believe it is ultimate jealousy. I bet you couldn't stand the rate at which bioengineers are making history. I bet it bothers you so badly that just two days ago, your facebook feed was overflowing with articles about Robert Langer, a bioengineer, and his new polymer that might turn wrinkles into history. 

The only thing worse than your manners is your logic. You cannot possibly survive course 20 at MIT if you despise math, mechanics, design etc. It is just not worth the GPA drop, and certainly not worth the near-mental state you reach when you are forced to learn both the biology and engineering cores and perform actual research at a lab that is not your bed. 

I do not know how to reply to your course 6 bashing. If course 20 is relatively new and is deserving of a lengthy explanation for simple-minded people like yourself, course 6 is not, and I refuse to elaborate on why  I think it makes you seem like a world-class unreservedly pathetic douche.
