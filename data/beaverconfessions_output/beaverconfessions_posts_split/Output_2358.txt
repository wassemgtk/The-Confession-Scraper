We are trolled into believing there is existence; but even the Cosmic Troll is a product of trolling; and we, ourselves, are trolled into existence. This fundamental trolling, the dynamic activity starting from nothing and going back to nothing, doesn't troll something external to itself, but trolls its own very trolling in the act of trolling, thus creating the absolute appearance, or show, trolling us into existence.

Plebs will think this is a troll.
