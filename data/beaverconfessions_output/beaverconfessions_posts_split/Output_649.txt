Guys. I am a senior and have gone through worse than what you can think of as a freshman at MIT. I had friends who were either extremely lazy and demotivated or extremely narcissistic. Were they friends? Not really. They just gave me some space in their lives. I got really bad grades as a freshman. Then a senior and I got talking in the reading room. He helped me understand my goals. He helped me motivate myself and told me, 'Dude you have like three years to buckle up. Work your ass off and you will be in heaven for the rest of your life.' I don't know about the rest of my life, but currently I am in heaven. I started my research in my sophomore year and found my girlfriend right after. She wasn't the one I wasted my freshman year on. The one I got wasted on has has four boyfriends already and denies each one of them, just to get PSETS done by the boys. What a sucker. So glad I got my lovely girl. I am likely to attend Grad school here too. There is nothing like MIT. Guys girls, stop the dick pussy conversation. You will get loads of either or once you are successful.
