I want to be charming, confident, tall, beautiful. I want to have perfect skin, a hobby that I'm good at, and a great sense of fashion. I wish my hair was long and wavy. I wish I don't eat entire boxes of oreos on a daily basis. I wish I looked good in a bikini. I wish I can turn some heads. I hate how I want any of those things, but I still want them sooo bad.
