I have insomnia and I've been smoking weed at night so I can actually fall asleep. I've tried taking regular sleeping pills and bunch of others that my therapist prescribed to me. But either they are too strong and leave me super drowsy the next day or they are too weak and doesn't make me fall asleep. Weed has been so far the only thing that's been reliably working AND doesn't make me drowsy the next day. I'm not sure if I'll get in trouble telling that to a medical personnel so I've been lying about smoking. But nowadays my weed dealer has been really finicky and has been postponing delivering it to me. I'm already out of weed and been unable to fall asleep at a decent hour for the past couple days. I only know that one weed dealer and I'm not sure where else I can get weed. I thought about trying to get a medical marijuana certification, but I don't know if insomnia/depression/anxiety issue is enough of a "problem" to get the certification. Also I don't know how much more expensive it'll be to go through that process especially since the only legal weed dispensary in MA is far from campus... UGGGGHHHH
