I hate my capstone class.  Not because of my project or the time commitment.  I hate how disorganized it is.  The only thing my department has actually accomplished is reserve a room to show powerpoints in, and then proceed to do fuck-all.  All these promises of a "revamped course leading to greater quality of projects" might as well have come from Nixon for all the truth it held.

And fucking petty drama between admins who can't get over their collective ego's directly fucked with my project.

Why is it that the only class I've hated in my major is the only 1 I can't fudge to graduate?
