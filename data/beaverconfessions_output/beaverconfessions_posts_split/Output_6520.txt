There's an argument I've been hearing a lot lately after the popes visit that I feel is very dishonest. Some people here have told me that if the Catholic church changed its stance on gay marriage young people like us would come back to the church. Let's stop with that nonsense. Me not going to church had nothing to do with their views of gays. I don't go for the same reason most of us don't go. I don't want to change my lifestyle. I don't want to attend mass, I don't want to stop having sex with women who I'm not married to nor in a relationship with. I don't want to help out at a soup kitchen. I don't want to have kids. I don't want to do because screw those challenges. Gay rights have absolutely nothing to do with it for most of us.
