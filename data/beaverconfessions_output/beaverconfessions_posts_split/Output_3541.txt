I'm generally a pessimist about Course VI classes, but I'd like to take a moment to give a shout out to the staff of 6.004. 6.004 is probably the one class I've taken here where the staff and instructors make it a point that they want you to learn the material, and to learn it well. They provide an endless amount of resources and make themselves so easily accessible to the students. Thank you, guys. You guys make me genuinely love going to class.
