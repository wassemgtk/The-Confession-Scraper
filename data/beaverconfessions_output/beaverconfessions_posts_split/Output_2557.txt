What is offensive about the "inner city kids" post? Like I understand not thinking it's funny. I even understand seeing it and thinking "that might be a little inappropriate". But the idea that an adult could be so disturbed by viewing a joke someone posted on social media that they feel compelled to angrily call the person out in a public forum is baffling to me. He needs to be "held accountable" for posting a completely benign joke on facebook? Are you even real people? 

And then when the dude is nice enough to apologize for something he should in no way have to apologize for at all, you whiny dicks have the balls to complain that his apology wasn't posted publicly enough, or didn't demonstrate enough remorse? You write a whole comment saying you don't think he understands why his post was "offensive" and how you won't forgive him until he demonstrates that he understands why his post was so "problematic", but you don't even give a single reason explaining why you found it offensive in the first place. You look forward to seeing him educate himself? Well if you're such an enlightened being, why don't you help "educate" him?

The only ignorance he displayed in making that post was ignorance to how many bitchy little weirdos are evidently enrolled at MIT.

I don't know why I'm even bothering to make this post. It's certainly not going to get anyone to look at things any differently than they already do. It's not going to accomplish anything, other than giving you guys something else to take offense to. There will probably be a few comments explaining how stupid and "problematic" my attitude is. But whatever. I really just needed to let you people who were brave and heroic and enlightened enough to be offended by a joke what enormous pricks you are.
