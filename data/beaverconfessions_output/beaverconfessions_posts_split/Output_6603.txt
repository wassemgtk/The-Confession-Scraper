There's a time that I admire people who do the little things in life that make everybody's life better. And then there's the time I walk in the first and second floors of the student center and I realize that there are people in this world who leave their garbage on the tables and chairs because they think the custodians are servants. They are humans who make a living by cleaning up the student center, to make it presentable. They attempt to make a positive environment for us so we can study and eventually make the world better. However, they shouldn't have to pick up rice, dirty napkins, and sticky sandwiches from the tables for you. Stop being lazy and just throw it in the trash can or recycle bin, whichever is appropriate. Spend an extra 3 minutes a day so that the facilities can have more time to focus on what they should. And, lastly, stop complaining that the facilities don't do enough. I'm sick of hearing people who quack around about MIT's maintenance being bad -- first, save them some time by being humane. 

MIT is about the sense of community. It's the people that make it the place it is -- the best place in the world. Thoughtless people who want to do nothing for the community are people who ruin this reputation. I can't believe there are actually people who don't feel this sense of belonging. Would you not help your family in every way possible even if it took half your life? All it takes is a few minutes of consideration every day. For your family -- MIT.
