My parents never really graduated from college. What I mean by that, is my dad dropped out of college and joined the military; my mom got a degree while being in the military, and a master's while working full-time. So not the traditional college experience. My brother dropped out of college multiple times, and never graduated.

It is so hard sometimes being at MIT, with all of its intense schoolwork and pressures, and not being able to really talk about it with my family. They just don't understand. And when everyone else's parents have PhD's or are rich, and talk about the world from this high-level and having never really worried about whether they will live a good life (not as in, a better life; but as in, will I have a house?), it is difficult to relate. They understand all of the opportunities that come with a good education, while I have absolutely no idea. I have never known what it is like to live in a family with college degrees and well-paying jobs. They know what doors are open to people with such backgrounds - I have no idea what doors will open, or even what a college degree is necessarily granting to me. All I know is that getting a degree from MIT is a good thing.

I don't even really have a network of people that went through college and got an education. I don't even know how to build such a network - not in my twenties, when it seems like everyone with money and degrees are all in cliques, committed to helping everyone else with money and degrees that they've known since they were tiny, as neighbors or family. I feel all alone, with no network to build a life on.

I also have no real cultural ties to help build such connections. I am as bland as you can get with my background. There are no clubs or groups organized around anything associated with where I come from or who I am, that people would normally network with. I am majoritarian in every way, except that I come from a lesser-educated socioeconomically challenged background; which, in New England, is really hard. There's definitely a stigma, some judgment and a glass ceiling associated with that. I also feel guilty in some ways also, because I know that I should have so much privilege that comes with most of my background - but it really doesn't feel like it. Am I not using it correctly? Eugh, that sounds terrible just saying it. And, again, it's not as if that is an appropriate thing to talk about in public.

I can't even say I am 'First Generation', because my mom has some form of 'college background', even though it was radically different from what we think of as college.

As a result, sometimes I feel like a mote of dust blowing in the wind, with little control and no idea where I will end up - at a disadvantage to everything around me that is rooted in the ground and aware of how to use its surroundings. It hits me hard sometimes - causing me to slack in schoolwork and missing classes - but then I feel guilty, get worried that I will follow my brother, or disappoint my family, and go back to work. And I don't know who I can really talk to about any of this; if you know me, you would probably never guess that it was me writing this confession. And if I do talk about it with other people, it almost seems like I am ungrateful for what I have, or the work of my parents, or as if I am ashamed of my brother (which I am not).

Anyway, just kind of venting. Thanks for reading. I guess I'll throw in a random 'deep thought' to make it worthwhile - always go through life meeting people and remembering that there is much more underneath than what you may see on the surface. We all have our challenges that we struggle with inside.
