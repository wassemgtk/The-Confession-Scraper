I suffer from this terrible feeling that everyone secretly hates me. Every time I leave a room, I imagine my friends saying "thank god they're gone" or "what a loser, I can't believe we have to deal with them". I know it's irrational, but I constantly feel like a joke, like I don't belong, like everyone is out to get me. Am I the only one that feels this way?
