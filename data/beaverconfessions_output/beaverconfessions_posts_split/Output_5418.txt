I appreciate the rigor of the courses here, but sometimes I feel that the amount of work and the "tough it out" mentality of TAs/profs here just beats the fun and joy out of learning. There are way too many classes where I'll walk in excited and pumped about the material only to have that interest literally killed by the end of the semester.
