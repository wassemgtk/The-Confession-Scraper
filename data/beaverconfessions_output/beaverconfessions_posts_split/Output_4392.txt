I have trouble reconciling how ridiculous some political ideologies seem to me with how many people subscribe to those ideologies. I refuse to believe that such a large number of people are simply out of their minds, but I still cannot take their viewpoints seriously. Does this indicate some form of intolerance or want of empathy in myself? Do I have any more right to feel secure in my beliefs than they do? Abstract questions of human rights and a moral contract are easy to construct because a dominating majority is in agreement. However, when such a large number of people disagree on political issues such as how to enforce these rights, who is to say my "educated" and "reasonable" viewpoint is more or less valid than another's "ridiculous" opinion?
