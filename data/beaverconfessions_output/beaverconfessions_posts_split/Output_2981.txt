When you get matched with someone you think is hot on dildo.io but you are in an exclusive relationship (and when you asked your partner if it could be non-exclusive they were very not okay with that) (welp) (do I bring it up again with my partner?) (rate 0/10 dildo.io is making me reconsider my life choices and I just don't have time for that)
