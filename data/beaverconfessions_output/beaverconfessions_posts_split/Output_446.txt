'm sad because all my friends are happy right now and I just know pretty soon they'll all be miserable and we'll slowly drift apart as the semester goes on... and PSETs will gradually just drive everyone into their own separate rooms night after night. This all seems so ephemeral right now. Everyone's so happy, and it can't last.
