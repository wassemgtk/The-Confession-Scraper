I like how none of the comments on the confession about diversity being forced only in majority white countries didn't actually answer the question but just diverted to spewing their familiar rhetoric. Facts are if you truly want to promote diversity you would fight as equally for diversity in countries like Japan, South Korea, Saudi Arabia, Morocco and Botswana. Some people are so comfy in their echo chamber that they fail to see their hypocrisy.

Oh and btw, defining "whiteness" as possesing privilege from the status quo, while at the same time isolating minority groups as being marginalized is hilariously ironic
