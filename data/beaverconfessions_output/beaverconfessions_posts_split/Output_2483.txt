I'm a high school student who has fallen in love with MIT. It started with the OCW in 8th grade, reading lots and lots research papers published by MIT affiliates, and working w/ alumni in my research internship. 

Problem is, this attraction is going to end in getting in my heart getting broken in 2 years.. Just out of curiosity, are there people who got into MIT from rural, unknown high schools with average extracurriculars w/o winning the IMO, IPhO, IChO, etc..? Thanks in advance for reading this; I know you guys are pretty busy.
