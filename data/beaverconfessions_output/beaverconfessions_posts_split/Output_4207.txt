I messed up so badly and I am so sad. This is why I should never talk to people I like and who might like me – I’ll just talk to them too much. To make matters worse, we both have so many exams next week and I’ve just gone and messed up everything like an idiot. The worst part is, I like this person a lot, and now I’m afraid I’ve ruined everything. I was just about over them two weeks ago – I thought they didn’t like me at all. And then I had to go and ask them about it. I shouldn’t have done it. I would be in better shape now, thinking that they didn't like me, rather than knowing they liked me at some point, and probably don't like me anymore.
