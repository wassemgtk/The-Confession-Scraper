Both political parties have good ideas, take the best from each.

Those of you on the left, understand that the right wants to maintain the society we have. We want a society that allows free discourse of all ideas. A society that is tolerant of all ideas cannot import people who are intolerant of all ideas, as that is destructive to that society. Whether you wish to acknowledge it or not, Western liberal ideas are primarily held by those who are from Western liberal societies and those that have been influenced by Western liberal societies. Immigrants must assimilate into our culture for our society to survive. Most individuals from certain cultural backgrounds have shown themselves incapable of assimilation. We cannot allow these people into our society. A tolerant society paradoxically must be intolerant of those who are intolerant.

Those on the right, understand that the left is fighting for equality of opportunity for all people regardless of who you are. Just as you are opposed to socialism because it takes money from those who work and gives it to those who do not, you must also be opposed to allowing dynasties of elites to form, as is the case in libertarian societies. When your parents die, you receive money you did not work for. You have no claim to that money, and thus a society must make the funds available to the public. Give every individual the chance to become a leader. Competition breeds strength.

The Meritocracy Party is the only political organization promoting an agenda that will eliminate dynasties of wealth, provide equal opportunity to all people, and maintain our society and culture.
