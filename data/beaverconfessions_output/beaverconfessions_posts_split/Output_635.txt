On the Uber leaving MIT to go to Boston-Logan, I looked down dorm row twinkled with rooms that are still lit at 2AM, and felt a surge of feels. I started crying realizing how much I would miss this place over the summer. MIT is a beautifuly painful place, and I wouldn't have it any other way. Thanks for a great year!
