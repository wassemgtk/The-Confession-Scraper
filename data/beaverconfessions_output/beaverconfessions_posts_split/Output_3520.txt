I am seriously hindered by my organizational skills. I have no priorities other than my education - I let my life go to shit just to learn. My single parent was a hoarder, and from a young age that is what I became used to. There were times when I was very young that I slept on the floor of my room for months because there was too much stuff on my bed. I can't even bring myself to describe anything more, but my home always felt associated with isolation, depression, and clutter. 

My life is a fucking mess, mentally and physically. I continue to exhibit some of the same characteristics. It's depressing, shameful, and exhausting. I have been to therapy a few times before, but my issues have never been taken seriously. I must deal with this on my own because people will just think I am lazy and lack will-power.

I am proud of myself for getting into an amazing university and doing well in spite of the total lack of guidance in my life. I love what I study, and that alone is probably what has kept me alive. I don't know how or if I can change, but I am afraid I won't be able to reach my potential in my studies if I do not.
