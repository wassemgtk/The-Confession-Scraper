@4194... yeah, I loved the part where they all used viagra. the whole thing came off as like "we live in senior house, we're so cool and edgy!!". unfunny and the actors faked pleasure pretty bad, really hammed it up, yet took themselves way too seriously at the same time. it's not art, it's a shitty college porno, and you embarrassed yourselves. if you we'rent there, people were laughing tbh
