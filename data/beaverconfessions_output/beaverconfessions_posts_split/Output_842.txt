genuinely curious: what good can going to mental health counseling do if I don't want to be prescribed medication? like, i went and told them my problems but it didn't feel like it was actually helping. I just felt really vulnerable and then we scheduled another appointment and that was it. I don't feel like I should be disappointed in the experience because I didn't know what I even wanted to get out of going to mental health, anyway
