When someone comments "message me" after one of these posts, do you guys actually mean it or are you just saying that? I have posted a few confessions where people said "message me" and I've really thought about doing that. But I feel like it's sort of like when people ask "how are you doing" and you are expected to say "I'm good" no matter how you feel. If I actually messaged one of you would it be weird?
