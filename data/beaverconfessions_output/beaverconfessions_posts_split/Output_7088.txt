Sometimes I get jealous of the little kids I see in the playground outside Stata D-Entrance. I wish I were one of them, free of obligations and not worried about disappointing everyone with expectations of me. And being 19, being almost done with teenagerhood doesn't help. I'm not ready to be an adult.
