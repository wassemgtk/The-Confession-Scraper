I feel like there are so many terrible stories about professors not caring about the students and how strict and unsympathetic they are about personal/medical issues getting in the way of academics. I do not doubt the validity of these stories, but I feel like it paints an unrepresentative picture of the professors as a whole. I, personally, have had positive experiences with many professors that I've had and truly felt like many have cared about my own academic success. Not all are as caring as some are, but many have gone through exams with me after I have done poorly to identify what my weak spots were and what strategies I could employ to do better in the future. Most have been accommodating when I miss class for interviews or athletics. When I have been ill or physically injured, and I go to S^3, they have been generous with extending deadlines, pushing off exams, and even sometimes excusing exams when I have been concussed. They are not always 100% accommodating, but in my own personal experiences, they have been pretty reasonable most of the time. I think that there are definitely exceptions, but overall, they're not that bad.
