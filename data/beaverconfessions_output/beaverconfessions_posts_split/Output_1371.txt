My RFP has been sitting in Mary Mango's inbox for weeks, waiting for reimbursement for money I laid out for CPW. I need the money for my summer travel; I am not a bank!  When is MIT going to realize that this method isn't fair to students?  Why should we have to wait so long to get our money back?  And why isn't this woman going through her inbox and processing our reimbursements???
