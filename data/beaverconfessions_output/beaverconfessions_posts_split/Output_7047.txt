Everybody seems to always be talking about how academically overwhelmed they are at MIT. I'm not overwhelmed academically. But I want to scream at these people, at least you have friends. And people who will support you in talking about being overwhelmed. I'm that kid who always appears to be coasting and acing life, but if I say so everyone will hate me, so I just say I'm busy, just like everyone else. In reality I don't have any close friends and my life is pretty unsatisfying. I missed out on making a lot of close friendships my freshman year due to relationships and other things. I'm in a fucking sorority, but when I walk into a room full of my sisters, I realize that hardly any of them are really my friends. I say hi to some of them in the hallways and that's about it. Some of them look the other way when I walk past. I would disaffiliate, but I'm so close to the end now that it seems like a waste of years of dues money not to become a lifetime member. I get really happy and really sad every time I think about graduating because I'm so happy to get out of this place where I have no friends, but so sad because I expected to make the best friends of my life here. Yes, it's probably largely my fault for being bad at reaching out to people, but seriously? Not one person has noticed that I'm desperately lonely and have been since the start?
