When my roommate succeeds at something, whether it's an internship or a UROP, I get excited for her from the bottom of my heart, literally. But when I have good news, her face turns blank, and she either tries to belittle my motives or nod nonchalantly. How can you be successful when you're full of greed, envy, and unkindness? I'm tired of being nice.
