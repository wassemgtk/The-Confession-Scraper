People always complain about how awful Saferide is, but I think they need to get over it because a 15 minute walk really isn't so bad. In fact, it's good for you! People need to enjoy and embrace the walk. Especially when waiting for the bus takes longer overall and you might get colder just standing there waiting for it. You have a super easy commute. When you graduate it's gonna get so much worse.
