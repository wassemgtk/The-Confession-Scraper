Whenever I'm having struggles, I like to open up to my friends about it and maybe get some advice. However, I notice that my friends are now all going through their own struggles. I'm trying my best to be there for them, but they refuse to open up to me. I want to help out and return the favor, and it just annoys me that they're depriving me of that opportunity. I can't talk to them about this though because, like I said, they're all having their own struggles to deal with right now.

I'm also not sure if I should continue to tell them my struggles, because it just seems unfair of me to do that. I really don't know how to deal with a situation like this. These are my closest friends, and I don't want to be pushed away...
