About three things I was absolutely positive of. First, the Logs are can sing, dance and now even ACT!? Second, there was a part of them - and I didn't know how dominant that part might be - that can somehow run laps around Kresge and still sound like angels. And third, I was unconditionally, irrevocably in love with them...all of them.
