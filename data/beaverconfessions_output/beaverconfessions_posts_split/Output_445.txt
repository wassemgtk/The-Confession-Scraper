I don't follow the anti-suicide attitudes of MIT. As far as I can tell, if someone is committing suicide, that means their life is such a horrible hell that they can't handle carrying on, and death is a better alternative. If they're killing themself, doesn't that mean that some sort of suffering has been cut short? Isn't that good?

I'm sorry that this is probably a bad opinion... But that's why it's called MIT Confessions.
