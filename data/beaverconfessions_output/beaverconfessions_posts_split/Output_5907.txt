I read some really disturbing news from the department of education today for colleges handling sexual assault. They are encouraging girls at colleges who are sexually assaulted to go to the school and report it first. I say to the women here to please do not do this. Go to the police and the police only, immediately. The police can get the rapist put in jail where he belongs. If you go to the school, they will do everything possible to sweep it under the rug because they don't want the bad press. On top of that the most they can do is expel the guy, that's a dream come true for a rapist. No criminal charges. In fact, he could even drop out during the proceedings, the proceedings will not be completed, and then transfer to another school where the previous school cannot legally disclose his sexual assault investigation. I know it's scary to face the police, but the school is not here to look out for students, it's here to look out for itself.
