Let's say every MIT student wishes to be at least average (i.e. aims to score at least marginally better than his peers). If a student is below average, this condition will haunt them and they will increase their time spent studying in order to fulfill this goal. As individuals adjust their work habits to meet or exceed the average, then over time, the average performance/work ethic of students will increase. This will in turn result in standards for "average" being raised, and grade cutoffs will over time adjust to be tougher than they were in the past, so MIT will very subtly, over many years, become a more difficult place than it was before. As this process marches on, students will (again, slowly but surely) begin to feel overworked, tired, and subject to harsher expectations. These harsher conditions were not set rationally by any human, but are the result of a social mechanism which works slowly enough to not be obvious to those involved. They will seem "normal," and any individual who does not submit to them will be "lazy" or inferior.

After many years, people will start to realize that something isn't exactly right. There will be crisis - momentary collapse - and there will be pushback. Initially, the people in power will move to treat the symptoms of a broken system (more committees! mental health staff!) to quell the feelings of unrest. Things will seem like they are getting better, until another crisis; another tragedy. 

Before long, a consciousness will start to develop. Students will reject the work ethic, and become aware of the absurdity of the system. They will refuse to stand for it, or to believe there is something wrong with them for having the self respect to care for, and enjoy, themselves. Of course, real change cannot be attained by individuals acting alone. As long as the system remains in place, individual dissenters will be stigmatized and crushed by the dominant ideology.

Thus, the only permanent solution to such a system can be mass collective action to overthrow the existing conditions. Though it will require an intricately planned, organized struggle, the fall of the crushing work ethic and the victory of the students are equally inevitable. Let the administration tremble at a revolution. The students have nothing to lose but their chains. They have a world to win.
