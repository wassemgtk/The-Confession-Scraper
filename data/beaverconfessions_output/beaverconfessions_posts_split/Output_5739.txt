I'm a girl and I'm sexually attracted to women and men. But I'm hesitant to call myself "bisexual" or identify with the LGBT acronym because I feel like people are prejudiced against bisexual girls who they view as claiming to be bisexual just for attention. And I feel like I don't have enough "bisexual cred" to actually call myself bisexual because I've hooked up with girls but never dated one.
