I have a really hard time ending conversations with people even when I have no time to trash. Like, I just keep on rambling to my old high school friends about random shit. After our 3 hour convo, I feel so exhausted and guilty. How do you end a convo without sounding rude, inconsiderate, and narcissistic?
