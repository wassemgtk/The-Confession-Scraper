Its finals week and I am doing everything other than studying. Its not because I dont like my subjects or I am good at them. I lost all motivation to study, more like I dont see what I will be able to make out of doing all this when none of these have improved my personal life in any tangible way in so many years. I made my way all the way from a Bachelors to a Masters to now a PhD here at MIT and ignored / gave up on personal life all the way. Now that I am finally here, I have nothing to look forward to or live for. I am in a huge rut and it has been coming. I don't even know how to come out of this. I am nowhere close to being socially awkward or a nerd. I had some great friends over the way but I always sucked when it came to asking a girl out - so much that it took me a long long time to even ask one out. I had a couple of bad relationships and decided to focus on getting into MIT instead. Moving here, I feel intimidated by the pace at which people work and I just save myself the upcoming embarrassment. I am no longer sure what to do next, or why I am even writing this.
