I was diagnosed with schizophrenia several years ago. People close to me can tell that I am obviously mentally ill. I am so tired of being called crazy. People pretend to give a shit about mental illness but in real life the same people will treat you like dirt if you have a severe mental illness. I wish they could understand that I don't want to be like this either.
