I was hanging out in Macgregor one night with some friends, and I really had this urge to poop.  So while everyone was working in the lounge i went to the bathroom...but I couldn't hold it long enough and ended up pooping in the trashcan.  I was so embarrassed that I just covered it up with paper towels and pretended like it never happened.
