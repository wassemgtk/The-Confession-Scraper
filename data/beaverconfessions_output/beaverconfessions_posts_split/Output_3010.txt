From first principles, I agree that having one set of gender neutral pronouns would be the way to go. However, starting with the current (heavily gendered) state of the english language (and pronouns), I am not aware of a reasonable way to transition to a single pronoun. Each person having their own pronouns is impractical (this is what names are for). IMO, the singular "they" is unwieldy. It seems like some community would need to build internal consensus around a single pronoun and then try to popularize it.

People who don't like "he" and "she": is there a plan?
