So I was walking on the BU bridge, coming back to campus, and this asshole on a bike ran a red light, nearly ran me down, and cursed me off as if i was in the wrong. I took the only sensible option and ran the motherfucker down in the middle of traffic. once he realized i almost had him, he hightailed it like a little bitch and I cursed him off as he rode off. A minute later, I was on the sidewalk walking home and he apparently rode around the block to try and find me. when he did he spat on me. and ran away, again, like a little bitch. 

I don't know if you can see this you sack of dog feces, but if you can, I feel sorry for everyone who pretends to be your friend so they dont get shot in your eventual columbine-esque rampage.
