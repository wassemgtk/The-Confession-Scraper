Last week, I saw a girl crying in a bathroom. Instead of saying something comforting, I quickly looked away and left. I wish I hadn't, because I know exactly how that girl feels and, from personal experience, it's always better to have a shoulder to cry on (even if it's the shoulder of a stranger) than to cry by yourself, which is what I'm stuck doing right now.
