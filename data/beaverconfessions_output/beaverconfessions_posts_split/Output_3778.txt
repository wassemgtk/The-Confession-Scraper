People are constantly pushing against Trump, but nobody is talking about how much worse Cruz is. He runs purely on a flawed, extreme ideology and plans on shutting down anything that deviates from that (to quote, "I will repeal every word of [insert policy passed by a liberal]", "I will strike down every executive order passed by President Obama"). This is the man who shut down the government (leaving millions suspended from their jobs), the man who wants to implement a 15% flat tax on ALL American (which would triple our deficit and severely hurt poor Americans), the man who wants to abolish the Department of Energy,  and if he could, would proudly implement the Christian version of Sharia Law.
Please, if you're an "Anyone but Trump" Republican, look at Kasich or Rubio. Or a Democrat.
