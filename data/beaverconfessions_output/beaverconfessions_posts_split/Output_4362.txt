It's so stupid that people actually devote real time to thinking about dumb pointless shit like black lives matter or all lives matter or Trump or Bernie or whatever. We're at MIT, go and do some experiments in a lab and change humanity forever with science. None of this crap affects the vast majority of people in the world, and you're not going to be thinking about it at all in a decade or so. Stop living with the tunnel vision of your own insignificant, short lives, stop whining (which actually does all of nothing) and start thinking about how you can contribute as much to science as you can. The only thing that's going to matter when the sun explodes is whether or not we've colonized another galaxy.
