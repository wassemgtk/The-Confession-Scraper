I feel so burned out. It would be nice to think that this week is hell week and then it'll get better, but I know that besides all the tests and impossible psets due this week, I still have a mound of work waiting for me that I've been putting off because I was trying to study for this week. I don't have time to do things I love to do, things that make me who I am, anymore. It makes me wonder why I'm going through all of this. The worst part is, I don't have a great social life either. I have people I say "hi" to, but barely anyone who I can have a real conversation with about my concerns and hopes and fears. What am I doin wrong?
