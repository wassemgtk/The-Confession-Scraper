As a person of color, I am deeply concerned that MIT did nothing regarding the swastika in Senior House other than paint over it. Was it someone drunk who did it? Maybe. That doesn't change the severity of the situation.  A hate crime is a hate crime, and MIT's urgency to "sweep everything under the rug" is very alarming.
