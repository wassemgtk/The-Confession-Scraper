To all the people complaining about white privilege:

Listen, white or not white, we all have struggles. And I know you feel hated on because everyone says you get special treatment and all minorities are oppressed because of it, and they're totally milking it and blah blah blah.
But just imagine--with all the hardships that EVERYONE has to go through, it would be nice for people of color to not get judged simply for being of color. To not be doubted on a daily basis about their intellectual ability because "they're only here because of affirmative action." It would be nice to not get looked at funny when you go to a store and are followed around by (usually white) employees because not being white apparently makes you a shoplifter. It'd be nice to walk down a street without people clutching their purses or children closer, or CROSSING THE FUCKING STREET because they're scared to pass you because you're not white so you MUST be a criminal. It would be nice to not have to worry about your parents being discriminated against and not realizing it because you're not there to understand when someone throws racial slurs at them and since they don't understand because English just happens to be a bitchy language to learn, all they can do is smile and greet them. Or to be worried that you're not there to translate your younger siblings' school papers to them so they don't always know what's going on. Is it really too much to ask to be treated fairly? I mean, look at what society is calling people of color. MINORITIES. They are automatically labeled as something INFERIOR. 
So please. If you're gonna go complaining because you're always seen as just another good citizen while people of color are constantly being accused of being criminals of the world for not having been born white, or because on top of all your other problems you AT LEAST have to deal with people seeing you as THE MINORITY--go do it with other privileged human beings and stop asking the people that are currently on the short end of the stick to feel sorry for you. And if you're trolling, go make yourself useful and do something nice for people for a change. The world is fucked up enough without you making people's lives even more annoying to deal with.

P.S. Also, FYI, that's only SOME of the shit a Latina has to go through. So fuck off.

P.S.S. Can we please all stop being racist now and go back to posting confessions about having sex in random places and stuff? MIT is bitchy enough without this bullshit and I like seeing how creative people can be (you know, regardless of their race).
