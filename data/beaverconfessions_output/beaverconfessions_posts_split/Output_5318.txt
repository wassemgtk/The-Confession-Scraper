I saw on a visit home in the town square there was a Christmas tree and scene of the birth of Christ, and a Jewish menorah. This is unwelcoming to me as an atheist. I immediately went to the mayor to demand it be taken down at once. I was told it was put up by the local church, and it was legal, and it wasn't hurting anyone, and anyone was free to put up a figure celebrating any December holiday. That's not the point! The point is that this is creating a hostile environment for non believers such as myself. Does anyone know a way I can make them take it down? I'm tired of being discriminated against.
