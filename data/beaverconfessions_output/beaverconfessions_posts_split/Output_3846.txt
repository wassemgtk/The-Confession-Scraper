Course 8 undergrads here give physics such a bad rep. They're all shallow, full of themselves, undergroomed, and make you feel like shit for asking about something "trivial", yet every conversation I've ever overheard in the PCR has been so meaningless and so superficially theoretic that it didn't even *mean* anything. Just shut the fuck up guys and just find your place. Hint: no one does just physics anymore. If you're going to stick with it, do something else with your life too and stop bragging about how "smart" you are for regurgitating some equations we've all seen.
