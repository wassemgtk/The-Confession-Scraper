I got a peer review back from GEL and one of my teammates said they couldn't trust me because of my absences. It was anonymous, so I can't say anything to him or her directly. So, on the off chance my former teammate follows this page: Last semester, I developed a painful medical condition that made it physically impossible to get to class sometimes. It hurt like hell. That's why I had spontaneous absences. I didn't mean to let our team down. I never wanted to. And I'm sorry.
