In one of my classes, I've averaged about 1.5 standard deviations below the mean for all my exams. In another class, I'm pretty sure it was even worse (haven't seen my final exam grade yet). I study crazy hard, truly love the material (every lecture I feel blessed to be here), and feel like I have an equivalent understanding to most classmates I work with. I've been evaluated and did not receive a recommendation for extra time. I don't know what to do. How do you cope with objectively being in the bottom 10% of the class? I feel like I don't deserve to be here.
