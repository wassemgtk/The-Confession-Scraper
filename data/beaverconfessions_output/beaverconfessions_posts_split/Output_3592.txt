All of you who say that I've got my life together, pls.

We're all going to have fantastic jobs/go to fantastic schools coming out of this. Don't say that you envy me or wish you were like me -- I guarantee that you don't want the baggage I'm carrying.

So, stop. Just get to your own life. You'll do just fine.
