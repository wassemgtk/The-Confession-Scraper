I think that if I hadn't come to MIT when I did, I would be dead in the ground by now. Looking back on who I was before, I was not truly happy. At all. All I did was please people and cater to who people around me wanted to be, especially when they had to loudly put me down just to get me to act a certain way. Today, I love myself and do what I want. And I'm never letting anyone attempt to make me feel differently.
