I feel like MIT is mostly about self-teaching. At least for Course 6. Non of my classes really taught me anything properly in all 4 years. They assume we know things and lectures are like as if we are reviewing the stuff we already know. Recitations are never helpful either. It's almost purely our studying hard and learning by ourselves. Of course this doesn't apply to people who already know everything anyways(!) In such a "great" school, I would expect a better teaching strategy / performance..
