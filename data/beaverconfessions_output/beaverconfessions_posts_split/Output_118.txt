Help. What do you do, when you have a midterm/pset/obligation breathing down on your neck, and you don't have motivation to do anything?
I'm feeling very apathetic and depressed.  How do you guys keep on track? I exercise regularly, eat square meals, but I'm finding it harder and harder to motivate myself anymore.
