I'm a social parasite. Whenever I make friends, I end up assimilating everything I respected them for, and mildly disliking them once I feel like I "know" them. Then I move on and make new connections that intrigue and escape me that I couldn't have made before, only to be disappointed by them too.
I don't do this on purpose, and I don't try to hurt anyone, but it just kind of happens with all my friends, partners, and even communities, and I'm really tired of it all. 

Just for once I want to meet someone who isn't just socially static, who would push me to be a better person and also keep up with it.
