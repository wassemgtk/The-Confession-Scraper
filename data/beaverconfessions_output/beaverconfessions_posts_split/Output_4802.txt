If America is to work for us, how well will it work out when those placed in a higher tax bracket realize it's not worth working so hard anymore due to having pay for "free school", medical, and other so called benefits that hard working Americans are taxed for. It's only a matter of time until this country is run further into the ground. Nothing is for free, there are no breaks in life. Those who work insane amount of hours to achieve only the best possible outcome and accept nothing worse than very well know how it is. Capitalism is the reason Facebook is here, the reason you have smartphones, and food on your table. Don't like it? Leave the country. "The only problem with socialism, is eventually you run out of other people's money." - Margaret Thatcher
