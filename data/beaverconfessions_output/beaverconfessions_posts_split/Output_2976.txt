I’m standing on a ledge.

People say, don’t jump. People say, think of your family. Your friends. How they will cry. The police knock on your parents’ door, and the hysterical tears that will follow. The weeks and months of therapy and grief counseling. How they will pick up the phone to call me, only to realize I’m gone. How, when I’m gone, they will miss me. 

But I don’t get it. I’m gone now. I am on this ledge. No one is missing me. 

I told myself it was in my head. I told myself that they do care. But I stayed in my room for a week, and no one cared. I ate a bag of chips and a bag of almonds and drank water from my water bottle. I didn’t talk to anyone, I didn’t go to any class, I didn’t send any emails. I turned off my phone. 

No one sent me an email. No one sent me any messages. No one knocked on my door. No one, when I finally reappeared, asked where I was. 

People say, don’t jump. People say, they will miss you. Think of your friends. Think of what you have to live for. Think of your dreams that you still have. Think of the years you will be missing. 

What about my friends? The friends that don’t call. The friends that have seen the cuts on my arms and the bruises on my legs and who have seen me vomit up the pills and the alcohol, and who still don’t call. The friends that pulled me from the bed of a stranger the day after I was raped and who apologized because in their own drunken stupors, they had not guarded my drink. The friends that didn’t notice when I was dragged out of the party by a person I didn’t know. The friends that I desperately try to reach, but who are always busy. 

I get it. MIT is busy. And they tell themselves that this one time, they won’t pick up the phone and they won’t answer the message. This one time. But the problem with “this one time” is that this time I’m on the ledge looking down and there won’t be a next time. 

What dreams am I giving up? The dreams I will never see because I can’t get out of bed. The dreams that I will never reach because of the trauma and the depression and the diagnoses. Because the medication says I’m crazy, and no one wants to hire crazy. Because my parents say I’m wrong, because girls are always asking for it. Because I have therapists and medication and they say I’m getting better.

But I’m falling into a black hole, a gravitational singularity that has caught me and will not let go. To the observer, my fall will take forever. For me, only moments. 

I’m sitting on the ledge. I’ve clicked through all my contacts. Sent texts. Came up with the courage to call. Asking someone, anyone, to reply. I know you saw it. The blessing and the curse of read receipts. But it’s 2 AM and you are putting it off. Just this one time.
