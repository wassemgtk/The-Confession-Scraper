@5263 Your post doesn't go far enough. EC and Senior House are absolute cesspools of poor mental health. Their culture is toxic and causes even good people to succumb to groupthink and tribalism. People in these dorms think that they are invincible and to a higher degree buy into the bullshit "hardcore" mentality of doing as much as possible, enjoying life as little as possible, and projecting insecurity by bragging about how much you do. The cats are not taken care of and smell like absolute ass (as well as some of the residents). Fuck EC and Senior House.
