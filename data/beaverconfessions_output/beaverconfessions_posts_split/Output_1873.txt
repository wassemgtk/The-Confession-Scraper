I know every department has its quirks, but I have to say the course 10 department has a special place in my heart for treating its undergrad students like complete garbage. I know we're not producing research like the grad students but my goodness..we exist and are human beings too. 

example 1: department holiday party annually scheduled at the most inconvenient, impossible, and stressful time for undergrad students (the one day we have to study for finals)

example 2: department cookouts scheduled in early August when the majority of undergrads have not returned to campus. 

example 3: minimal licensing options for undergrads whereas grad students get access to the server filled with any program you can think of. All us undergrads get is a computer lab filled with not enough computers for students in one class/enough computers that work/enough computers that actually have the needed software downloaded/enough computers that have internet connection.

example 4: the notorious credit system where ICE modules are worth 4 and 8 units, 10.32 is worth 6 units, 10.37 is worth 9 units. In reality, all of us course 10s know this is complete bullshit for a representation of the number of hours. I know this is the same thing for many other departments as well. At least grad classes are worth 12 minimum. 

example 5: the most disrespectful professors I have met at MIT that make students cry, bully them, and cannot for the life of them teach/mentor well. There are exceptions, however they are few. I am not sure if these same professors treat their grad students like shit as well.
