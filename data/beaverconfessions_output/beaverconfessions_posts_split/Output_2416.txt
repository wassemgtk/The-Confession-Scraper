Scared to call out my entire FSILG to their face but it really shouldn’t be possible for people to be forced to move into a house if they don’t want to.  I get the monetary aspect of needing to ‘fill the house’ but monetary concerns like that should never come ahead of the well-being of the members (can’t we find some other money source??). Luckily I’m probably not going to be forced to move into the house, so I guess this doesn’t directly affect me, but if I was forced I would probably have to make the tough decision to de-affiliate because I don’t want to leave my current living situation and clearly the organization isn’t putting my happiness first. I hope this serves as a wake-up call for people to realize that what should matter the most, especially above money or simply wanting to fill the house, is the well-being of the members.
