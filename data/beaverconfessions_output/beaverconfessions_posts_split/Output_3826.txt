I'm starting to doubt my humanity.  I can't remember a time I've felt romantic feelings toward another person, and my sexual feelings vary from day to day.  It's been a while since I've felt like I've gotten anything out of human interaction, when I talk to other people I just feel nothing.  It's not that I'm super awkward - most people who know me probably thing in fairly normal.  I just feel like a robot sometimes.  I don't want to be this way, and I've tried to change things and make an effort to socialize more, but when I go back to my room at the end of the night I just feel as empty as ever.  Maybe I haven't tried hard enough or put myself out there enough, but I'm starting to lose faith in my ability to experience human connections and lose hope of ever being normal.
