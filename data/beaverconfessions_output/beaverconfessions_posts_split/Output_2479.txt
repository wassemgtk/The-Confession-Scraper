are you FUCKING kidding me right now MIT???? It is 9am on a FUCKING saturday morning, and there's construction going on outside senior haus and ec??? what the actual fuck. do you fuckheads know how important sleep is to us, how we use saturday and sunday to recover from the week, how important sleep is to our mental health and stability. maybe instead of doing really stupid things to improve our community that never work, you would actually make an effort to make students healthier.
