To the girl who tried to violently force her way into private areas at our party on Saturday: you're an absolute disgrace. I don't know if you're aware but racism, misogyny and sexual assault are real problems that destroy lives. People preventing you from going into their private residence is not racism or sexism. People standing in your way as you try and punch your way past them is not sexual assault. Throwing a tantrum when you don't get your own way is pathetic - dragging the entire fight for justice for victims of these crimes into the dirt with you is despicable. You're an embarrassment.
