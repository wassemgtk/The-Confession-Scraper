Happy birthday Israel? What the fuck?
Israeli independence day? Camel? HUMMUS?

THOSE ARE MY PEOPLE'S FUCKING CAMELS AND HUMMUS.

If we could get a Palestinian independence day that would be really nice.

I wonder what's preventing that from happening....

Wait- Israel's too busy enjoying their power and freedom.

How the fuck does the UA justify sponsoring this shit.
Can we get independence day parties for all the other countries represented at this institution too? Or are we going to just keep sucking the dicks of history's most oppressive "victims".
