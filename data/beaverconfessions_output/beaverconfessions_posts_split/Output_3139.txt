I suspect I have a mild form of ADHD. It is impossible for me to focus on a person speaking or on a reading for more than a few minutes without my mind wandering, even if I find the subject interesting. I've thought about talking about it with Mental Health, though as a second semester senior I guess I don't see the point anymore.
