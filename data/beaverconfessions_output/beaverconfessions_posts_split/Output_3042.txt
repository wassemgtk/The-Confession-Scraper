I remember in high school, when they told us that 1 in 3 women were sexually assaulted in their lifetime. I was with two friends of mine (girls) and I couldn't help but think: one of us is going to sexually assaulted. The whole day, I looked at groups of girls and thinking of the statistic. But I knew I couldn't get sexually assaulted. I was going to be responsible. Going to be in control of myself. My education on the matter was going to break the statistic. Then, I was sexually assaulted 2 months into my freshman year this year. I don't know what the point of this confession is. I haven't told anyone about my assault, so maybe it's me selfishly and cowardishly acknowledging what happened? I don't know. I don't know. But like 6 months later, it still sucks.
