I like this guy but he is in a long distance relationship so it's really easy to not remember but then we're psetting together, and hanging out together, and then he gets a skype call and I'm reminded so hard how much he likes her and then my heart clenches a bit and I know this is dumb, and it's probably proximity, and hopefully IAP will save me when he's not around.
