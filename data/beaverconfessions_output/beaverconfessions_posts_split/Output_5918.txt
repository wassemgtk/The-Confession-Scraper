I feel like MIT will only be really good at churning out worker bees. They give so much difficult work here that its hard to give a fuck about anything else, so only those mega smart kids actually end up thriving here. But still, idk. I feel like this approach wastes so much potential. So many bright, passionate kids come in only to get burnt the fuck out by the system.
