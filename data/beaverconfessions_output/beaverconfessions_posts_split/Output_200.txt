I was only asking if I could join your work group, so that I could have people to work with for a change. Not so that you could hold my hand through the pset, copy your answers/code, or whatever it was you were thinking I was implicitly asking. Get off your high horse. I've managed just fine the last few years on my own, and I'll continue doing so.
