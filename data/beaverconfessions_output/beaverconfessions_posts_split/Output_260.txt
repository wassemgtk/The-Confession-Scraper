Dear Frosh 

I am here to give u a little titbit on PNR.  This is a once in a lifetime opportunity to sleep, socialize and study at the same time. You must have some of the following before the end of Sem:
1. Fucked someone. I dont care if they are from Harvard. Fuck them.
2.Done more than three illegal activities. I'd use the Mind and Heart book for this one.
3. Missed a lecture. One advantage - you wil might meet another cool kid that also misses lectures. 
4. Told a prof that you hate their class. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity. You don't need As yet so just fuck their day up.
5. Lastly, if you fall in love with someone (and please don't during PNR) just fucking tell them. Don't wait for next term. This is pass no record. No record of this shit will exist after rejection.
 
Sincerely 

The praetor
