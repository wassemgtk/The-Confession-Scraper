Dear MIT:

PLEASE PLEASE. BETTER RESTAURANTS AT STUDENT CENTER!!!!!!

MIT board members need to dine at every restaurant in Student Center and realize that we students are literally eating oily, stale, salty trash food, and then they should head over to Boston University Student Center and compare how BU students eat normal food with variety. It sounds like a small deal, BUT IT ISN'T. When students have lots of work to do and need to grab a quick eat on campus, do you know how DEPRESSING IT IS TO EAT STALE TERIYAKI CHICKEN DRIPPING WITH OIL???? Food is a major source of happiness for many of us, and we are eating trashy food. All of my friends I have talked to agrees with me on this. MIT says it cares about student mental health and created some programs that basically say "you can come talk to me..."; however, these programs focus on treating the symptoms rather than solving the problems because the overall quality of life for students remains low. I don't understand how MIT spends millions of dollars in building research labs but invests very little in improving student lives.
