To those of you who think "safe spaces" trump free expression - you do realize that there are already built-in limitations to free speech, right? Like not shouting fire in a crowded theater?  As long as the speech creates a clear and present danger, it isn't protected by free expression and can be silenced and punished.

But there's a catch - the expression in question actually has to present a clear and present danger.  And if you're the one claiming the speech endangers your safety, it's up to you to show a clear and present danger exists.  If you merely claim the speech threatens/offends you and demand it be silenced, you blur the line between speech that is dangerous and speech that is merely individually offensive, and you appoint yourself judge and jury in determining what expression is or isn't permitted.
