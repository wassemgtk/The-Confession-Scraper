I don't go out partying because I feel like I should be working, but then end up wasting time online, on MIT confessions, etc. and stress eating and end up full of self disgust...Then I feel bad for whining about my first world problems when I know I'm so blessed to be attending MIT. It's hard to do anything right here! 

Relatedly, any tips on binge/stress eating? It's getting bad this year :(
