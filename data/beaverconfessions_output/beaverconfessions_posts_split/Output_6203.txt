Having been here for a while, I feel as though MIT can be a pretty isolating place. Whether this manifests itself in the form of a small unchanging friend group or spending most hours alone, it seems fairly easy to fall out of touch with the MIT community at large. Maybe I'm out on a limb here, but it seems as though it's mostly through online avenues, like MIT confessions, and at the few class-wide events that some people, like me, are reminded of the fact that 4000+ other undergrads are going through the same experience, with its mix of highs and lows. A decent number of high schools where I am from used to have weekly assemblies of the student body. At the time, I took these for granted but in hindsight, it was nice and almost therapeutic to have a chance to talk to people whom I otherwise wouldn't have had an excuse to interact with. While it's college and I'm guessing people don't want to have "assemblies", it would be nice if there were more campus-wide events. Maybe a free food event in Lobby 10 every month open to all undergraduates? Maybe other people feel similarly and have better suggestions. I recognize that confessions is probably not the best place to propose something like this... yeah, sorry about that.
