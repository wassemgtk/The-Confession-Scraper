My girlfriend and I had been together since high school, and then in the same dorm at MIT. 

She broke up with me. But before breaking up, she slept with someone on her hall, who she's now dating. I feel so crushed. Other people knew about it before me. So you lost interest in me, but after so many years together, you couldn't just tell me first?
