Achilles was talking to the Tortoise about his woes with women.

Achilles: tfw no gf
Tortoise: Getting a gf is easy if you just B.E. yourself.
A: huh? what do the B and E stand for?
T: The E stands for "entirely" and the B stands for "B.E.", so the expression expands to, "B.E. entirely yourself", which can further be expanded to, "B.E. entirely, entirely yourself.", and so on ad infinitum.
A: that doesn't make any sense. no matter how far i expand that expression i will never arrive at anything that has any meaning!
T: Today's exchange may have served a little to right your course.

The next day, Achilles returned to the Tortoise.

Achilles: i'm sick of trying to court 3D women, maybe I should get a 2D waifu.
Tortoise: Why not a waifu that's approximately 1.585D?
A: huh? how can something be 1.585D?
T: Consider the Sierpinski triangle. Doubling one side of this particular object results in three copies of itself, giving you: 2^d=3 where d is the number dimensions. Solving for d gives approximately 1.585...
A: STFU! i'm trying to have a serious conversation about my romantic frustrations and yet you continue to torture me with your mathematical tomfoolery!
T: Maybe the Koch Curve will whett your appetite...
