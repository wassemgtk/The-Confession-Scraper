I have a new term for everyone. It's adopted from GA Tech. TBS. aka Tech Bitch Syndrome, where girls who weren't all that great in highschool  all of a sudden realize that they're better looking than the majority of the girls at a tech school and end up thinking that they're hot shit.

You're Welcome
