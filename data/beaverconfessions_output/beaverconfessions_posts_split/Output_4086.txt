I moved to US with my family a couple of years ago. At MIT my best friends are international students - I love them, their open-mindness and their prospectives that are different or more open from mainstream American. Their friendliness and their acceptance. They are not as picky on people and they don't complain about simple insignificant things that irritate them daily - because their living conditions were a lot worse growing up in 3rd World countries, just like my own childhood.

The only worry is that most of them will not stay in US after college and it will be hard to maintain the friendship, but I value our time together nonetheless. Shout out to international students!
