I'm in love with Joe Steinmeyer. How does he have time and energy to be so smart, nice/helpful, up on his cultural references and look like he stepped off a hipster fashion blog?
Too bad he mentions his gf in class. If that goes south, need to be around to swoop in..hehehe...
But why is his office in the most inconvenient location to convincingly "casually totally not on purpose" run into him on a regular basis?

Tl;dr hot lecturers should have easier to stalk office  locations. It'll be good for campus mental health.
