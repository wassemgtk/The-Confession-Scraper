I also have always had this feeling that I'm not going to live a very long life. I've never been able to imagine myself living past 40, tbqh. But I've never made actual plans to kill myself. I find a lot of comfort in the inevitability of death. Even if I do nothing at all, I'll die eventually. Regardless of what (if anything) comes afterwards, it's really something that I look forward to.  
I know I'm going to die early, but I felt like it would happen by natural causes, or at least, causes out of my control. Like, I'd be randomly hit by a car, or caught in the middle of some tragic accident, or have a sudden heart attack, or die in my sleep from some unknown disease. Regardless of how bad life got I could rest assured that it would end eventually, and much sooner than for most people. At some point in highschool, I decided to make ~37-40 my limit. If by some freak chance I managed to still be alive at 40 years old, I'd go ahead and let myself kill myself, as selfish as that is.
But lately, it seems like the best decision that I could make for myself would be to end it all now. Not /right/ now, but maybe sometime before the start of next semester. Don't worry, I haven't made any plans yet. I'm trying to figure out how to create buffers for my friends and family. They're why I'm so hesitant to go this route, tbh. There's no way to completely shield them from the pain-- the confusion, the guilt-- my death will cause them. It's not their fault. Heck, it's not even MIT's fault. I don't have any anger right now for anyone (except maybe myself). This semester (sophomore) has been hard. It started out badly and only got progressively worse. I can imagine that things might have gone better had I picked different classes, or if I was someone better at talking about their feelings. Something about this specific combination of personality and circumstance created the perfect catalyst for the most depressive period of my life.
I can (also) usually find solace in the fact that, no matter how bad things get, they always eventually get better. I can't see that happening anymore. I can barely even imagine what it was like to think like that (and that was just a few months ago!). 
I don't want to be a burden to anyone; i doubt they could help anyway. I don't want to increase the number of people who might take my death personally. Maybe if I kept my head above the water for long enough, I'd find a way to pull myself out again. But I doubt it. Time isn't really on my side. and I prefer being at MIT, on campus, to being at home.
I know posts like these are always kind of a downer. I'm sorry for adding more darkness to the impending finals week. I just, felt like I need to write this now.
