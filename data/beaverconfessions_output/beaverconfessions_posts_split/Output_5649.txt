My neighbor at home is a baker who happens to be gay.  Recently he had a customer who was looking to get a wedding cake, but when he found out my neighbor was gay he left and got a cake elsewhere.  This customer refused to be served by someone on account of his sexual orientation, an act of blatant discrimination! 

This customer needs to be taught a lesson!  There ought to be a law preventing this kind of bigotry.  You know, how Sweetcakes by Melissa got fined $135,000 for not serving a gay couple? Yeah, that's what this guy should get too!
