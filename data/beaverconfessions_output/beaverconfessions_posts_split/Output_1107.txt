Whenever I tell people I'm Course 7, everyone asks if I'm pre-med. It is something I might be thinking about, but I just really love biology, and want to learn as much about as I can. I would prefer it if people asked something like "What do you want to do in the future?" instead of assuming I wanted to be a doctor. I definitely don't have anything against pre-meds or doctors -- many are wonderful people -- but there's other things you can do with a biology degree!
