I think its important for people at MIT to realize that while things at MIT are difficult and all of us feel like a complete loser for a large fraction of our time here, the bigger picture is much brighter. Firstly, a Prof at MIT said that if you're at MIT, you must be doing something right. Also, if we step out of MIT, we can clearly see how much better our education here is compared to other schools. I know, coz I'm a grad student who did undergrads elsewhere. 
One thought I really feel like sharing: if you keep failing at something,it doesn't mean you're a failure. It just means that you're supposed to succeed at something else. A lot of us are bad at accepting failure. For example, not matter how much Stephen Hawking may want to be an athlete, the truth is he has to accept that he can't be and cherish his talent in Science.
