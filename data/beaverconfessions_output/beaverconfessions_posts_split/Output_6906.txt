A woman was lifting a table in the architecture department. Trying to fulfill his societal role, a male came up to her and offered to lift the table for her. She turned him down.

I mean it's very nice of you that you're offering. But if you're only doing it just because she's female, you're reinforcing this idea that women are incapable of doing physical things like lifting a table.
