5478 If you want to, jump. I'm going to tell you to jump. I don't know your life. I don't care about you. And you know what, that's okay by me. 

I'm in the same place. But I don't jump because somewhere down there I want to feel better, I want to feel like not jumping. You have to hold yourself back, because no one else will. Even now, fuck your family/friends, you're still the only one holding yourself back.
