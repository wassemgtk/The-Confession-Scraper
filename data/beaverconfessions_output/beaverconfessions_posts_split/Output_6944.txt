What's with all these creepy missing person flyers up and down the infinite and dorm row?  What happened in Mexico sucks, but there's absolutely nothing I can do about it.  It's not like I can go looking for them around the MIT campus.  Whenever I see one of those posters it just makes me feel awful for those people and their families, and awful because I can't help the problem.
