I haven't shown up to my UROP in weeks because I'm terrified of talking to anyone there and facing their disappointment at my failures.  It just took me over an hour to remember how to do dumb stuff with logarithms and algebra.  I can't focus of my own will anymore.  I'm on too many medications and want to quit them, but I'm afraid that then I'll actually lift my legs all the way off the ground when I lean over high railings.  And I'm a hopelessly selfish and shitty girlfriend.
