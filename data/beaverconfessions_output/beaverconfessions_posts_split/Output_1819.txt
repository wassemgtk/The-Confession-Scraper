Very often when I am out and about and I see a woman, I will instinctively objectify her and think of her sexually. I hate that I do this, as it feels like I am reducing her to a sexual object when she is literally just minding her own business walking down the street. However, I have trouble countering this instinct unless I deliberately fix my eyes away from a woman I find attractive. I find this strange because my personal relationships with women, both platonic and romantic, have been otherwise healthy.

Does anyone else have this problem and have tips for a sort of mental calibration so that this will not be my default?
