I truly wish I had never met you. I am now trying to forget the last 4 years of my life, and this is not something one can leave behind on a whim. 

You know how they say if you want to forget something, you should get rid of everything that reminds you of that experience? I walked around my room, looked into my closet, looked through my books, and realized I would have to burn pretty much everything I own..

And one would doubt that there was nothing good in those past 4 years, but honestly, if I were erase them from my life, I would not feel at loss at all. If I had a chance to turn back time, I would, just to change those 4 years. And I am not saying this merely because I'm in pain. I am saying this because it wasn't a learning experience either: there was nothing I learned from this, or at least nothing that could ever be worth so much of my emotional and even physical health, energy, and time.
