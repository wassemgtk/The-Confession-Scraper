Sometimes, as I walk past that statue, I would think about all the times we spent just sitting there. We would talk. Hours upon hours. I would gaze into your eyes, wishing that I could bring myself to finally say the three words that I wanted to say for a long time.
 “I love you.”
 But then, I would wake up. I would then remember that it has been a year since we’ve last spoken. Time has a way of twisting memories into moments that appear so vividly close and heartbreakingly distant. It wasn’t too long ago when I would bring food for us to share in the library and tease you about your silly mannerisms. The way you would quirkily put your pen over your lips, pretending it was a mustache. The way you would gently punch my arm as you pretended to be offended whenever I jokingly mimicked your mannerisms. The way you would ask the people sitting nearby to take photos of us as we made the most ridiculous faces.
