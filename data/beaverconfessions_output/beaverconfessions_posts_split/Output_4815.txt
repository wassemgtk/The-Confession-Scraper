The new GEL posters are rather classless. 

"Work *with* Harvard people, not *for* them"? Really? Is it necessary to put down MIT's education and entire student body for not having the supposed "leadership" skills all Harvard students have? Why don't they focus on some statistics of the good the GEL program does instead? They're driving students away from a program that I'm sure helps many students.
