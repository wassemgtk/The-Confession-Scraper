How do you talk to people? Seriously, my social skills are so poor it is taking a constant toll on my confidence. 
First of all, I am an international student who grew up in a vastly different culture from most of the students here. It's literally two opposite corners of the globe, so it is always hard to relate to people based on some key elements from this culture. 
Secondly, I find it hard to keep a conversation going most of the times. It feels like people doesn't care what I'm passionate about/I don't care what the people I'm meeting are passionate about. This might also be a big reason why I de so antisocial, but how can I break out of this circle? 
Finally, due to spending most of my high school life after some very special extracurricular activity, I am mote used to being in a clique than being in a friend circle that's more of a sparse graph. But it takes time to build a clique anywhere and in the meantime I am feeling awkward and lonely. Any suggestions?
