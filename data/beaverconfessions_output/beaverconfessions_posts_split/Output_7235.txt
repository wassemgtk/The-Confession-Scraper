That moment when you're finally learning about the *infamous* gameshow problem in your second semester of freshman year at MIT, and you realize that the kid in the movie 21 was a first semester senior when he was asked about this problem and got it right. No way that would have caught the professor's attention. I call BS on that whole movie.
