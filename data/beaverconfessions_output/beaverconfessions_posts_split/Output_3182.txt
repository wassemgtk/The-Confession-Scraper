several people at my dorm have been literally so fucking racist towards me.  one of my friends literally said TO MY FACE "white people suck", dead serious.  this kind of shit happens quite often.  do you fucking realize that you just insulted me and my entire family? fuck you and your generalizations, assuming you know the first thing about me based ONLY on the color of my skin.  you don't know anything about my background or my family.  NO RACISM IS ACCEPTABLE.  THIS GOES FOR ANY RACE.  there is no justification for treating people this way. NO BUTS.
