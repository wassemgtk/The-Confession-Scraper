Scott, I really have to get this off my chest. Ever since I've met you I just felt a particular way about you, some way that I couldn't describe... until now. I have crafted these words specifically for you and only you, so that I can convey my desire:

You are a truly singular person, and although now you experience this through pain, someday that very same pain will be useful to you, because anything or anyone worth their space, was forged through adversity.

Your Friend,

Perez
