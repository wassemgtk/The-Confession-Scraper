I started up a pseudo relationship with a another girl while I was with my long time girlfriend. My girlfriend eventually found out and I stopped talking to the girl. But I can't stop thinking about her even though it's been almost a year since we last talked. I miss her and keep thinking that she's the one I'm supposed to be with, and that I've made a huge mistake. I just wish I knew if she felt the same way about me as I felt about her. I loved her with all my heart, but I'm afraid the love was one sided. I know she cared for me, but if I knew she loved me then maybe I can find the courage to follow my heart
