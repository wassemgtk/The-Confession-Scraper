I don't feel like I'm doing anything *real*. I'm feel like I'm always either doing academic stuff, career stuff, or losing my time on the internet. I don't have any hobbies. I hang out with people sometime but I don't think I have any friends. 

Am I doing something wrong? Am I missing out on something?
