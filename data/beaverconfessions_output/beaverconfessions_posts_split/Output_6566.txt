Does anyone else notice how the average attractiveness of the female population at MIT skyrockets during the spring? Smart girls in sundresses and shorts... oh my. Now I'm not saying that if cargo shorts and plain T-shirts are your thing you need to change, but girls, if you want to turn some heads, just know that putting a little effort into your outfit goes a long way.
