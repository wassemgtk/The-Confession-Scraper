i'm a senior graduating in June with a variety of mental health problems that are preventing me from being able to handle school and job searching at the same time. almost everyone at MIT seems to graduate with either a job offer or a grad school acceptance, but i'm terrified that i'll graduate with nothing. are there stories of people who graduate without definite plans? i just want to be able to support myself........
