A while ago I found out that black people take names from other groups and add a prefix, forming names such as "DaJuan" and "D'Ron". At first I was like "DaFuq?" but then I decided it was actually kind of neat, creating their own identity while relating to the existing (white) American and Hispanic cultures.
