Sometimes I catch myself dominating a conversation and realize I never asked back "how are YOU?" I feel bad, but I think this is also my way of letting people know that I have genuine interest in talking to them and they should feel comfortable going beyond "I'm good, thanks". Maybe I go a bit too far though.
