Being in the closet, TAing, and having strong feelings for one of your student is not the best thing in life right now ... it also doesn't help that I feel like I'm getting physical cues from him ... lots of them.  Plus, I'm failing or doing average in most of my classes in my major and really rethinking my major right now. AHHHHH I didn't ask for my life to get this complicated (very big sigh)
