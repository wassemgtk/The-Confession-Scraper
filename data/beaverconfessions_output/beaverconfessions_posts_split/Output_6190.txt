Heres what pisses me off the most about MIT. The education here is not much better than at other places. In some cases, the classes here are shit. In just about all of my classes, I've been learning off lecture notes from random universities, some of which don't even make USNews ranking top 100. The biggest difference is that at other universities you don't get shat on with work that assumes near perfect understanding of lectures.
