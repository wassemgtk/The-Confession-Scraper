"Perhaps I didn't stop to share -
You'd speak, and I'd respond.
It's not as though I didn't care -
I didn't break our bond.

I didn't change, or think to find
A finer friend than you -
I didn't hold you back, behind,
Or tell you what to do.

And when you came to make the call
To say you're moving on -
I didn't speak a word at all.

Perhaps that's why you're gone."
