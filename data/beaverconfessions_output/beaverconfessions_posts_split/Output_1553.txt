Why do people say that Bernie is the best shot at beating Trump? If (and when) Hillary gets the nomination, would Bernie supporters switch to Trump so that they can fight the establishment? That seems unlikely. Hillary is a moderate Democrat is Bernie is very leftist. It is my understanding that when taking on an extremely far off the spectrum candidate like Trump, most Americans gravitate towards the moderate one. If Bernie gets the nomination, the huge number of moderate Republicans that have been turned off by Trump will have a very hard time choosing between candidates. If Hillary gets the nomination, seems to be a much easier choice.
