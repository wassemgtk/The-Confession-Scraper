Is it weird that I'm 20 and have never been kissed/been in a relationship? I thought i would be able to get to know someone in college, but all of my closer friends have still always been girls. I've found it incredibly hard to bring it up to them, since most of them are in happy relationships - I'm happy for them, but it makes me feel even more like a freak. I don't think I'm ugly or anything - just shy and insecure. I am genuinely lost on how to even begin making more guy friends. It also seems like many people came into college with high school sweethearts and/or met people during their first semester/year, and I'm worried that I'll seem like even more of an anomaly. :(
