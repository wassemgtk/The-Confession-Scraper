In light of that other MIT Confession... I would actually like to take a moment to talk about just how unfit for his position Kevin Kraft is.

First, he blatantly lies to students, faculty and staff. He says one thing to you one day, then something else to someone else the next. He preaches about how much he is into 'ethics' and 'honesty', but he is one of the most political and devious members of the MIT community. Over my time at MIT, I could write a book with the litany of times he has done this (but I will not be specific here, elsewise it would be identifying, and he is kind of in charge of the Office of Student Citizenship and I KNOW he would be reactionary).

Second, he is never direct and upfront. He is always round-about, passive-aggressive and never to the point. Maybe this ties into that dishonesty bit above. It is so damn hard to hammer him down to one viewpoint on anything.

Third, he has a very narrow, moralistic (and hypocritical, in light of the above) way of seeing the world and is absolutely unwilling to change it, no matter what anyone else says or what the community needs. I would be fine with this if he was just any person, but for someone who actually helps make policy at MIT, and is involved in the future of student's lives, it is absolutely unacceptable for someone to not be open to new ideas or even question their own. ESPECIALLY AT MIT!!! Like what the hell?

Fourth, CAN HE SERIOUSLY STOP BEING SO TWO-FACED WITH THE FSILG COMMUNITY??? "Oh, yes, you can do that..." "Oh, nevermind, no you can't, and now you're in trouble..." "Oh, well, that's true for everyone else, but for YOU, no, no you can't do that..."

Fifth, I have NEVER MET SOMEONE who is LESS SELF-REFLECTIVE in my ENTIRE LIFE. If you were to ask Kevin about himself, or how effective he is in his job, or how effective the OSC is, according to him - everything is perfect! Everyone ELSE is wrong and messed up. These things you hear? Bad policies? Bad experiences? Simply fringe. We won't change. I'm perfect, everything I do is perfect, everyone else just needs to conform to MY standards. Talk about a lack of community-mindedness.

We need someone who runs the Office of Student Citizenship who lives up to the MIT values of honesty, integrity, and who looks out for the good of our community, not the good of their own self or world. That person is not Kevin Kraft.
