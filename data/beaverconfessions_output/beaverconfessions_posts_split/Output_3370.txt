Props to all of you that actually do work over Spring Break!

It kind of worries me, though. Remember that life isn't all about PSETS and GPAs. Remember to take a breath, relax, and enjoy the journey of life. 

There's no real need to plague piazza with "WHY ISNT THE PSET POSTED YET" over spring break because you NEED to relax. 
Learn to sit back and take in the scenery or else life will come and go without being able to enjoy it
