I have been an oozing puddle of stress for the better part of this year, and I often wondered if I was wrong for coming here and thinking I should go into STEM. But somehow now, right near the end, a lot of my classes have clicked with me and I've gotten really excited about science again. And it's a really fucking great feeling.
So hang in there for the next couple of weeks, everyone, and remember why we came here. You can make it.
