While we are talking about Ayida, thankfully my experience wasn't as terrible as a lot of yours, but basically I had a lot of issues last semester with family related shit and I was having panic attacks and I was super anxious and I just couldn't focus on any work, So I went to S^3 and saw Ray Feller and she was great and got the test waived and everything was fine and I was back to normal after a few weeks because like I've always had a shitty family life and im pretty used to it at this point. Then this semester I was having some issues that I wasn't as used to dealing with and I felt really dumb for letting issues that were so small comparatively to what Im used to dealing with affect me so much. I couldnt get out of bed, I was sleeping for 12+ hours a night and just sitting staring at blank psets for hours, I finally decided to go to S^3 when I weighed myself and I'd lost 15 lbs, and had realized I hadnt had anything but coffee in over a week. I went there in shitty PJ's and i hadnt showered in quite some time. I'm sitting in the waiting area waiting for James Collins (an angel) and Ayida comes out and proceeds to sit right next to me as Im almost in tears in the corner, She proceeds to tell me about how lucky I have it being here and how I'm only a freshman and if im already having issues this place is going to destroy me and that its just not for everyone. Sitting there I really regretted going to S^3 and honestly was contemplating asking for withdrawl because i was so depressed and I just didnt want to be around people. Luckily James came and got me from the waiting area said complete opposite and helped me actually get back on track and everything is still a little rough but Im doing a lot better now and went from failing to passing almost all of my classes.
