Sometimes I think I might be depressed but then I realize that it doesn't actually fit since I am happy sometimes, I just get sad about things that are really actually trivial. I sometimes wish that I were dead, but I could never actually kill myself since I'm too scared. I don't have actual depression and it's kind of terrible of me to consider myself depressed when some people actually are and it's really bad for them. I also don't want to go talk to anyone about it since I don't have actual problems and I don't want to be told that I should just get over the small problems that I get upset about, since I know that already. I know that I need to just suck it up and get over myself but I almost just don't want to feel better.
