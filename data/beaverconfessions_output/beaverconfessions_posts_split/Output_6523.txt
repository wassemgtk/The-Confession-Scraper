PSA: For those that are frustrated by the busy human highway that is the infinite corridor, fear not. There exists a parallel universe: a one where an identical infinite corridor is bestowed upon mankind; namely, in the basement and second and third levels. The wormholes to these multiverses are located conveniently on the two ends and along the entire corridor length. Use liberally to fast forward the unpleasant jungle of human beings on level one during rush hour.
