I really need more than 4 years to actually take advantage of MIT. And no, it's not because I haven't done all that I could to make my 4 years useful! Despite my efforts, there's so many good things to do here. I feel like I haven't soaked them all in, or soaked them all in enough or my maximum capacity. (I would not like to MEng though.)
