Idk, but the finals seems to make me turn... Mad. I constantly feel this anxious and worry feeling which is really suffocating me right now and it's still Friday noon. I can't help but to feel like crying any fucking second. I don't know how to settle down, should I get help frm the S^3 or something?? I feel so confused and lost, it's terrifying. I feel like I had failed my life. I donâ€™t deserve to be here. Am I the only one feeling like this?? I don't know anymore. Just... Please help me
