I always get so angry whenever I see people like Ben Carson on the news running as a Republican. He talks about pulling himself up by his own merit and how he thinks liberals are "playing the race card". Newsflash, we are trying to protect your rights and call out racism. He gets angriest at white liberals too. Hey Ben, if it weren't for white liberals like us, you would still be smiling at the white man by force drinking from colored water fountains, you owe us.
