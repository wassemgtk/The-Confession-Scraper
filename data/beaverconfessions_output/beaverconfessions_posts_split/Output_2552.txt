Really #5892? You're going to sit there and attack someone personally for something marginally offensive and then parade yourself as a leader who will run next year? I got news for you, leaders stand up and aren't afraid to put their face on issues. They also don't attack people to bring them down, but only to defend themselves. The disgraceful "#endofacareer" hashtag shows your true intentions and idk what you personally have against Trevor, but since you're too much of a coward to put your friggin name on the post you prevent anyone from realizing what this is really about. Trevor at worst made one mistake and apologized profusely, while staying calm during bullying (read: "#endofacareer" & "are you going to post this to your wall" (Tremaan Robbins, not OP) literally seconds after he initially posted it, before he could've even navigated to post it on his wall) and attacks at his personal character that had to have been absolutely tough for him. Along those lines, wtf Deven Lahoti, posting the pic does what exactly besides prevent us from moving past this and potentially triggering more people? That's the definition of incitement. Also, before anyone calls me a hypocrite for posting this anonymously I want to clarify I have no intention of getting into the fucked up world of politics and minor offenses, and also I am defending a clearly maliciously toned post, not going out of my way to attack facelessly. A final thought: We're all MIT students and this place really friggin sucks as is, so we can't hate and turn on each other. If someone messes up, call them out and make sure they don't do it again, but don't attack them, cause then you're unequivocally as bad or even worse (in this case since the instigator was a minor offhanded offense and the reply was a direct malicious attack, I'm going to classify it as worse) than the original issue.
