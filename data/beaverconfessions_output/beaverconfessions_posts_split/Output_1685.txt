Alright, so I came home from an exhausting exam and I was about 15 minutes into my crash when some fucker(s) at Next House decided to fuck up whatever the fuck they were fucking up to and caused a massive fire alarm, without a single fucking apology. This also happened another time I when I was in the middle of something that must not be interrupted, and I ended up flushing several hours worth of work and frustration down the drain. I learnt that however unlikely your life path is going to cross with some random fuck face, the chance they can fuck you over is nonzero. It doesn't fucking matter if it's a 5 minute or half an hour lockout, you owe at least some of us a fucking explanation. I know Next House residents are supposed to be nice and shit but it had to be said. It's fucking pathetic if you realize that you probably jizzed on half a thousand people's life and mood and decided to be a silent fucking fart. ~ An angry resident.
