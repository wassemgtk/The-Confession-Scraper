I am working through so much shit right now and I can't seem to leave my dorm for anything and every day is spent trying to keep myself sober but to no avail, as I light up and start my day. I withdraw from friends and family, I have not had more than 3 sober days in the past 4 months, at least. I try to reach out, to let my friends know I am trying, but they see I have fucked up again, blazed another day away, and I withdraw deeper into my thoughts, now a pit of self-loathing. Remembering every repressed thought, forced to face everything that made me the basket case I am, and now I don't know how to dig myself out or let them know I care for them deeply and can't afford to lose them in this time of inner turmoil
