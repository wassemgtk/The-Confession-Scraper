Has anyone before alerted MIT leadership about how awful the MIT shuttle and Saferide system is? I have been thinking of writing some type of letter/email/petition to ask administration to do something about our lousy transportation, and thought that this would be a great platform to start.  First of all, the coordination with the MIT app is completely unreliable, as the buses are never on time. Sometimes the closest bus just disappears altogether and doesn’t come back for an hour. How is this technology a hard thing for MIT(the best technical school in the world) to get right?
Also, the Boston Daytime shuttle in particular is absolutely inadequate at transporting the large amount of people who live in Boston. I’ve seen instances of people not fitting onto a bus when its 5 degrees outside, and then resort to walking across the freezing bridge to not be late for class.  
In contrast, the Harvard bus system is spectacular. It comes through Boston and Cambridge more frequently than MIT’s shuttle, and the app is spot on with times and always reliable.  I can’t imagine that it would be that hard or expensive for MIT to hire a few more drivers and buy a couple more buses. I love this school, but I believe that this is definitely a worthwhile issue that can be fixed.
