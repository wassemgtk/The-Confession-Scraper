Sometimes I wonder if MIT was a good fit for me. I'm pretty involved on campus politically and there are the few that get excited about making change. But a lot of times it feels like talking to an echo chamber.  A friend told me that MIT is apathetic because politics isn't something that really affects upper-middle class STEM professionals in a noticable way.  But we don't live in a vacuum as much as this page suggests.  I really want to believe that not as many people act apathetic because they really don't care but because they don't know how or why to care. If there are more opportunities to get involved and people understand how the system can create change in our lives then maybe people will also pay more attention.  Whether its funding research, better healthcare, better STEM education, more opportunities and jobs, or just being able to feel like you have a say in the system that structures your life, politics isn't this just a thing that loud overly opinionated people do. It's a way of engaging your community and making it better for everyone.  You can register to vote, help people register, get involved with MIT Democrats, Republicans, whatever you stand for, generally read news, learn about how things in Cambridge change and get changed, whatever it is you want to do to feel engaged.  It's a wonderful feeling and I wish I more people around me had it.
