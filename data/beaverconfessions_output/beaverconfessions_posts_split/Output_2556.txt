To the previous post about social awkwardness at MIT, I'm sorry you think we're such dorks to you. I for one was raised in a cold, overbearing household. I didn't make friends because my parents didn't trust my classmates. I was just weird and alone all the time, but I had good grades. That's all I knew until college. Thank goodness I have some friends here, but there are many people (especially girls) who judge me for not the well-connected, charismatic social butterfly of their dreams. Don't ask people to imply they should be someone else when you ask them to just bee themselves.
