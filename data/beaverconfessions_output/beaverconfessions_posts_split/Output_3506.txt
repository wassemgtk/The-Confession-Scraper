To those of you who will move to Canada if Trump becomes president, why is it never Mexico? Do you not value different cultures? Do you only want to go where the same language is spoken? 

You racist fucks how are you better than Trump? 

Show Mexico some real love don't just defend it because it's the target of a barrier to keep the political, social, and economic problems in that country out of ours.
