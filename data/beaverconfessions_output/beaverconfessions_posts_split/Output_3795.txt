This is a response to my last confession (which was a response to my first confession) about calling her "my girl".

This is exactly what I mean... We can no longer harmlessly play around about things as simple as girls being crazy or moody in 2016 bcs people are WAY TOO EMOTIONAL/SENSITIVE. If you're trying to tell me girls cannot be crazy or moody, you have definitely never met a female cuz even girls say that about themselves...
It's not even about being a stereotype. My intentions were to honor my girlfriend by being proud of her/showing her off despite her flaws (we all have flaws don't we?). It was in a loving-joking manner. 
A girl could say the same thing about a guy (calling her boyfriend crazy or dramatic). 
Also, regarding calling her "my girl" instead of "woman"??? Really?? Are we really going to be THAT sensitive and create this NONEXISTENT connotation of disrespect toward a girl because she wasn't referred to as a woman??? She IS a girl. It's a word to describe her sex. She is also a woman. We all recognize that. My choice of words connote a playful/lovable tone. Not one of machism. 

Gender equality is important. Females deserve to be respected in all situations. I support feminism. 

I really don't mean to offend anyone, but for the love of all things good in this world, y'all have to quit being so butt hurt. This is why our generation has the thinnest skin in all of history.
