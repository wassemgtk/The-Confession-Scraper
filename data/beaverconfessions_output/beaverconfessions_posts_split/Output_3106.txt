White students of MIT: How do you not feel ridiculous when you realize you've become such a guilt-laden apologist that you actually think europeans have a more violent history than other continents? Success does not equal violence. Look around at the world. Do you think it's coincidence that western nations are the only ones who have managed to get rid of slavery and make such great strides in civilization? Stop feeling guilty for descending from the most ambitious and successful people to have walked this earth and have some goddamn pride in your ancestors.
