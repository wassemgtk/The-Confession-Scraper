7.03 is the most poorly taught class I have ever taken so far. It is very unorganized, and poorly structured. On top of that, there are very few available resources to study, and the grading system is very obscure and ambiguous. The professors are amazing researchers (apparently), but they are not very understanding of the students. They need to reflect upon themselves, think about the days that they were once students, and put in SOME effort into making sure that students learn and firmly grasp the presented material so that they can one day ACTUALLY apply what they learn. I will not specify which of the professors said this, but when he said that a class average on an exam around 60 is "good", I could not believe he could have such philosophy. Every 7.03 exam this semester was somewhat unfairly written, in that some of the content of the exam was barely touched upon in lecture OR had material that we should have had more exposure to prior to being tested on it. I did not fail the class, if anyone is wondering why I'm ranting about 7.03. I did quite well, considering how the class is run, but I cannot believe this is the way that this class has been taught in the previous fall semesters. There definitely needs to be change if MIT wants its students to focus on learning the presented material, NOT freaking out about the obscurity of grades and having to clean up after the professors for their lack of organization and structure.
