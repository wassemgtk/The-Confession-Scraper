I find it troublesome that there is all this attention to fighting sexual assault.  Too often I hear reports of two people, who are both drunk, hooking up and then the girl suddenly proclaims to be the victim even though both parties gave their consent (even if under the influence).  Then the case becomes her word against his word and in our society now there is a presumption of guilt with the man. For example the Duke lacrosse scandal a couple years ago ruined several young men's lives even though it was later found that they were completely innocent, as the "victim" simply lied.  I believe that if found guilty the perpetrators should be punished severely and swiftly, but in a country based on a presumption of innocence, I think the overreaction to sexual assault accusations goes against this foundational American value.
