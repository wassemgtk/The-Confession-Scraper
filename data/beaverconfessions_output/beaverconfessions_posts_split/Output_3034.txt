I'm trying to write a math paper and running out of fucking letters in the alphabet. Its like if you want to have an integer, you can't use x, y, z cuz those are reserved for variables, u, v and w sound like goddamn vectors, I already used p, q, r, s, t,  and then o is just fucking weird. Trust me n and m were employed long ago, and i, j, k, and l are reserved for indices. If you venture int f, g, h land then it sounds like a function, and e is just e, which just leaves a, b, c, and d but please those are all used in section 4. Help!
