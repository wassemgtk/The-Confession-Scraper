My Ayida story: I saw Ayida once because my regular dean was out of town. I told her I was having interpersonal issues that were impeding my work, but she did not accept that. So I reluctantly told her I had recently been sexually assaulted, something I did not want to share since my other dean already knew. Yet she would not accept that. I was only offered assistance once I had detailed the entire assault. It was incredibly painful. I still communicate with my dean occasionally over email, but I have not set foot in S^3 since.
