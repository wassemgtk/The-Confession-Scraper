I feel like everything in my life is subpar. I enjoy all of it but there's nothing that I would not replace with something better. I really like my freinds but there are better ones, I like my girlfreind but I could find one prettier and more fun. I am excited about my job that I will be pursuing but it isn't my dream job. 

When I was younger, I thought I would always work and get want I wanted but now I feel as though life is just about settling for the best you can get.
