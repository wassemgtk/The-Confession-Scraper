I should have realized that acting cavalier about suicide was a symptom. Once it got to the point where I couldn't joke about it, I shut myself in my room and avoided nearly all social contact. Being isolatory and misanthropic was my only way to cope, but that isn't me. I just couldn't help it. 

Despite the fanfare made about mental health here, I've found almost no reprieve in my peers. Frankly, everyone avoids you when you start showing symptoms of being a loon. No 20ish year old is equipped to handle someone who is truly mentally ill, and neither are most therapists. It's folly to think otherwise. 

If you are in chronic, acute, unmanageable pain, get away from MIT before you hurt yourself. Dr. Lejeune at mental health and Dean Mthembu at S3 may be able to help. Recognize coping mechanisms (addictions, abnormal cognitive patterns, outbursts) for what they are, and seek change that doesn't involve heights or sharp objects. Best of luck to you, and enjoy the break.
