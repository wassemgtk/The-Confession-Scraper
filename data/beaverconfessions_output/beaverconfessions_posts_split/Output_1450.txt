Dear Whoever Picked the Outfits for Recruitment,

You're requests are ridiculous, obnoxious, and expensive. Who the fuck is going to wear some of this shit besides the one day during Recruitment? And nice job 

I just want you guys to know that shit like this is why girls don't join sororities.

Sincerely,
One of your sisters
