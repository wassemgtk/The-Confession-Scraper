What do I do if I am actually too dumb to take 'real' courses here at MIT. My high school didn't have nearly enough math or science classes and I never really learned the fundamentals of mathematics. Literally the other day during a test I had to see if it was possible to split a square root. I got a B- in 18.02, and can apply 'higher' level concepts (as if 18.02 were high level concepts) to problems but lack the strong foundation. It takes me so much longer to remember how basic things work just to understand the intricacy of mathematical concepts. This disadvantage carries over into other coursework, because while I understand the concepts behind how to solve certain problems, I execute the solutions very poorly. 

This combined with the rigor of classes here and the fact that everyone, even the 'dumb' people perform much better than me in easy classes has made me lose my passion for learning. I go to bed with a feeling of dread about how much work I have to do to progress just slightly, and have come to accept that I won't understand material even if I go to office hours and pour my heart out into it. I don't even know what interests me anymore. I lack the drive and passion that I once had for learning in high school and constantly think about how my life would be had I attended a different school. I can't transfer out because my GPA is such shit.

I feel like I really don't belong at this school and I'm not smart enough to take any sort of class and do well. Am I relegated to just majoring in Business Management at the premiere engineering school in the nation and hope to god that I can find a job that pays at least 50,000 dollars? I honestly hate how this place has stolen the fire that I once had for learning and replaced it with utter fear and hopelessness. 

Here is my plea:

What the fuck do I do
