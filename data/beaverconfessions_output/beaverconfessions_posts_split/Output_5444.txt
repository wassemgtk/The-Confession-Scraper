I'm doing some public policy research regarding obesity, and I'm having a problem. I'm advocating for some extreme measures to curb obesity in this country. Regulation of fast food, taxing fast food to the max, etc, etc. But I want to propose more drastic options, things such as schools checking the nutrition of children in school and using child welfare services to bring charges against parents who overfeed their children, requiring restaurants to only serve healthy food, banning fast food, etc, etc. Of course, this runs into a ton of legal issues. Free speech issues on advertising, lack of precedence, independence of parents, among others. My whole point is, personal responsibility has proven to not be enough to curb the obesity epidemic. People have proven time and time again that they will not make the right choices when it comes to health, and need to be shoved in the right direction whether by manipulation or outright force. Does anyone know any good legal precedents to use to advocate for some of these actions?
