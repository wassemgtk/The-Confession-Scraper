As a bisexual, I feel completely unwelcome in the LGBT movement. It's all about trans people now, and I literally can't empathize with them no matter how hard I might try. Also, I feel like my problems aren't considered because they're not severe. I don't need the movement anyway, but I do find it sad that it has become so exclusive.
