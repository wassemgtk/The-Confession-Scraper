Damn, Chill people. composure >>> grades.
Someone got all salty after the 14.01 exam, posting anonymously on Piazza:
"Wow
I am glad I went to tutoring three times before this exam, did five practice tests, and studied for numerous hours just to get shafted. I wish Natalia could've told me there would be crap on the exam we never covered because then I wouldn't have wasted my time. So go ahead Natalia and TA's, delete this post. I just wanted you to know that this class is absolute garbage."
