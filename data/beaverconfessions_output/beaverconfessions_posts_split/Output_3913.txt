I went back to MIT for another degree after three years away because I wanted to go back and conquer everything that I had left undone the first time around. I left with an involuntary admission to a psyke ward and several months of a terrifying psychotic episode. I should have just moved on with my life when that was the obvious next step, but I was determined to attempt the impossible until failure slapped me in the face. I didn't expect that failure to look like police restraints and chemicals in my brain.
