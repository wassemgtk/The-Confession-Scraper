I feel like most of us talk about how shitty MIT is and how it needs fixing and how stressful it is, etc. but I've been here for two years and I gotta say - even if MIT has its shitty times - I LOVE MIT. You get things here that you wouldn't get anywhere else. High school was a hellhole for me, and I feel like MIT stretches you in the best ways.

So even when everyone says I Hate This Fucking Place, I'll be screaming:

I Have Truly Found Paradise
