I saw my high five buddy the other day for the first time since late freshman year. I ran up to him and give him a big high five. I'm a senior. I must've looked like a fucking idiot but I made a pact during orientation to high five him whenever I saw him. Made my fucking day to see that he was still hanging in there.

Does MIT still do that during orientation?
