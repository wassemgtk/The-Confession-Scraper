A lot of my friends did some really awesome stuff this summer. I'm happy for them, but I'm not acting as interested as I should be. Honestly, I'm excited that I overcame a bout of depression from Spring, learned how to cook decent chicken, and kept my room clean. I only did several fun things, and now it's over I guess.
