@3063 and other depressed people of MIT, I always want to comment on the contemplating suicide posts, but honestly, I am too scared to say that I've been there on a public forum. But I have been at the point where I could no longer visualize things getting better and the only thing holding me back was not wanting to hurt other people. And it was also my sophomore fall when I came the closest to following through on those desires. But things did get better, and I am so, SO glad that I am not dead now. It took a lot of crap to get from there to here, but it truly has been worth it. For me medication was involved. If you haven't tried it, may as well give it a shot before doing something you can't undo. Anyway, since leaving email addresses seems to be the thing now, and I want to stay anonymous, feel free to email me at decidedagainstkillingmyself@gmail.com if you want to talk. Again, this is not specific to 3063, I'm up for talking to anyone else that is feeling similarly. Try to stick it out, cause the other side is pretty damn nice.
