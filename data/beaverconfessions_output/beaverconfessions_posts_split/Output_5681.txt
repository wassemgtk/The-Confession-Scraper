Friday last week was a friday like any other. I got up, put on jeans, eat cereal, bailed on going to class, then got ready to head out to the park. Then my dickface, asswipe, waste of sexual organs roommate put edibles in my cereal in the hopes that I would go to class high. It worked, I was high. I was so high I could taste emotion and feel colors. Up was happiness and left was pink. And unlike doing drugs intentionally, this had none of the luster. I wasn't sure if I was dead and stuck in limbo, or in some sort of coma. I ultimately decided that I must be lucid dreaming. This was a mistake. The result was I got half naked, pissed myself, and ran to the local park. Don't judge me. As I got to Alberico Park          I found myself with one popsicle and a can of PBR. If I stole these from you, I'm sorry, hit me up on this post and I will repay you. Then I saw her. The most beautiful woman I had ever seen, she had the glimmer of a fresh chipotle wrapper. I would go organic, vegan, and fair trade for you. As I went over to drop my finest pick up lines I tripped and tumbled down a hill. I must have hit my head on a rock because when I woke up you were gone. If you saw a clearly high man with a can of PBR covered in piss trying to talk to you, please hit me up, I would love to take you out to a great vegan place. Also, if anyone knows the jerk who went through my pockets when I was unconscious, I would really appreciate that.
