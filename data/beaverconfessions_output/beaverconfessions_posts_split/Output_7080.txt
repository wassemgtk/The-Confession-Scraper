My ex-boyfriend (not an MIT student, lives 3 hours away) had a mental breakdown and started to believe that he is the Antichrist. He's currently in a mental facility being held against his will because he drove to my hometown and started screaming about it being the devil's den, but I'm so scared that when he gets out he's going to try to kill people. I think I'm on the list, but I'm more afraid he's going to do a mass shooting.
I have spoken to the police, they were instrumental in having him committed for 72+ hours in a special facility (instead of spending only 48 hours in the hospital). But he hasn't made any explicit threats, so no crime has been committed aside from maybe disturbing the peace.
I can't believe this is happening in my life. I'm sitting here working on psets, as if there wasn't a person merely hours away who's locked up, violently deluded, and probably growing more and more angry with every passing minute. At least they can sedate him so he can sleep for the first time in a long timeâ€¦but I don't think he will be cured before he's released.
