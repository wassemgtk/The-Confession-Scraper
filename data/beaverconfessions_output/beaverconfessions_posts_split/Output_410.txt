I have known two friends who committed suicide. It's a rough subject. I've heard some people say in certain cases, what's the big deal if the person is terminally ill or depressed? The big deal is suicide, doesn't just hurt the person who does it, it mentally destroys their loved ones. It hurt me and their other loved ones deeply. To think that the individual was in so much pain that they couldn't bear to live for us shatters you inside. You want to scream at the top of your lungs and ask why couldn't you reach out and ask for help and you knew we would have all done anything for you? Was life with you not worth it for them? But they can no longer answer. Suicide leaves great anguish for those who have to live through it. It's a selfish act of cowards. Dying is easy, living is hard. I've been asked how I feel about the people I know who did it. Nothing will ever stop me from loving them. I choose to love and not hate them, because I don't want my anger about the end to rule me. But, I don't mince words on their wrongs either.
