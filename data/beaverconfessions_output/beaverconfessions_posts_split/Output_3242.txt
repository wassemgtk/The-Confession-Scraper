I'm really stressed about something so I texted "Lean on Me" because I thought it would be an immediate response type thing but it's been an hour and I haven't been connected to someone. I mean I know it's not that long but I thought it would be sooner, I just felt the need to vent right then... Also, Lean on Me should put more information on their website (like how long you should expect to wait or how they choose their supporters/what training they do or what to say in your first message and what to expect from the process,etc.)
