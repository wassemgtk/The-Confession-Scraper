sappointed that you deleted post #3892 just because a few people commented and said that you should. While I disagree with the views expressed by the OP, the post was a statement of opinion, and not a call for violence/oppression. It demanded that people realign their views, not that they should be silenced.

On the other hand, you decided to remove this post in response to a couple of (what I'm assuming) were impulsive comments or jokes. If anything, this reinforces the idea that censorship has gone too far in favor of minority groups. This doesn't help to promote discussion. This won't change OP's mind. You've just made their case for them and contributed to more polarization.
