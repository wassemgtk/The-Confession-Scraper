Here.
All right everyone, chill. I LOVE women, but that doesn't change the truth... It's isn't easy to be a stud. Few men like me who have earned that status get to brag, period. When I see a woman I like, I know she has the ultimate power to decide whether we will have sex or not. The onus is on me to make her desire me. The more women I try to impress, the higher my chances of getting laid- I've gotten pretty good at this shit. A woman doesn't need to work that hard for sex. She doesn't need to pursue many men to up her chances therefore if she gives so readily, she's a slut. It's not PC but it's true.

Let me now take on the haters.
"Who do you think those women that find getting laid so easy are getting laid by? " - They are getting laid by men like me. Alpha males who can sweep them off their feet any time, any day. ;)

The only reasonable responses to my previous post were from Jamie Voros and lowkey from Emma. The rest of you are just mad that I spoke the truth!
