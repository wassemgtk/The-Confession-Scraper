I am often confused by the dichotomy between male and female sexuality.
 In my relationship with my girlfriend, if I were to pressure her for sex, it would be called rape...  whic I'm reminded of by every sex ed message/youtube/PSA out there. I often want sex more often than she does, which leaves her in the position of power attaining sex whenever she wants it.

However, there have been a few occasions in which I did not want sex when she did, and when I told her no, the tears flowed or she got angry, and would continue to pressure me, as if deep down I really did want to have sex, and if she applied the right amount of pressure I'd realize it. 

I find it unfair to be a guy, where the rape rules seem to be one-sided. Women (in a healthy relationship), get all the sex they want, have their boundaries respected, and have no social repercussions for pressuring a yes.
