It feels so triumphant to see the gloomy rain cloud hanging over Boston today. There's a thoroughly deflated atmosphere in the air that juxtaposes my happy-go-lucky, not a care in the world attitude as I simply skip my way to class with a stupid smile on my face. I pause to see the rubble and gloomy construction at Building 12, a fitting metaphor for the events of this past Sunday, with the so-called savior Brady blowing a 14 pt lead against a defense that lost 2 players in the first quarter and being out-dueled by a backup QB. It's nice to stand alone at 11-0.
