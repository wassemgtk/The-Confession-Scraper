#1141 I was arguing with some pro war jerk the other day and he threw this at me like a trump card. So I want to end the taboo on this argument. I do not care what happens to the people of Iraq, Syria, or Afghanistan. If I turn on the news tomorrow and find out that ISIS and the Taliban have taken over and are committing genocide and mass rape against the people at high noon for the world to see I will shrug, sip my coffee, and the change the channel. This is not my problem. I just don't want any more Americans getting hurt or more tax dollars being spent.
