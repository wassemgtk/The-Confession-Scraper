Maybe I'm way off on this, but am I the only one who thinks it's totally insane that the vast majority of exams here are closed book? I've yet to be able to think of a time where one would ever have to do anything without being able to consult notes, textbooks, etc. outside of the completely fabricated situation that is a closed book exam. I guess you wouldn't be able to look at your notes if you were stranded on a desert island or something, but I can't imagine that that's what we're being prepared for. Why do I have to waste so much time making sure I remember formulas, definitions, etc. out of fear that forgetting one small thing could leave me unable to do an entire problem when in real life I'd be able to just quickly look up anything I couldn't remember at the moment and continue on? The only argument I can see against open book exams is that students may just show up for the exams without learning the material, but I'd argue that if you can essentially teach yourself a subject and complete a 50 minute exam in 50 minutes and get a good grade then you deserve it.
