Things I learned at MIT during the length of my undergraduate degree: 
1. I don't actually like science
2. I am not actually good at science
3. I only thought I liked science in high school because I was actually just attracted to scientists
4. Because I was wasting all my time attempting to be good at science I wasn't able to get with any of said scientists
5. In conclusion my life is a fail
also I have nothing lined up after graduation and can't bother to look so will probably just jump off a cliff or something
