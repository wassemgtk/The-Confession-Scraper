Changing the colour of your profile picture is about as potent as liking pictures of sick children on Facebook so they can get surgery. If you really care about the people of France, and the future peace of the world, I suggest that a much better use of your time is finding out a little more about the enemy which threatens us. This very well researched and written article might be a good place to start. Then that way, when politicians start making decisions about how to moderate the crisis, at least you can call up your local senator and say something informed and intelligent.
