6038, I have also gotten rejected by this one girl who liked me but wasn't ready for a relationship due to some other jerk who broke her heart. It happens. Some people aren't ready to date someone due to certain circumstances in their lives. I assume, from the pain you are describing, that you have known this girl for a long time and have been her friend for a few years, so I understand that it can hurt when a girl you like so much and know so well says she cannot go out with you. But you shouldn't take it personally. I am SURE there are other circumstances in her life that are preventing her from going out with you even if she likes you. But I would say that it probably is better that you do not go out with someone at this time because if this situation makes you suicidal, maybe it is best not to go out with someone because relationships usually end, and trust me, that will hurt more than anything in the world.
