There's this guy who I see at the student center all the time. He of course doesn't know or notice, but I think he's the most attractive guy I've ever seen. I think he is (was?) part of Amphibz, and I think I've seen him wear a Phi Delts shirt sometime. I'm pretty sure he's not into dudes, but dang, I've been wanting to talk to him and get to know him. Here's to hoping?
