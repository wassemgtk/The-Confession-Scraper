MIT is a hard place, I'm not going to deny that. And yet I think that sometimes we get so caught up in the difficulties that we encounter here that we lose sight of the positive aspects. I don't just mean the job opportunities or degrees that we earn, or all of the amazing people that we get to meet. I mean the belief that it can give us in ourselves. 

I've doubted myself and my abilities my entire life despite the fact that I've generally been pretty good at most things that I've tried. All throughout high school, I was afraid to take on challenges, and I was afraid to believe in myself, because I thought that I wasn't good enough. Then I came to MIT. I had always heard about how it could beat you down, about how if you were once at the top of your class, you would find yourself struggling to stay in the middle of the pack. When I started on my first day, I was terrified.

But something weird happened--I didn't fail. For the first time in my life, I allowed myself to take on a challenge that I truly believed I wouldn't be able to handle. And instead of crashing and burning, I did well. I got A's and joined clubs and picked up hobbies. I made friends and became more social. I learned that even though MIT was hard, I could handle it. And that's been one of the most rewarding experiences in my life.

I know that MIT can be incredibly difficult. I've spent just as many nights as the next person sacrificing sleep for the two midterms and three psets due the next day. I've gone through entire classes not knowing what the hell was going on. And I know that I am lucky that I have been able to handle it.

Not everyone will have a story like mine. Many people will learn what it is like to fail, and some people may not make it through all four years to be able to say that in the end, MIT was worth it. 

I guess that all I wanted to say in this post was something positive about MIT. It gets a lot of shit. It's easy to point out its faults, and it's easy to complain about the stress and the workload. It punishes a lot of people, and I don't want to minimize their struggle. It's not a place that will benefit everyone. 

But on behalf of those of us that it does, I'd like to thank MIT. It's been a rough ride. But for me, without a doubt, it's been worth it.
