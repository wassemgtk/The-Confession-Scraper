I was diagnosed with adhd and anxiety late this semester and several people here are suggesting that I take some time off of being here. while I have personally considered this several times (I've lost a lot of self-confidence, and perhaps a break would give me more perspective), my parents would not be okay with me taking time off. they're the kind of parents who, despite being given several hints that I could have adhd back in elementary school, told me to be more disciplined. this semester, I had a panic attack and called them (because, at the time, I couldn't think of anyone else to call) and my dad basically responded to this by saying "just don't panic". what's the best way of bringing mental health / possibly leaving MIT up with them in the most productive way possible?
