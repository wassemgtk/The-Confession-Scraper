Anyone feel hopeless in 2.086 
Like every assignment I hand in I'm like this is gonna be the one I finally get full points for...but nope, -20 for one mistake here and another there...and this upcoming midterm which is like 40% of the grade is not helping. 
Anyone who took this class before in its current form have words of wisdom/comfort 
Like how much is this midterm gonna suck...what are the letter grade cut offs???
