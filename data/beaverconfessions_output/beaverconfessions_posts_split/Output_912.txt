@7512: You have the privilege of studying at one of the best universities in the world with a practically guaranteed white-collar career after graduation, but are stealing from a convenience store where the first people your actions are likely to hurt are the lowest-paid service employees. I don't know you or what you've been through in life, but please consider how your actions affect those who now have less than you.
