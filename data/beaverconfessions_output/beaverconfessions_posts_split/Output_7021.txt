this is getting ridiculous. it feels like we should still be together and i can't tell how much of this is me trying to deny the facts and hope blindly and how much of this is the fact that you're still around me all the time. i can't even tell if you actually want to be around me or if you just feel like you have to anymore. 

i let you go because it felt like you wanted to go. now you're just staying at this awkward distance. if i could have my way i'd take you back and keep you all for myself. but it feels like for your sake i have to really let go.
