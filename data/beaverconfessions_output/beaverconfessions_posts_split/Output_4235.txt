I’m falling apart mentally. These past two weeks have been hell for my head and I simply can’t do anything about it. I want to go to MIT medical for help but I can barely afford school as it is. If I were to also get mental health services I wouldn’t be able to go here anymore. I just have to suck it up and get over it. I built a circuit to shock myself with a few hundred volts. Nothing lethal, but a fair bit of pain. It’s like cutting myself, but doesn’t leave a mark. Perfect. That’s what I call MIT ingenuity. Overall my mind just feels like a car making a loud grinding noise under the hood. Sure, nothing’s broken yet, but you know that if you keep driving, it’s going to be catastrophic. This ought to be a fun semester. And I’m only a freshman too. Not even 20% done with this place. Yay. I wish I could have stayed home over IAP and had an extended break. I thought I should come back to school and develop my skills and grow as a person. Looking like I should have just stayed home around the support of my family. I don’t know what I’m doing. I guess I just have to make it to spring break, when I get to go home.

Also I wish this place had more off days. Just a random monday here and there with no classes. Even if it pushed the semester so we didn’t finish until june, everything would just be much more manageable.

Right now I just really hate this school and all its underlying messages.

Let’s see how long it will take for me to get over my sorry ass and start doing something useful.
