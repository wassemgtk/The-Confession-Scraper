I sense a lot of tension in political views that are being expressed on MIT confessions. While I think it is great that people are expressing their views and that it has resulted in discussion, it makes me think, why don't we do this face to face? Personally, due to the MIT bubble and other things, I don't feel nearly as politically informed as I would like to be. I think it would be great to have a group of 10 students or so at MIT with all different views on the political issues that have been so vehemently discussed on MIT confessions and elsewhere to have an open discussion where other MIT students can watch and listen. I think it would be informative, even cathartic to some, and encourage openness and help all students learn more about different views and perhaps get closer to the truth. Open discussion and forcing one's self to hear all angles is essential to forming a well-informed view.
