I wish people would speculate less and reach out to each other more. We all know this place is very stressful. On top of work, though, many have other stressful factors in their lives at one point or another. You are all so loved and whatever is causing you pain, we want to help you through it. RIP Christina and Matthew. We miss you so much.
