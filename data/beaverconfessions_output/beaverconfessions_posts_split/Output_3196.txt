I feel so intensely relieved after talking to my therapist about ADD. It's like this constant guilt of not being able to work hard enough, do enough, discipline myself enough is lifted and its not because I won't still feel these, its just there's actually a way to improve it and its not for my lack of trying.  She said "You didn't come here to suffer.  It's college, you're free!" and told me to go do some sport that I'd always wanted to do, or pick up doodling in class more if it helps.  It just feels so nice to have someone understand something that's been eating away at your belief in your ability to accomplish anything for so long. 10/10 would recommend.
