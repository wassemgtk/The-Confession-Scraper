I'm not sure if #1288 is directed at me, or it is just a similar case. But, in case it is, I would like to state this publicly (because the current couple of comments and 21 likes on that post piss me off). The truth is, you did things to me I had explicitly requested you not to do. Regardless of whether or not I slept with other people, this is bad. Although I don't care that much because it didn't end up resulting in pregnancy, I almost feel the responsibility to speak up/stand up for other women who may place more emotional/psychological value in sex. The reason I am keeping this secret in real life is purely for your sake, so if you keep that attitude up and piss me off more, maybe I WILL speak out. (and when I say, I don't care that much, I mean now that I know I'm not pregnant. The during the couple of weeks of absolute terror, I did care)
Now, regarding cheating, the agreement was don't ask, don't tell, and pretend I'm yours. You asked and gave me no choice but to tell. I wouldn't have told you otherwise.
