I've been struggling with depression for the last few years now. In general I will only ever ask for help as an extreme last resort. In addition talking about my feelings is even less appealing to me. 

Despite this, I've gotten to the point where I've literally said to my friends "I'm pretty depressed" in the hopes that I could get some support from them. As a result they kinda just say some words of encouragement and I end up just letting the topic change. None of them have ever struggled with mental health issues and don't seem even capable of registering what it means to be depressed and to be honest I get the feeling that they just don't even give a fuck. 

It took everything I had to admit to them that I was depressed and they can't even help me and don't seem interested in trying. It's extremely discouraging to think that I don't have a single "friend" that could even remotely relate to some of the things that I feel. 

I've tried talking to people at mental health but it just makes me really uncomfortable to talk about something so personal with a complete stranger. 

Guess I'll just have to keep struggling by myself.
