'm alright most of the time. But there are times when everything is just far too much: all the homework, keeping up my long distance relationship, and still trying to be somewhat social so I don't lose the couple good friends I have? Add trying to figure out what I want to do with my life. I feel like I'm just barely skimming along, getting what I need done but letting anything not on the top of my priority list just be forgotten. I sometimes feel there is no winning.
