There's something wrong with discussion at MIT.

Last year, my living group proposed a new rule. During the meeting, we agreed it would only pass if everybody was okay with it. A lot of people told me they were uncomfortable with the change, but once the next meeting came around, nobody wanted to speak up. Nobody wanted to be painted as 'uncool', or 'against personal freedom'. The measure passed, unanimously.

This happens way too often. Once an idea gets 60% support, people that disagree get shamed. Once it passes 70%, it's "unanimous". After 80%, it's unthinkable that anybody could disagree. And yet the minority still exists.

You see this dynamic play out every day on this page. Somebody posts an argument for a right-wing point -- usually not a very good argument, but an argument nonetheless. People only respond with snark. It's like they're thinking, well, everybody sane agrees with me, and we all agree what the right answer is, so I don't even have to try to argue back. Let's just make fun of this idiot who hasn't gotten the message yet. 

Except, not everybody agrees with you. It's only 70%, and if you walk a few miles out of MIT, it's only 30%. Snark has never changed anybody's mind. All you're doing is making people like you feel smug, weirding out moderates, and shaming the minority into silence.
