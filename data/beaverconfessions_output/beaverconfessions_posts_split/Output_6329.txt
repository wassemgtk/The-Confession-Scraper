I hate when people discredit complaints about 6.170 by saying "oh but 172 is harder!" Yeah, guess what, 6.172 is also an 18 unit class. Just because its "harder" than my 12 unit class that has weekly projects that take 20+ hours along with 4 hours of class a week does not mean that the 6.170 staff is in the right.
