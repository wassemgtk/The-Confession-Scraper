Lunch at Maseeh always seems to reach new levels of lazy horseshit everytime I eat there. Today the grill decided to say fuck it and remove any pretenses that they actually care about food quality and put out the burgers, chicken and quesadillas all in the same goddamn pan instead of cooking them to order. Don't know if it ever crossed their minds that juice from the meat would make the quesadillas soggy but either way I don't know why I pay for a dining plan anymore. Fuck.
