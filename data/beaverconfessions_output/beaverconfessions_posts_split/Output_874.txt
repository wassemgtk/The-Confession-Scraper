I wish I were more feminine but I always feel like a clown when I dress up and I don't want people to think that I'm a ditz so I usually act very serious (however, I do have a sense of humor). I'm more comfortable wearing masculine clothing and no makeup, but sometimes I wish that I could be breezy and beautiful like so many girls on this campus and still genuine. Any tips on how to be more feminine without being over-the-top or superficial?
