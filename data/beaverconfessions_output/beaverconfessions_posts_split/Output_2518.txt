Everyone needs to calm the fuck down, Trevor doesn't deserve the backlash he's getting. Honestly, everyone is overreacting; don't use this to further your "Black lives matter" agenda and throw him under the bus. How dare you say that Trevor and the council "don't belong at MIT" just because of something he said that happened to strike a nerve. Take a moment to think about what you're saying before you also say something that you regret. What you are saying is just going to isolate people from each other and create tension; you're not getting anywhere by starting a Facebook shitstorm. If it really bothers everyone so much, go talk to him in person and tell him how you feel, don't hide behind a fucking Facebook wall. Also, he apologized so stop posting your "opinions" everywhere, no one wants to hear them.
