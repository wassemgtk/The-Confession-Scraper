The Chancellor and SHAC (Student Housing Advisory Committee) have been strongly considering, among other things, moving to a single freshman dorm.  I imagine that most people (including myself) would be very unhappy about this, and the UA and DormCon have known about this for months, and yet have refused to tell the general undergraduate population about it.  Can we please just talk about this?
