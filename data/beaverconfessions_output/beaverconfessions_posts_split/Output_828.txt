to the people who are done with finals. shut the fuck up. nobody wants to hear how excited you are about summer. we're all still drying our tears with practice finals so we don't feel like complete shit after we get fucked by our remaining finals. and seniors, i'm happy for you but please take your lucky-to-be-alive attitude to harvard or BU because you should understand how sucky and hormonal we feel amidst MIT finals right now. thanks.
