I want to share a little story about a lesson I learned. The other day I was in my room and my roommates and I were about to go get dinner in 15 minutes. So I thought I would have a little fun in the meantime. So I hit up my favorite porn site and get to work. It's then I realize, I'm out of lube. I decide to substitute water. So I'm about to finish, and fellows, you know how towards the end you really start speeding up. Unfortunately the water caused my hand to hydroplane off my dick and smashed into the monitor, cracking it, and cutting my knuckles, blood dripping down my hand. Here's the dialog that ensued.

Me: "YAAAUUUUGGGHHHH!"
Roommate1: "What happened?!"
Me: "Nothing!"
Roommmate1: "That doesn't sound like nothing, come on lets get dinner."
Me: "Sure, just got to bandage my hand."
Roommate2: "Dude, you just hydroplaned off your dick and smashed up your hand! I knew you would do this again!"
Me: "No I didn't! And fuck you!"
Roommate2: "If I come in, are you saying your monitor won't be cracked, and covered in blood and cum?"
Me: "Alright fine I did! You happy?!"
Roommate1: "Just clean up and get out here."

The moral of this story is don't use water as a lubricant for masturbation, as hydroplaning off your dick is no laughing matter.
