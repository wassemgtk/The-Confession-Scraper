Evolution naturally exists to move away from undesirable traits in a population, all the while increasing diversity so that the population as a whole becomes more resistant to being wiped out by one event. I think that's a distinction that gets faded by super "accept everyone" liberal environments. Diversity is sweet, celebrate that shit m8. But undesirable traits shouldn't be celebrated. Tl;dr: "Thin privilege" doesn't exist, it's called evolution.
