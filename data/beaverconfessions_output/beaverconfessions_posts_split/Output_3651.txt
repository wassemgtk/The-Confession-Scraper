I'm afraid to like the post about putting signs in Lobby 7 because I know the candidates. But honestly? The poster was sloppily done, the print was ugly, and it wasn't even hung straight. It doesn't take any effort to hang a sign from lobby 7. It just made Lobby 7 look ugly, much unlike the fun things occasionally done to Lobby 7 that, I don't know, actually took effort. To be fair, she has ideas and she cares, I just think she goes about it in a very annoying manner. 
Also, if I ever hear the candidates talking in class about, oh, how this is so easy, then you can guarantee you will never have my vote. Because all you are doing is making those around you feel like shit. Not everyone learned this in high school.
