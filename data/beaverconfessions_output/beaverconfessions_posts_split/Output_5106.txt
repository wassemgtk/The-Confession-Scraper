I want to toss myself into the charles like I do when I go to bed.
The river will be my blanket, swath me with suffocation, as I descend deeper into sleep.
Until i reach the bottom, where I hope I may never be woken up again. 
Sleeping with all this commotion around me. With everything blurred through the haze of water.
Where the sun will barely reach.
