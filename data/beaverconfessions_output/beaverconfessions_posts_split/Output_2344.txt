I'm a guy who loves noisy, gnarly, dirty lo-fi music. I love post-punk music. I love deathrock (which isn't what you think). I love noise rock. And I've found that just about every girl I know out there can't stand that type of music, and as soon as a girl I like finds out that I do, it just turns her off. I guess listening to this stuff means you like to drown puppies in buckets of poison. I'm not putting down people who don't share my taste; I'm just tired of past and current girlfriends putting me down for my taste. To the guys out there who share my taste, have you dated girls who like this kind of music? And if not, how did you make your relationship work when all she did was complain about hearing your music while you hear hers nonstop?
