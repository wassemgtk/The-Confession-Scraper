Why do some east campus people think the world knows all about east campus? This is not most (or even many) people, but there's a small minority that are like this. If I ask "where do you live again?" they look offended and shocked and reply "tetazoo" ///obviously like how could you forget the greatest place ever omg/// (it's not just this floor I'm just using that one instance as an example). And then this (very small) minority 
won't converse normally either. Literally just asking what happened that caused your injury, and I get a full blown "this pirate ship sailed up the river and I was challenged to a duel!!" Like ok.....
