Sometimes I procrastinate on my homework. And I think to myself "okay, I can't get up to go pee or eat anything or drink anything until I finish half of this homework." 
And then I don't end up eating for days and not sleeping for days and I have definitely peed myself at least once because I am too stubborn to go to the bathroom but also too lazy to focus and do my PSET..... okay go for it how weird am I.
