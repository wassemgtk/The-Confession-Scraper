As a gender-binary  privileged person, can anyone explain to me why there are so many different genders and why it's important to know them? I understand there is a distinction between you biological sex and what gender you choose to identify as, but what are the other types and why are there so many? Is it important to call you something? I don't think I've ever been particularly offended even when I've been mistaken as a girl when I was a kid. Is it offensive to call someone who is biologically a female a female? Like if I say "Sir, you dropped your wallet" will you be slightly annoyed?

In my head, there should be 3-5 solid genders you can identify with and we can all just call it a day.Like there are only so many possible combinations/permutations.
