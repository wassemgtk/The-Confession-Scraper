Does anyone else feel overwhelmed by MIT support resources to the point where you actually don't even know what they are? Like what is Peer2Peer? Mind Heart Hand idk if that's even it? I just keep getting emails about more new things and it's pretty overwhelming in a bad way. Can we just have like...5 solid things that cover all the bases? I don't want to have to sit down and google for 30 min to figure out what each does before using one.
