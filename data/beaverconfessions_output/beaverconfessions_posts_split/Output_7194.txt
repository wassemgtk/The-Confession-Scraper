I made a mistake last semester. It nearly cost me my year at MIT. I feel so shitty just thinking about it. Though I managed not to lose a whole year, I did lose my friends. I wish I could redo it - but I can't. Thing is, I can't move on if you won't too; the pitiful look on your face everytime you see me kills me inside.
