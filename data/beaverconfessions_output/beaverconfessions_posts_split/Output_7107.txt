I thought I had everything put together. I knew what I wanted to do, loved my classes (still do really), but these days I can barely keep a straight face. Everything that could go wrong this past week did. It seems so fucking surreal. My best friend is hospitalized for a hole in her heart. My parents are going through struggles of their own that make me so guilty for being here and unable to help. Then Phoebe. I can't sleep, I don't want to talk to anyone, I feel like collapsing and screaming all the time, but I can't even get myself to cry it out. Meanwhile school work keeps piling and it's getting out of hand, I'm not able to do justice to the people in the extracurricular activities I'm in. Being around people stresses me out, and I just want to be left alone, but at the same time it's so lonely. I think I just want to curl up and go to sleep for a long time.
