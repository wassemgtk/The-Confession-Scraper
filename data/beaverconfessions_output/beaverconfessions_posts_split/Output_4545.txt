I feel like everything in my life has become so political, and I spend more time trying to be diplomatic and acting in a way that would serve my office and my community well, as well as not taint my reputation. I know I'm doing this because I care, and that this is what a smart person in my position would do, but sometimes I wonder if I traded honesty for what "looks good". I think it's starting to affect interpersonal relations, and it's killing me inside, as I may have lost the only person I could trust recently simply because they don't fully trust me anymore. Just because I think a few steps ahead, and am witty and clever at opportune moments, it doesn't mean I have a secret agenda for everything. 

Trust me, please. You're all I've got...
