@#3063, I also have always had that feeling. I ne'er thought I would leave past 30. My feeling is somewhat reasonable because most of my relatives live 20-40 years. I feel like my family is dying young and I am perfectly comfortable with that. No matter how blandly I mess up, I know I'll be dead soon.
