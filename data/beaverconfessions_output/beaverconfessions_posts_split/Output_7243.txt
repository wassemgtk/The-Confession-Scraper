Hello everybody. This is MIT speaking. No this is not a troll. Yes, it is actually the entity of MIT/the spirit of MIT/MIT incarnate speaking to you. And I have a motivational message for you.
Message: You should always tell yourself that you are beautiful, strong and capable individuals. Decades of personal observation have shown me that those who try this technique tend to lose hope and become sleep-deprived, emotionless, heartless social outcasts much slower than the rest of us do here, even though you all will get to that at some point. But you should disregard the fact that I, MIT, will screw you and believe that you are strong, beautiful and capable, even though you aren't. I just wanted to inspire you to believe that you are capable of overcoming any of the various difficulties I have designed to break your spirit, though in fact you never will. Anyways, keep smiling that big smile of yours, which incidentally makes you seem ignorant of all the devils and plagues of thirst, hunger and p sets that I have lined up fr you, and have a great day!
MIT over and out
