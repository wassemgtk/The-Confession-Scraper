I'm almost certain that I'm going to be a hermit. 

I just want to go to a forest/cave and meditate for 18 hours a day every day for the rest of my life.

I used to want to struggle against the NWO, to save mankind, to make a difference, all that jazz. Now I only want to observe, as if I'm in some horrible experiment gone wrong or an alien visitor to another planet. We're all facets of the same being, and I wish I didn't know any of this, so why should I tell others what I know?

I have no friends, nothing tying me to this path. I'm a philosopher, I don't care about money or people, and I become more cynical about science day by day fnord. I want to traverse the astral planes, talk to tulpas, and smoke weed with ETs.
