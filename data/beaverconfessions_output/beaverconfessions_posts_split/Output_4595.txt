This is for #3847.
Pure Meritocracy. Hardwork and diligence can not be measured in GPA. Unfortunately, there's nothing much we can do about that. I'm EECS to, and people who get these Google internships are pretty much set for life. Or at least they have a better chance at life because they have Google on their resume. It's a dog eat dog world out there. Fuck these kids working for the new and coolest companies. Be yourself and do a cool project. Start your own company and make these smart people work for you. Maybe endeavor to do something aside from taking the easy way out and working for some hot shot company or professor. I believe in you, because you represent the majority of MIT students weren't good or lucky enough to score that internship or do well on that one test.
