Coming from an EC resident: Why the fuck do certain people here not wear shoes outside?? Even in the rain??? 
1. I don't want to smell or see your feet for that matter. 
2. What are you trying to prove? People in 3rd world countries literally cannot afford shoes. 
3. You're gonna end up cutting your foot on glass or something. 

It literally takes 5 seconds to put on shoes. 5 seconds for safety and everyone else comfort. Plis
