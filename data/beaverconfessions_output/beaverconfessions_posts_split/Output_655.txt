I learned hypnosis to help my dad with pain and stress. Now I'm good at making people feel good. Sometimes I just let them relax and let them feel the inner happiness, the one they felt when they read decisions.mit.edu. 
I also practice self hypnosis. It feels good when the brainwave activity reaches alpha stage, you know 8-13 cycles per second, I can literally reprogram my subconscious to achieve resilience.
