To all of the "oppressed" women and minorities: How oppressed must you be that this country gives you loud platform and attention on a national scale? How oppressive is it to have your views be the norm? If I say "I'm not a feminist" or "I don't believe in equality," I will get lambasted by 80% or more of my peers. Meanwhile, leftists masquerade as "radicals" and "activists." Here's a newsflash. It's not difficult when the system is 100% by your side. It's not difficult when the media offers you positive attention every day and readily accepts your narrative as truth. As you hurtle our nation towards regressive destruction, think on this: You're no longer against the system. You're part of it. It's not edgy, it's not risky, it's not cool. You're not the hippies anymore, and it's not new. The real rebels are demonized. We have to wear masks. You don't. WE face our careers ending on a daily basis for refusing to accept your lies and pseudo-righteousness. You don't. WE have to sit through your diversity talks and gender supremacist presentations, and WE get called nazis when we speak up. So who is really oppressed? 

Things are starting to change. You can see it in Europe, and you can see it here. You've brought it upon yourselves, and people are beginning to wonder why they've been asleep so long. People are starting to say "I am a national socialist, a fascist, a nationalist, an authoritarian, an unspeakable...and I'm proud of it!" I'd rather be a nazi backed by truth than a social justice "warrior" fighting a paved battle against it. You are the establishment now. And we are the new right.
