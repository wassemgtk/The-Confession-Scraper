As tough as it was I decided to vote for Hilary Clinton. Although I find myself very attracted to Bernie Sanders and his devil may care leftist Hilary I feel is the better long term choice. Bernie is the bad boy you love to date with the sexy attitude and wild ways. But Hilary is the kind of candidate you can take home to your parents and settle with for the rest of your life, the kind you could see yourself making more liberals with. Hilary is marriage material.
