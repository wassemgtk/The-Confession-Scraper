As someone how has been in protests before I want to let everyone know something about participating that seems to go over some peoples heads. If you get arrested or temporarily detained by police at them, DO NOT physically resist in any way. This means don't lie as dead weight, don't refuse to put your hands behind your back, don't spit on the officer, don't refuse to walk or get in the car. Even if it is an unlawful arrest, do not resist physically. If it is unlawful, by not resisting, and getting the information down, you set yourself up for a solid case in court of unlawful arrest. But if you resist, that alone is a crime in every jurisdiction, and the supreme court has ruled that the police have the legal right to use as much force as needed to detain you. Police usually interpret that as beating the resister as much as they think they can get away with. More importantly, the fact that you commit a crime there, will nullify your case for unlawful arrest regardless of the original reason, and on top of that you just got your ass kicked for nothing. I say this, because I've seen a few fools who resisted and got charges slapped against them while peacefully and lawfully protesting. I know it's wrong that the officer unlawfully arrests people, but you need to check your ego at the door. By staying cool and playing smart, not aggressive, you can win legal cases, and secure your rights.
