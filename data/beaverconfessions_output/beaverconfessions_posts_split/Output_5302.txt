It’s beginning to feel a lot like fuck this,
soon finals will start
I’ve got a p-set due at eight, I think It might be late
and a group project where i’ve yet to do my part

it’s beginning to feel a lot like fuck this
tests in every class
on material I haven’t learned, and the grade that I have earned
means I need to more than pass

A pair of projects are due and a essay is too
I don’t think i’m sleeping tonight
A grade thats so low, I can’t score far below
one hundred, the margin’s quite tight 
And I can hardly wait to be done with this great fright
