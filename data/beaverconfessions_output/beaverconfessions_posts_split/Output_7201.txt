All of my friends are bogged down with the idea of failure. They want things fast and now, and they don't understand that the wonderful things they're trying to do take time in which not many will appreciate their work. The lack of immediate success is not equivalent to failure, and I wish they could see that, although I understand that they need to fall upon this realization themselves.
