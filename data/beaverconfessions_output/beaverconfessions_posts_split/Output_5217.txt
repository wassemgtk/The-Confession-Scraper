There's a boy on the floor upstairs who is super cute and awesome and kind. I see him everyday and he always takes the time to ask about my day and genuinely listen. So rare in this hellhole. Why is he so nice?? But as much as I'd like to be in a relationship with him, he is probably super straight and dead week is not the time. Maybe he might be into experimenting. Gah. I'll be thinking about him until spring term...
