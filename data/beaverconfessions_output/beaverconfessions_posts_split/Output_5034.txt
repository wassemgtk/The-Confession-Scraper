I get way too close to people like I start out knowing a person and being like "wow this person is amazing" and I want, I mean I _need_ to get close to this person because I can feel how much they change my life just by existing and how much more they can change it and more often than not I succeed and they really _do_ change my life, but eventually it's just this one person that ends up taking over my entire vision I end up worshipping them and I can't get them out of my mind and all my conversations with myself are just imagined conversations with _them_ and I end up needing so so so much more than just friendship that I end up feeling a need to cut them out of my life because I can't deal with the pain of being close to a person but not being as close as humanly possible

And by the end of any of these friendships I always turn out to be a pretty shitty person
