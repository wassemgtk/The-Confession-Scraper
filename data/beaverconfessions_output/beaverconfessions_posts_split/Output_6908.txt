I'm an awful person. 
I have a girlfriend, and my best friend has a boyfriend. Despite this, the two of us constantly flirt and talk about how we're going to date in a year or two. I talk to my friend much more than I talk to my girlfriend, and when I do talk to her, I can't help but be overcome with immense guilt.
