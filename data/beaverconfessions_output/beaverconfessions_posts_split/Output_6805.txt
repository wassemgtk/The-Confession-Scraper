It's getting harder and harder to come back after every break. I spent half an hour the night before school started again crying out of fear and frustration. 

I am scared of this place. I am scared of the pressure. I am scared of feeling like a failure. I am scared that there are, were, will be, people scared or made miserable enough by this place that they felt there was no option better than ending their life. I am scared I may one day be one of those people.

I have friends here that I love more than anything in the world. But that's becoming the only reason I come back. I ask myself, why am I choosing to be somewhere where I am so miserable?

I wish I could remember the reasons I've stayed. There must have been more.
