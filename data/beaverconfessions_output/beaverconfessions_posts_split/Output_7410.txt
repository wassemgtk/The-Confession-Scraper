On the subject of pet peeves in lecture... I hate it when kids who sit on their laptops all class and aren't paying attention waste everyone's time by interrupting the professor to ask a question that was just asked or directly answered 5 minutes ago. Ask someone next to you or accept that if you aren't paying attention you submit your right to ask questions and distract the rest of us.
