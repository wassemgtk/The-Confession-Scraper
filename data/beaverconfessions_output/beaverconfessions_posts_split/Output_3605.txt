I'm a course 6 senior and my parents keep pressuring me to apply for Ph.D. programs, but I really don't want to because I'm already kind of sick of school. They keep telling me that I'll get nowhere without one and they don't believe me when I say that's not true for computer science. Why can't they be proud of me for at least doing a masters?
