Now, there has been some talk in the past about whether Hillary Clinton is qualified to be president. I personally believe that she is. Hillary Clinton is definitely the most qualified Democratic candidate to protect the interests of American imperialism. Sure, Bernie Sanders certainly does try, such as with his support of drone warfare, but he just doesn't seem as committed. There's no heart, no conviction. I'm sorry to say, but the old Brooklynite just does not have the stomach to orchestrate something like a Latin American coup. How can he be president if he will refuse to partake in such a time-honored American tradition? As a proud American patriot, I must in good conscience endorse Hillary Clinton for president, for she is the only one who can maintain the level of cold-blooded terror that the United States of America is known for.
