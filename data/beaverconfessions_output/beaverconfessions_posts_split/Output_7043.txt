so i just got a flu shot and the needle penetrated my arm first the tip and then the rest of the shaft  and in that moment i was the luckiest person alive it felt so BEAUTIFUL i was being injected with SCIENCE and i just wanted to weep i sat in the chair and the chair didn’t collapse because some people engineered it and why did they go through all that trouble like they had to design it and get the materials and stuff to make it and there were different people who had to mine the aluminum or whatever and i was sitting my ass on it and thinking of all the people around me in this orderly line to get pricked and the logistics and HOLY SHIT all the people it took to make that vaccine and all the people it took to streamline that process to make that oozing magic syrup and the fact that they have to fucking synthesize a new one each year and all the people before them who figured out stuff about viruses and nucleic acids and stuff and how far they had come from the beginnings of germ theory and holy shit to figure that out that had to do chemistry and stuff toiling that we might not suffer and even those people were standing on giants' shoulders and it's all because of science which is really just a word for being honest and being willing to admit it when you’re proven wrong ‘cause it’s the truth that matters and you have to work together since you can’t do it alone just like the people who made the chair and you have to trust that the others are behaving in good faith and how is this even fucking possible it’s a fucking positive sum game and you fucking BET we’re going to hit that herd immunity threshold it’s CIVILIZATION how lucky lucky am i and you too and i wonder if civilization is still in its infancy but holy fuck holy fuck against the staggering staggering odds how far yes just how far our pathetic pathetic little species has come
