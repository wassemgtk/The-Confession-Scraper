I was reading a teaching from a church I won't name, but it stated that if you accept Jesus and are baptized you are saved and go to heaven regardless of your sins. That makes no logical or practical sense. So I get baptized, then I can go out and commit a ton of horrendous crimes and then it doesn't matter I'm good? lol I'm not religious, but how on earth do those clueless fools think they can get any converts with that message. You have to sell the message of you need us, not you're good regardless.
