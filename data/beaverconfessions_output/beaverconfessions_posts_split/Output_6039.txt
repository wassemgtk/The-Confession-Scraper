Which significant real world problems will 6.004 and 6.033 help me solve? (I need a non-super-nerdy answer, note the emphasis on significant real world problems for real people with real issues). I'm wondering whether/how these courses will ever be applicable in anything other than building a CPU, which I do NOT want to do...
