last year i was having a pretty hard time dealing with depression and general stress about career stuff. i ended up not really doing anything over the summer because i wanted to take a break, which didn't really end up so well because i had a lot of family issues i forgot about. this semester i finally feel like im back on track. ive been prescribed medicine for my depression and im waking up earlier and going to all my classes. i feel like im finally learning the things im really interested in, and im doing better at socializing. its only been a few weeks so far, but i think im on the track to better things. i feel like im finally myself again. to anyone who feels like they're in a hole right now, get help--things can get better.
