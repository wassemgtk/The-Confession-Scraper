I’m thankful for all the great memories I have made in my 3.5 years at MIT. Sure, I’ve spent about 50% of my time here in classrooms, labs, and on the 5th floor of the Stud, but the biggest memories that stand out are East Campus v West Campus snowball fights, going down the Stata Slide drunk, sneaking into Walden Pond after hours, and getting to spend time with all the brothers in my fraternity. On top of that, I’m thankful for the opportunity I’ve been given to study at one of the most prestigious universities in the world and getting to study and collaborate alongside some of the most brilliant, creative, and diverse motherfuckers I will ever meet.
