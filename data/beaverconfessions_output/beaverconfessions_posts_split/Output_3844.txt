I've spent much of my life feeling like I was never really a part of any group I joined. That, in every group of friends I had, they were all friends with each other while I was just a hanger-on. I felt like no girl would ever love me. Sometimes the loneliness would swell up to the point where I could do nothing but curl up in a ball for a couple hours.

I'm still embarassed to admit it, but a few years back I started working with a dating/social coach, and that's when I started to improve fast and started to feel like I had some control over my social life. I think I still sometimes carry an aura of awkwardness, but I've now had a couple girlfriends, and a number of friends (close and casual) that would have floored the old me.

My old coach is coming to MIT to give a workshop, Saturday 6:30 PM in 8-219. I feel a bit weird advertising on MIT Confessions, but seeing so many people complain about loneliness on this page, and remembering how much it changed my life when I attended my first workshop a while back, I'd feel awful if I didn't.
