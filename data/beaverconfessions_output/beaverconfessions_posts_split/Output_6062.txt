I really loved my living group when I first got to MIT, but this year I feel really disconnected with the people here. I'm the type of person who likes to hang out at home, so it's been really lonely for me. I want to switch dorms but feel as though it may be too late to make friends in a new place (I'm a Sophomore). How welcoming do you think your dorm or living group would be to a new person like me? Would you recommend moving there? I'm really just looking for a welcoming place where the residents like to spend time together. Thanks! :)
