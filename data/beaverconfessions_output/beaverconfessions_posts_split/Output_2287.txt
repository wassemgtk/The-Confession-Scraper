So, here's the thing. I belong to a sorority that prides itself on its so called "diversity". As someone who is a double minority (a woman and a POC) at MIT and in the STEM fields or higher education in general I think it's a joke every time they say this. I don't think having a group where there are 120+ members and then having only 3 girls be Black and maybe 3-4 girls be Hispanic when everyone else is either white or Asian is diversity especially when we talked about recruitment outfits and you guys just assumed we should wear the same makeup or wear the same exact hair style. If you guys actually appreciated diversity you would understand what is wrong with that. I understand that we should look uniform for Recruitment but if you're going to brag about how diverse we are then why try to whitewash every girl in the chapter? That is why I think it's a joke. And this is not to say that I don't love my fellow sisters. But honestly, having one type of minority in a group does not make you diverse and it's a bit offensive to me for you guys to think that people that look like me are well-represented simply because their is one other girl of my race in a 120+ chapter when everyone knows very well that if the roles were reversed you wouldn't be singing the same tune.
