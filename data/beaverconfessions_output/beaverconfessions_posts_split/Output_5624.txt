Whenever I see a tech caller ad, it reminds me of a time back in freshman year when I was caught by a group of people in lobby 10 trying to recruit new tech callers. At the time, I was going through some very rough times (family issues, financial issues, depression, self-image issues, suicial thoughts, name it all) and had a difficult time to focus on my classes, let alone commit myself to something else. So I politely told them that I cannot join because I have too much things on my plate. One of the recruiters decided that he wanted to make a snide comment about how in *his* freshman year, he had "5 classes, 2 clubs, and a UROP and still did tech caller just fine." I wish I can go back in time and slap him across the face and tell him the shit I was going through. That comment still makes me angry/sad/depressed and I'm a senior...
