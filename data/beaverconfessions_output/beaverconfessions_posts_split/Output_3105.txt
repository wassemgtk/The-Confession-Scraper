Every time I see the portrait of the couple by the 6.01 lab, over near where the TAs meet before class... I swear it looks like their faces were swapped.

I would just stand there during staff meetings going... am I crazy? Does anybody else see this, too? Did some poor hacker do this long ago, and his work has been lost, forgotten, enshrined as memory? Am I overthinking this?

That being said they seem like pretty chill portraitees. :-)
