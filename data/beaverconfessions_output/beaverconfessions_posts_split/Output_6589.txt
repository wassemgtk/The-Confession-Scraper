When I got here as a freshman I had no social skills whatsoever. My parents pretty much locked me up with videos games a kid. Their reasoning was if I was around other kids they would get me hooked on drugs. Had my parents actually done any research on drug addiction they would have learned that social lives generally help people stay sober. So when I got here I couldn't hold a basic conversation with most people unless it was about schoolwork. I remember spending every night crying alone in the shower so my roommate wouldn't hear because I didn't know how to express myself or relate to him. Most people thought I was a lunatic or autistic, or some interesting combination of both. I slowly observed and learned how to do social skills with other people. My first two years here was a long painful series of poor interactions. I remember wanting to shout when people gave me odd looks, "I'm trying to learn how to talk to you, I'm 10 years behind and I have to catch up, can you cut me some slack?!?!" I slowly got better, made friends and even have a girlfriend now. They all actually make a point to help me be aware. So I want to let everyone else out there feeling like they can't learn to be normal with people, you can do it. It's going to hurt and be scary, but I promise with work and determination it gets better.
