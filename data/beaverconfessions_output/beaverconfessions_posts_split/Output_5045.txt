Just got my lowest grade at MIT in what's been by far my easiest class, because the averages on everything were so absurdly high they went with a normal high school 90+=A, 80-89=B, 70-79-C, etc. grading scheme. And the worst part is that I was 1pt away from getting a higher grade. :( 

I know it's not the end of the world and grades aren't everything, but it's super frustrating.
