I hate the fact that people running for positions in the freshmen class thought it would be a good idea to friend people on Facebook in order to get votes. The person I voted for president was the one person who didn't send me a spammy friend request. Some of them even sent more friend requests after I deleted them. I also may or may not have reported their profiles to facebook as spam.
