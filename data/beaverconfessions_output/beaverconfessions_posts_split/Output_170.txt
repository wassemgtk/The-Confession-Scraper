K. So my past came to haunt me, this week.  I was making progress with this chick. Like real progress. I'm sure she was interested in me and I was interested in her. Even though we live many dorms apart and are constantly busy, our connection stayed strong. So I asked her out one day and she initially said yes but cancelled coz she allegedly had something planned that day. I asked her what had come up and she didn't respond.  Said hi to her in a lecture and she responded coldly to me. Turn's out she's in the same sorority as this other girl from my rather recent past - let's call this girl Y. So I liked Y but Y liked someone else - this rather douchey frat boy. So I reacted badly to this so I went agro on her, said some shit I should not have said and, in gen, erred on my part. I should have handled it better. So I tried to recocile things with Y - said sorry in chain texts, tried to chat with her but Y was having none of it. I'm so sure that I weirded her out. Y and I are over as friends,  acquaintances or anything in gen. She's enjoying her life with douchey-bon-douche (I constantly meet Y with bon douche) and well that's good for her. So I moved on, got a new girl in my horizons and never looked back. Unfortunately, girl 1 and Y are friendly to each other. She mentioned me in a sentence and Y told her everything (I verified with girl 1's friends - it's still a miracle how I even got an answer). Dear Y - I know that you were looking out for 1 but I also wanted to move on with a girl I REALLY LOVE. I wouldn't have treated her like I did to you. Fuck you, Y. Fuck you. I really liked her, for God's sake!!
