I want to die... I'm probably never going to kill myself, but it's all just too much right now. I think my friends would say they want to know, but honestly I don't feel that close to anyone and I don't think anyone would want to be friends with me if I burdened them... and honestly I don't have anything to deal with compared to anyone else. So instead I'm just going to be funny. I don't understand why I'm so miserable all of a sudden. I know I should stop whining but I just want to cry.
