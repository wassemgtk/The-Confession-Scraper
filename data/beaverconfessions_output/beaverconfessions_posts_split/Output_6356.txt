I just can't get it right. I feel like I try so hard to be a good student and to prove to myself that I'm smart and capable, but it's so hard to convince myself when I fail almost every test I take. I've come to like myself in most other ways, but I lack confidence in my own intelligence and it's really affecting my overall well-being. I feel like as a junior I should have these things under control by now, but I don't and I don't know how.
