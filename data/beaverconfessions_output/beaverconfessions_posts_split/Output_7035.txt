I've devoted so much time to work this semester that I feel like I haven't spent any time doing the things that I love, and that I don't have time for the people I love. This is really sad for me, because I was really excited about returning to MIT this year and seeing all of my friends again. I compare myself as I am now - working like crazy, catching barely any sleep and just dying - to how happy I was 2 months ago, and it couldn't be more different. Plus my depression is returning and I'm barely making it through the day. I feel like I picked the wrong school because I ultimately believe that life here is meant to be about much more than your profession, and although I have the skills to make it here, I couldn't see a starker contrast between me and those people who enjoy working so much that they make it their lives here. I feel like shit.
