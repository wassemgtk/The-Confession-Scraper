So during the break, my family finally confirmed their worst fear, their daughter is a lesbian. Which was great, because (I hope) the news would just spread, save me some trouble of coming out to everyone. 

But it is so irritating, I am happy in love with my girlfriend, why do they think that it is wrong? I did everything right, went to a good school, got good grade, responsible, etc. Now they are telling me that coming to MIT might have been a mistake, because MIT somehow turned me gay. I really wish they would just understand that I am happy the way I am and there is nothing wrong with that and they can accept me (long shot).
