#4851 Emily Thai I am sorry your G spot is not as sensitive as mine. Truly, different women have different biology. I am not lying when I say it is difficult for me to have a perfectly silent, vaginal (not clitoral) induced orgasm. Maybe it's easy for you but you can't generalize to all females. I was not. I was generalizing to myself lol. I happened to mention that females tend to have louder orgasms. I didn't say this was a hard and fast rule. :)
