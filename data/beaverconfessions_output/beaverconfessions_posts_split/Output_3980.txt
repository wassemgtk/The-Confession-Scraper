I just want to give a huge hug to all my POC classmates that have to deal with all the bullshit that's constantly thrown on this page and all the other microaggressions happening in your daily lives. It sucks being an MIT student and having this burden and not feeling like your peers want to understand, much less support you. Also huge thanks to the students involved with BSU, LCC, ASA, Caribbean Club, NSBE, Spanish House, BWA, Mujeres Latinas, Chocolate City, McCormick 4-West, and all the other organizations/living groups (formal or informal) on campus that work hard to keep spaces inclusive, supportive, and positive for POC students :) Y'all definitely don't get thanked enough. You rock!!
