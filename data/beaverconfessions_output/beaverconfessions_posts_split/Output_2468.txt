Hey, firstly, I have to say I am not affiliated with MIT. I have not even applied due to some circumstances. Well, shit happens. What I wanted to do was to stay in touch with the community or rather meet all of you and because I couldn't do it in person I decided to just read MIT confessions what in a certain sense shows me your struggles and a piece of your student's life. I'm writing this because I cannot understand one thing. You are the most intelligent people in the world and still I have a feeling like our generation, at the MIT either, is a generation of regress. We want to create amazing things but we can't handle talking to other human being. Dildo.io? Seriously? I have to admit that I haven't seen how it works but I guess I can suppose. Men, where are your balls? Just walk over, say hello... We used to complain almost every day though we have everything to lead normal life while others really struggle to survive another day. I know ya all work really hard but you all have the brain and the ability of recognizing whether something is good or bad. Make use of it and stop follow others, find yourself.
