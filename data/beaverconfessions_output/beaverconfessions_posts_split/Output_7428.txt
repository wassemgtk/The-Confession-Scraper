I get really annoyed by my friends sometimes. I mean I think they're wonderful people and I enjoy hanging out with them, but they all have some habits or say certain things that just annoy the crap out of me. My brother thinks I don't have any friends because I complain about them all the time. But really I complain to him so I won't accidentally complain to the actual person. Is it normal to feel this way or am I just a jerk?
