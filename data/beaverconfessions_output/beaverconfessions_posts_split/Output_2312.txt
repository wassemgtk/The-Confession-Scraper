I broke up with my girlfriend back home two weeks ago, and none of my friends here even know that. It's pretty sad when your girlfriend of two year leaves saying she was not feeling the "real thing", but what makes it worse is just the fact that I don't have close friends here to share this and get the load off my chest.
