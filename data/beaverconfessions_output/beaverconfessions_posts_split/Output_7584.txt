recently started asking my bf to try choking me, then tying me up, gagging me and blindfolding me during sex.  He really enjoys it and so do I. I've started watching excessive amounts of bondage porn too.  I've never really judged people based on what they do, alone, with the person or person(s) they feel most comfortable with, and I know that a lot of you don't either, but if you know anything about human psychology, what do you think this says about our states of mind? sometimes I catch myself thinking "wow, this is kind of sick.... why do I find this enjoyable?"
