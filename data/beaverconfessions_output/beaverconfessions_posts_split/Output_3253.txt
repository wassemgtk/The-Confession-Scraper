Every time I take a break to eat, sleep, or take care of myself physically or mentally, I always feel some sense of guilt for wasting time that I could have used studying. This feeling has made me quit some clubs I enjoyed and my UROP. I only did this because the stress of feeling unproductive was making my activities less enjoyable. I traded one stress for another. Now my life has become just schoolwork :(.
