To all the people complaining about how hard MIT is: I'm sorry, but get over it. If MIT weren't this rigorous, it wouldn't have the reputation it does. I say this as someone who is legitimately doing terribly here. But I understand why it is this way, and I made the decision to come here, so I will live with the consequences.
