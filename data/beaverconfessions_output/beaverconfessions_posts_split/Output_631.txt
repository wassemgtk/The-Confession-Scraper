I was practically guaranteed an A in one of my classes but the profs decided it would be fun to write the final based essentially entirely on one of the practice exams (obvs not what we "learned" in class, that would make too much sense) so I ended up with a B. It's really annoying to complain about a B but I'm super salty because I worked my ass off in this class. Fuck you profs and fuck you even more useless TA's.
