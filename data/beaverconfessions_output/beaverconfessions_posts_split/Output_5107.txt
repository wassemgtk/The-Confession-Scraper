Freshman year: Finish all fifteen 18.02 problems, go back, check your work, make sure 2x3=6 because it would suck to get points off for that.

Junior year: Hmm write down 2.005 formula, partial credit there, maybe if I use it wrong, I’ll get some partial credit there… oh and if I write a little note saying I know this wrong, they’ll appreciate the honesty, understand that I know (some) of the material and probably give me some more partial credit.
