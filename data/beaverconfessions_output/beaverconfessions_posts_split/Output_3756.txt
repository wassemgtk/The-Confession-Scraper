Democracy is slavery to the majority--a majority that cares not whether it is right or wrong, only that it is enforced in the name of "fairness."

The democratic aim of equality is directly antagonistic to the aim of quality and a superior people. Through its decentralization of power, democracy absolves political actors of responsibility. A government without responsibility and without a moral leadership is beholden only to monetary interests. These monetary interests are rarely in the best interest of the folk nor the nation's overall wellbeing. Where is the consequence for failure? Where is the failsafe for ill intentions?

The aims of democracy are not a better state of better people. The aims of democracy are an unnatural and irrational faith in a majority and an equality which is impossible by its nature, for in the end, the ruler is money and the power it buys. There is no desire within the elite to change this. It is in the nature of democracy to demonize all which disagrees with it. And yet despite the thick wool pulled over the eyes of a nation, there are still those who see around it to realize that the "greatest system on earth" is nothing but a sock puppet--an abuse of power hurtling toward mediocrity as if it were salvation.
