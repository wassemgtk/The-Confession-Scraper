Well, I guess my social experiment has come to an end. I don't expect you to post this confession, though I certainly hope you do. I am Darryl Williams. Of course, that is not my real name, but I am a real student at MIT.

I created the account to see what would happen if someone were to espouse progressive views on nearly every conservative post, as I see happen so much on liberal posts. This was when I was ten years old - a wee child in the eyes of the giants. "Ah," I would say, "some day I will grow up to be a real, big boy." I tried and tried, and with each new comment on MIT confessions, I grew stronger and stronger. I always vowed not to forget my humble beginnings, but sometimes, you just can't look backward. You have to look forward. You can't even look to the sides, because you are so small and soft that even if you try, your neck will fall apart in an instant. Bam, snap. Cut in two. The result of this experiment is censorship of the MIT confessions page; I had been expecting this for , but somehow it was still a surprise that the page admins could so blatantly have hypothyroidism. To all of the campus conservatives, alt-righters, shitposters, nationalists, redpillers, unite - you have nothing to lose but your chains!
