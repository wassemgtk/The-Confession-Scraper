I don’t know how to seek help or respond when people empathize with me.
Pops died when I was 10 and I grew up learning to do things on my own.
As an eldest son, tradition demanded that I stepped in to fend for my younger ones.
I grew taking take care of others, always putting their needs before mine.

This responsibility made me mature way earlier than my peers. I grew up thinking about
long term consequences of my actions, and how the consequences will affect my family...

Do you know what it fucking means to have been a household head by age 15 tho? The pressure. Good lord. Do you know what it fucking means for people to always come to you with their problems, expecting a miracle? Shit. You have four MIT finals, but just received a call about sending money for grandpa’s funeral...

I’ve been a Lone Ranger for as far as I can recall. It’s brought me the good and the bad.
The good in the sense that it drove me to succeed. The bad in the sense that I find it hard
to connect with people emotionally, and even worse, romantically. Ask my ex.

Not even sure about where I am going with this, but I wanna give a shout out to all the big bros and sisters out there. People don’t give you the credit you deserve, but y’all da real MVPs.
