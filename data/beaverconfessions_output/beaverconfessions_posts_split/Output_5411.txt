I've never gotten a B before in my life. Not before MIT, and not even at MIT. I work hard, but I also realize how fortunate I have a natural ability to do well in school. I may take for granted sometimes my intelligence, but I never forget even for one second that there are other students that work twice as hard as I do and still aren't able to pass classes.

With this in mind, it really bothers me when someone does poorly on a test and when I try to console them or encourage them that they can do better next time, they never take me seriously. They tell me "you couldn't understand, you've never failed a test before in your life". They tell me, "even when you think you've done badly, you still usually beat the average". 

Since when does doing better than other people define whether we're doing well? Why can't I feel as if I've done poorly if I didn't live up to my potential, no matter how far above or below average I was? It's not about doing better than other people, it's about doing better than you think that you can do.

And even more, since when does our grades define the quality of our lives? Just because I've never failed a test doesn't mean that I don't know what it means to fail, to be disappointed in myself, or to face hardships.

I guess I just wish that people would realize that when I say that I know that they can overcome this, and that it will be ok, they're not empty words. I mean every one of them because I've been there too, even if I never show it.
