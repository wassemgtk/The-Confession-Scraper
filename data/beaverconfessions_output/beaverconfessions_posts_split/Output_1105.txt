This confession is not entirely my own.  During CPW, every person I met was like me with high standards and similar values. I had found my people. We had strong, supportive families that valued education and made many sacrifices for it.  Our invitation to MIT meant our years of hard work were finally recognized. Most admissions applications mentioned the strong bonds between MIT parents and students. As an MIT mom, I was the person who always believed my student could succeed even when they doubted themselves. The emotional turbulence at MIT is not limited to students. My confession and that of many MIT moms I know is how painful it is to spend almost two decades giving so much more than the parents around us only to find out that on Motherâ€™s Day our students that we were once so close to, either barely acknowledged us or forgot us altogether.
