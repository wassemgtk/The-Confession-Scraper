20.111 is so fucking disorganized. What's on the syllabus doesn't match what the professors teach, the TA's are ridiculously unhelpful, we never get our psets back and the one exam was a complete shit show for most of the class. On top of everything there are like 25 students so it really shouldn't be that complicated to sort out logistics right? ugh
