Since last semester, there's been this feeling of loneliness in the background, even though I'm surrounded by people -friends and acquaintances- everyday. This is really hard for me to explain, and being in a position of authority makes things more complicated, since I don't want to worry those who see me as their leader. I don't know how long I can keep going with this feeling of loneliness that's constantly in the background.
