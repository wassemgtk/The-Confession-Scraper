I have this really bad habit of eating toilet paper.  I don't know why but I just really like the dry taste on my tongue.  I've been taking all the toilet paper from the bathrooms of my dorm for when I'm stressed out with psets. I haven't told anyone and I hide all the rolls under my bed because I feel like people will judge me.  I've tried to stop but I just can't.
