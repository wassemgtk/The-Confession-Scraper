I'm not going to my sorority's formal even though they keep telling me how fun it will be. Everyone is supposed to bring a date be it a boyfriend, girlfriend, roommate, suitemate, friend, cousin, whoever you want. My sorority already budgeted for everyone to bring a date. Frankly I have no one to ask to come to the formal with me. I'm naturally an introvert and I'm getting really tired of forcing myself out of my comfort zone just to sit at a table alone getting ignored by everyone around me and then when I try to insert myself into conversations and be social I just get pushed out of the conversation as if no one wants me there. My best friend is a pint of ice cream. I give up. I guess it's just going to be another lonely night of anime, junk food, and self-loathing.
