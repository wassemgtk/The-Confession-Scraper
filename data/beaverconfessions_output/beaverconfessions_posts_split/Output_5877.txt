An unhealthy level of stress is one thing. Complaining that you're not having sex, or that you don't feel attractive, when you're studying at one of the most prestigious universities in the entire world, is like the fucking definition of a first world problem. There are billions of human beings on this planet who don't have access to a comfortable living space or a reliable source of food. 

So many people would give up everything they ever had in life to have what you have. Complaining that you'd rather get pussy than study is fucking disgusting.
