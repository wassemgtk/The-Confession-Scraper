How do I meet new people on campus? It seems like all the sorority girls/frat guys/sports teams/etc. all clique up and its hard to get to know anyone anymore...my current friends don't even care enough about me to invite me to do things with them, i have to be the one to reach out and ask until i guess they feel guilty enough to invite me...
