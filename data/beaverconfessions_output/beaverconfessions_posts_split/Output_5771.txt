I was very happy today to find the the department of housing proposed banning smoking in all public housing units in the nation! Of course some libertarian jerk I know whined on fb about it. He argued that is was elitist in telling poor people how to live their lives. Some of my friends tried to shy away from that argument. I prefer not to mince words. Of course we are telling them how to live their lives as middle and upper class people. Poor people have shown time and time again that they do not know which decisions to make in their lives, why do you think they are poor? We aren't doing it to kick them, we are doing it to help them live better. It is our duty as the more fortunate to help those less fortunate, even it involves a little tough love.
