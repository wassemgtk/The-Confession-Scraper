To Burton 3 Bombers:
It is indeed horrible what has been done to your mural in the burton conner dorm, and whomever did it should feel ashamed. Nevertheless, I want to take this event to remind you that you do similar things, and now that you know what it feels to be on the other side of the “prank” you should reflect on your actions. When there are pamphlets in the elevators, you turn them around, and sometimes even write on them. You also continually press the button for the elevator in your floor just for the “fun” of it, and keep the elevator from getting to other floors where there are actually people who need it.You also sometimes have parties not on weekends nor on holidays, and scream SO loud that people can’t sleep nor study for exams. I am just saying, please be more considerate of others. Your actions are as inappropriate and hurtful as the graffiti that was done to your mural.
