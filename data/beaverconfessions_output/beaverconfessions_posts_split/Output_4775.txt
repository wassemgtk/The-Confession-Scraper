@#3610 Racist? As in, I think that race is a real thing, and that each has different characteristics? Yeah, biology supports that. It's not taboo to say black people are generally faster runners, why is it taboo to say that asians are generally faster learners? If that's the charge, then I'm guilty. 

Am I hateful towards other races? No, I actually care about them doing better. I think they need more opportunities and more education, but more welfare and handouts doesn't help them get any better, it will only keep them dependent. Teach a man to fish, don't feed a man a fish.

White activist? Yeah, I'm a white activist. Why? Because Japan, India, China, the Middle East, and Africa are kept culturally and ethnically homogeneous, yet Europe and America are supposed to be "multicultural." We're supposed to feel bad if there's not enough of other races in a certain job or in our country? Why is this? What other countries have these sort of policies? It's absurd. The best person for a job should get the job. At this point, America should accept the best immigrants into our country regardless of nationality. Europe should be allowed to stay white, just as other countries are allowed to remain as their ethnicity. 

For some jobs on average a white person that applies will be better than a black person for that job. Am I supposed to feel bad that the world is this way? Sorry, that's the way the cards were dealt, life isn't fair. Some people are faster than me, some people are smarter, and some people are going to make more money than I am. I'm just going to work hard and try to get ahead as much as I can.

I'm a white activist because I don't think I should hire someone who is worse at a job because of their skin color. Who's the one that's discriminating when you have racial quotas? Take a look in the mirror. Also, if there's a black students association, an asian students association, or a latino students association, why is a white students association bad?

Also, no this isn't just one person. There's more people who agree with this than those who will admit it.
