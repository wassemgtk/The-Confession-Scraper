In elementary school I used to argue with my teacher about the pattern question on every standardized test. Consider the following pattern:

circle, square, triangle, circle, square, ____

What’s the next shape? You say it’s a triangle? Bullshit. I argue that it can be circle or a square, or a fucking watermelon. After that, repeat through that sequence of 6 and you have your goddamn pattern. I’m a trendsetter, not a follower. 

Now I’m at MIT.
