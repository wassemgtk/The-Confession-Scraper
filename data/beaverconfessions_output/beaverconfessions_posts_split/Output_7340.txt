When people say "I will be here for you!" to a depressed person, they literally never mean it.  Depression doesn't just go away after a few days people.  "Being there" may sound like a romantic concept at the time (it will be just like the movies, a best friend holding a best friend's hand as they go through a tough night) but it may encompass a year of watching them slowly make strides and slip and fall.  It's been a little over a year for me.  

And just when I started to think I trust you, you pulled the rug.  I don't blame you though.  Everyone can only take so much.
