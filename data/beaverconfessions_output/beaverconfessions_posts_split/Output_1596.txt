"Farris said that holding the discussions next year, rather than immediately, is intended to show consideration for students who are currently working on projects and preparing for finals week." 

So instead we get a vaguely worded email that our home is probably being demolished with no answers available during the last week of classes. The only thing worse than telling people their home is being taken away during an already stressful part of the semester is telling people their home is likely being taken away, but that they'll have to wait 4-5 months for any subsequent information to come as the result of these "discussions." Worry away, everyone! There's nothing you can do. 

I stood by the fact that DSL was doing the best it could in good faith with a shitty situation during the Hyatt move period, but now I'm convinced they don't actually give a fuck about the undergraduates.
