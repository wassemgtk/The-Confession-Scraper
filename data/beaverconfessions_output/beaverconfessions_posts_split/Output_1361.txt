I have this tendency to write down my thoughts once they get to a point where they become all I can think about.  It helps calm me down.  I found a note I wrote six months ago where I wanted to tell you about how your eyes seem to encapsulate galaxies, how your cheeks are the product of an artists dream, and how your smile is without a doubt my favorite phenomenon to behold out of anything the universe could produce.  I miss that small amount of time I believed you and I could have been.
