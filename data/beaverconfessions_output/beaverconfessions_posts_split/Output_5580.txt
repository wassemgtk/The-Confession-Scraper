The chief reason I fill out the EECS workload surveys: Professor Goldwasser's emails are so good.

WEEK 3:
Although I am not fond of repeating myself,  I will repeat myself next week. All in a good cause.

WEEK 5:
In order to maintain your interest, we have composed the following piece:
 
Roses are red
Violets are blue
Fill out the survey
or no cash for you

WEEK 6:
Blah blah blah fill out the survey. 

WEEK 7:
All that is necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men and women to not fill out surveys.
-Edmund Burke, paraphrased

Week 8:
I have heard from some students that they are too busy to fill out these surveys.

Week 10:
It's 3am...I hope you (at least) are asleep. Life can be beautiful after a good night sleep. Your energy is restored, your memory strengthened, and you can think more clearly and creatively.  

Week 11:
Did you know that every Thanksgiving, the President of the United States is given the choice of two turkeys, and that he pardons one turkey and eats the other?
 
Perhaps in addition to a presidential pardon for turkeys, we should have a professorial pardon for students.
We won't know whether that's a good idea unless you fill out this week's survey!
