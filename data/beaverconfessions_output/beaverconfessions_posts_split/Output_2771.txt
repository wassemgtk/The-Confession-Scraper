I really don't want to start another race bating argument here, but could someone with knowledge on the topic just briefly explain and everyone else keep your pseudo-racist opinions to yourself: Why doesn't affirmative action merely correct for income and applications are race-blind? My understanding is that affirmative action was made because POC's are statistically more likely to come from lesser-privileged homes and therefore should be given a slight advantage when it comes to university applications. So to eliminate all the backlash from A.A. why can't they just not look at race and scale acceptances with income? That way they give equal weight to all races and all income levels.

Again please no anger, I just want a quick "here's why that won't work" from someone that is more informed than I.
