theres this one kid who continuously posts racist stuff on Facebook, outstandingly racist, like not even disputable racist. (if he read the definition of bigot it might be hard for him to turn away as a person who hates or refuses to accept the members of a particular group (such as a racial or religious group))

i cant help but think the kid just needs to make more friends, since he came from a town that was all but 3% white. i had a professor tell me once he was once like this kid, came from a rural town where everyone was white, and he changed after having a roommate who was a gay black male during his time in college, and learning about him. i hope it's really true that people can change this way, and that they just need to be exposed to more people with different experiences. 

i know that was my experience when it came to certain issues, i was able to see that problems and national issues are not so dichotomous as we would like to perceive, though it certainly would make decisions easier, that people don't all have the same experience or circumstances when it comes to facing problems, and ultimately i changed my views.
