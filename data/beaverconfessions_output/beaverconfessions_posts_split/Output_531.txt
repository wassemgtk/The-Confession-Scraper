Why has it suddenly become okay to assume that if Person A accused Person B of raping them, Person B must be guilty? When did "guilty until proven innocent" become okay when it comes to sexual assault? I know that for some people, it takes a lot of courage and time before they're ready to report the incident, and that the probability of the offender being convicted decreases as time goes by. And I know that it can be difficult to prove "beyond a reasonable doubt" that the assault did take place. But now we live in a world where if I, as a guy, say all this, I'm a misogynist who doesn't want to take the word of a woman who says she was raped.
Does this really make any sense, guys? Do you realize how fucked it is to skew your judgment this much for a particular crime? Does it really make sense to arraign/convict someone of sexual assault just because someone who may or may not have actually been a victim says so?
