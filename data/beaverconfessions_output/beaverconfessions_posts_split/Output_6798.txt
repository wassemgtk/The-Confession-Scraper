It's the end of my freshman year, and I still feel like I haven't found a group of people I could see myself remaining friends with for years and years. I feel like college is where I'm supposed to be having the time of my life, meeting my best friends for eternity, but I'm really not. 

I don't even know how to describe it. I have friends I can talk to, and I have friends I can work with. But besides stress and science, I do not know anyone who gives a fuck about the things that I care about or whose sense of humor I instantly click with...not to say that I'm not incredibly grateful for the friends I have, but it seems like we can only spend so long in a room together before we get tired of each other. People listen to you if you make noise, but then when you're done crying, you go back to your separate lives and psets. I guess this is why people get into relationships--to have someone else who is emotionally invested in your life. But there never seems to be enough time for a relationship here at MIT. 

I hope no one else feels this lonely right now, but if you do, know that you are not alone. I pray that it gets better from here.
