In light of Monday being Pi day... here's a little anecdote for those students who will soon be nervously refreshing their browser in anticipation of their admissions result.

March 14, 2014 was the day my dreams were shattered.

Somehow, my strict Asian parents had raised me with the notion that the four years between entering high school and leaving it were specially allocated to lead up to this judgement, this day, when MIT would deem me worthy or unworthy of their campus. I absorbed the worldview they imposed on me, and I developed a burning obsession with MIT. The thought of getting that golden ticket, only reserved for the select few, meant so much in my mind - parental approval, societal approval, financial stability, and all the other good things you are raised to value in an Asian household. If you're a current high schooler who can 'get' what I'm saying on a near-spiritual level, keep reading - I have some advice specifically for you.

I'm assuming if you identify with what I have described, you know how important parental approval can be in your life. You don't even know why, but somehow it is. When I opened that MIT admissions result, my immediate thought was not "My dreams are crushed!" They were "My parents will hate me!" If you're in the same situation as I was, this will happen to you too. I guarantee it. Then quickly more thoughts will pile up. "What if I don't get in anywhere?" Your stomach sinks and your abdomen feels empty. "What if I never get a decent job?" "This can only be bad for my life." A rejection can mess with your emotions in an irrational way no matter what, and people will tell you not to think these things. But you can't help it, that's how emotions work. I will go out on a limb here and tell you: it's okay to think these things. You're coping. It's natural, and don't let anyone make you feel bad for being so upset over a "first world problem" like getting into MIT. It's a very real problem to you, and it just hurts more when people try to dismiss it.

Over the next couple of days the salt is fresh in your blood as you open google and type "rejected from MIT collegeconfidential" since you know you can only find comfort and empathy online, not in your parents. Your parents are disappointed, even mad at you, for not getting in. It really is as bad as you thought it will be.

A week later you're functioning okay, but your abdomen is still empty. (This is starting to sound like the recovery timeline for a romantic breakup, isn't it?) You're insanely jealous of other students who "made it" and you start to wonder what it was all for.

About a month later, you're back to normal, but you can't help but wonder why you were inadequate. You still feel like you're less of a human being than your soon-to-be-MIT-freshmen peers.

About two months later, you start to take a step back. You develop a new philosophy of self that does not involve MIT, and you start to see that there's a broader meaning to things than just where you go to college.

I am going to a well-known but not highly US-News ranked school right now, and I am satisfied with how things have turned out. I'm not going say some cheesy turnaround like "My rejection from MIT was actually the best thing to happen in my life!!", but rather I want to inform you that things will work out for you personally no matter what, even if your parents remain disappointed in you a year later.

So for all you Asianlets with strict, MIT-pushy parents out there, know that the first weeks will be tough. Know that the two months to follow will be a natural process of coping. But after those two months you will have yourself back on your feet, with a healthier sense of self than the admissions result first left you with. If you end up in my shoes, look back to this timeline to keep yourself grounded and make sense of your emotions. I'm rooting for you the whole way.
