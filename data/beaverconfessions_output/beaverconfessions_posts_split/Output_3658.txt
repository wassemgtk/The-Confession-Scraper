I've seen a lot of negative posts about S^3 lately and found that even despite my multiple positive interactions with the office that I am now nervous about using them again. I can only imagine what it feels like to read those stories never having stepped into S^3. 

While I don't want to dismiss people's horrifyingly negative experiences with certain deans, I wanted to share one of mine that typifies my interactions with S^3. About two weeks ago was the first anniversary of a friend's death. For about two days, I bounced from one friends room to another just trying to keep my spirits up. I didn't try to do any work because I knew I didn't have it in me to do it. Unfortunately, I was already looking at a hell week.

I went to S^3 walk in hours and met with Dean Feller. I briefly explained what was bothering me and told her that I needed two or three deadlines pushed back a week. She had me email my professors and cc her. When a prof requested S^3, support she quickly replied to back me up. 

I've used S^3 a couple other times to the same effect. It saddens me to see that some people have not been so lucky, but I wanted to provide a positive story so hopefully people don't completely rule it out as a resource.
