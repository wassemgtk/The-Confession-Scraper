At the end of high school when I was deciding whether to go to MIT or a school where I got a full ride, I found something an MIT grad wrote:
"MIT is a place students hate, but alumni miss dearly"
I'm not saying that I hate MIT at all, but I thought it was interesting especially when I'm trying to study for finals.
