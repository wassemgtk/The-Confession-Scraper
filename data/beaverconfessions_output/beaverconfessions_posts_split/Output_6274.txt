i'm afraid i've ruined my life by foolishly thinking i could be a whore without any consequences. i don't know if it's possible to find true love now without somehow hiding my past. despite all the feminism double-speak, i've been hearing that guys just don't respect promiscuous women. i need some clarity. please help.
