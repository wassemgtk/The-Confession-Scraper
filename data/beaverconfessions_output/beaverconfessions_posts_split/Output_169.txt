Dear #8269, [trigger warning]
I remember the first time I ever cut myself. I was 15, a sophomore in high school. I kept doing it, off and on, through the rest of high school, through freshman year at MIT, through my medical withdrawal, and even after my readmission. I'm not sure if I'm in a position to help, since I still struggle with controlling my urge to self-harm, but I felt like I had to say something. I'm sorry that I am anonymously posting this so I can't tell you to reach out to me. This isn't a story I'm ready to have connected with my name on a public website.
Like some comments said, it's not that your friends don't care, it's that they don't know what to say. I had friends that actively tried to get me to stop, but it was only a handful of them, after I'd admitted it to them first. Most don't know what to say beyond "you really shouldn't be doing that" but you know that already, even if you don't believe it.
Others simply don't notice. For people who don't self-harm, it's not the first thought that comes to mind when they see cuts and scars. Without sounding abrasive, realistically, how many bodies/arms do you actively look at every day?
I thought I was strong enough to keep it under control. I thought I could stop at one cut. I wasn't. One day, I escalated. I had over 50 cuts on my arm when I was admitted to the hospital. Looking back, I know I could've died.
Please, seek help. Go to MIT Medical. Open up to your friends. Tell your GRTs. Then, they'll know to watch out for it, and they'll know to support you. Don't expect them to read your mind and your body. Doing that will only add to the cycle of bad thoughts that eat at your self-worth.
Love,
Someone who's felt that way before
