@ #5613, I like to think I'm the one your post was directed towards. If so, it was just that the situation hurt me for a few days thereafter, not you. To this day, I still think you're one of the fucking coolest and most thoughtful people I've met here. Given the conversations we had, I feel you had good reasons to make the decision you made and, thus, I'm happy you went through with it.

If I'm not the one in that post, @myAnon the aforementioned things still hold true, but I just don't understand that silence which came between us :/
