I don't think I'm good enough to be here. I'm behind in a class I really care about, and the professor just emailed me to ask why I've missed so many lectures...I'm tired all the time, physically and mentally, and there are days where I just hole myself up in my room and try to finish the piled-up work I have. How do people even have time for things like HackMIT and TechX projects? As much as I want to make cool projects, I'm already weighed down so much by my classes.

I wish I could catch a break, but weekends have turned into workdays too. As soon as I finish one pset, the next one is due tomorrow. I don't have time to breathe, but everyone around me seems to be chugging along just fine...

Definitely not good enough.
