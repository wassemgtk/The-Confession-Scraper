Dear Ellena Popova,

 Your compassion for others really amazes me. I sometimes wish I was you, being awesome at literally everything - I mean your EMT work, your research... how do you do it? I am both jealous and astounded. You may know me, since we talk every now and again but not really.. I wish we could become closer and develop more of a relationship because you are a truly singular person and although now you experience this through pain someday that very same pain will be useful to you because anything or anyone worth their space was forged through adversity.
