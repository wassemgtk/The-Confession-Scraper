I finally got a threesome going last weekend. I had tried for a while, but finally got it. The odd thing was, it wasn't as good as I expected. The realization came at the end where the girl asked me to cum in her mouth. I obliged and them she started making out with the other guy swapping the cum back and forth between their mouths. Then it dawned on me, I'm not bi, I'm just plain gay.
