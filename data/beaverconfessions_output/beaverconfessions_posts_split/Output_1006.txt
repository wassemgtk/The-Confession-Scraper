I want to give a huge fucking shout-out to Professor Martin Culpepper. Despite initially being one of the most intimidating  people I've ever met, he's turned out to be one of the most persistently caring faculty I've had at MIT (although I still regularly shit my pants when I'm in a meeting with him.)

I was having lots of trouble with my 2.72 team project due to depression, and he allowed for me to work on an individual project. And even when I had trouble with this project as well, he's been nothing but patient. Once, he even allowed me to just sit in his office and work on the project while he worked on his own stuff, and let me ask really dumb questions if I needed too.

He's the sort of engineer/teacher I aspire to be in the future. I'd highly recommend taking his class if you can.
