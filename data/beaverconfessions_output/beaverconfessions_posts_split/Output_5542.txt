To: #2883 Since coming to MIT, I never made a serious effort to join a club or community. I thought the friends that I had were enough. But now that I'm almost done with MIT, and these friends have their own clubs and communities to be a part of, they never have time to hangout with me. It's very lonely being me and its been solely my fault. So join a community everyone, or else you'll end up crying in your room cuz you have no-one at MIT like me..

Please reach me! I want to talk to you!! Send an email to iwannatalktoyou2883@gmail.com
