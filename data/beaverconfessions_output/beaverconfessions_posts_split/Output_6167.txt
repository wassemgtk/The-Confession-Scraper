I have a serious issue with the engineering majors here, or any school for that matter. You do realize that that isn't the only difficult major in college and that every single person studies their ass off and has their own issues? I don't understand why you think you're doing something much heavier than the rest of us! Every person here decided on their own terms what they find challenging and what they find interesting and they pursued it and that's life. If we were all to do engineering nothing would ever get sold, advertised or written about. You might be good in a certain field but every field is important in order to get the entire system, we cannot just rely on your coding skills to make this world better. Granted, it is challenging and I know personally there are many who study late nights and have a lot of coursework. But I also know of people in other schools who have a tough time too, but we don't go make fun of others? You guys need to respect other peoples struggles and their choices. You chose this life, we could've too if we really enjoyed it but we enjoy other things in life! Just stop.
