To all the freshmen freaking out over grades this term: from freshmen spring to sophomore fall, I brought my GPA up 1.3 points. So don't panic if things didn't go how you hoped this term. Your GPA is still super flexible at this point and you can learn from this term and kill it next year! And you are still the same brilliant, competent person you were a year ago, even if your grades are different from what you are used to.
