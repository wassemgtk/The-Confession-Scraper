Being offended is subjective; it has everything to do with you as an individual, as a collective or group or society or a community, your moral conditioning and your religious beliefs.  What offends me may not offend you and you want to make rules or laws about not offending people?  Grow up.  I've been offended many times but I don't go crying to anyone. I explain like a human being why something offends me and why I take offense.  You start a dialogue.  You try to understand why that person said it and their experiences that lead them to say that.  Everyone's experiences are unique and so is each person's interpretation.  I happen to hold an unpopular view albeit valid and was shaped by my experiences.  Your response to me that I violate your safe-space and that I should leave even though we are on public property which no one owns and which no one can claim as a place for something other than use by all of the public was guaranteed by no form or branch of government nor is it implied anywhere in law.  The law, I would argue, says quite the opposite about having different ideas.  I have no problem with taking offense with something.  I am offended by people who defend Nazis or people who take stereotypes as facts.  When I hear them speak or interact with them in public, I don't claim safe-space and try to kick them out of a public space.  I would rather ask them why they hold such views and challenge them to think about the facts we know, find common ground and make my argument to why they are wrong.  If that person still refuses to change their opinion, my view will be that they're just a dick and there are human beings like that, unfortunately.  However, I don't tell them to leave a public space.  If I came there out of my own volition then I can leave.  I do not have a right to not be offended but I do have the right to give that person a very different point of view and I also do have the right to stop having the conversation and leave.  Perhaps you have been so scarred that you can't control your emotions? I don't know but I was sad that you didn't want to hear what I had to say.  May be it's too hard for you to talk about it? I'll never know.  Oh and perhaps next time don't start a conversation with a stranger if you are going to tell him to "Fuck off" and take offense to what s/he had to say.  You'll do everyone else a favor. Thanks.
