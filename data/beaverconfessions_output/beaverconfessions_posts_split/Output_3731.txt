In all honesty, redefining terms like "racism" into prejudice plus power or whatever else suits your own narrative is incredibly hypocritical when you then claim to have the moral superiority in an argument. Yes, from your viewpoint you are fighting for something you believe in and that's fine, but claiming that you are on the right side of an issue that, again according to you, has only two absolutes is annoying and incredibly insulting when you consider that that warped definition of racism didn't exist 5-6 years ago tbh smh fam
