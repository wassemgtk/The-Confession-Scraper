The people who are freaking out over Trevor's post need to stop publicly shaming him. He is one of the nicest people on this campus. If you had truly wanted to "educate him on your experience" (which most of you claimed was your goal) you should have messaged him directly and explained how you felt to him privately. Publicly shaming him on Facebook is totally unnecessary. He clearly didn't mean any harm so I think everyone needs to calm down.
