I feel guilty that my boyfriend cares about me, instead of about someone who is in greater need of that care and affection. I found out yesterday that the girl he used to date in high school had physically abusive parents (abusive to each other and their kids) and I feel like he should have stayed with her, even though he broke up with her (because of distance) long before I met him. But surely she deserved someone who is loving and affectionate more than I do, given that situation.  I felt sufficiently guilty after finding this out that I couldn't sleep last night and therefore barely made it through an 8:30am class.
