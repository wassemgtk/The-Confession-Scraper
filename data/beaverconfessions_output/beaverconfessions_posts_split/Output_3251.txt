Whenever I googled "MIT ____" (where ____ is a person or thing that may or may not be typically associated with MIT), I would always wonder why I'd get a metric shitton of random results in German. Then I realized "mit" actually means "with" in German. Try it yourself - google "MIT hot dog"... or "MIT iPhone Apple"
