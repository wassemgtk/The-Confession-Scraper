I didn't mean to cause you emotional abuse. I'm so incredibly sorry. This sounds lame and cliched, but I wasn't acting like myself. I'm really doing better now. How can I fix this? The last thing I ever wanted was to hurt a friend. Sometimes people really don't deserve second chances, i sincerely hope this isn't one of those times.
