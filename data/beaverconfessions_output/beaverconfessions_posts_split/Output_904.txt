Honest question--why do many (not all) vegans put that they are vegan in their social media descriptions? Do they feel like what they eat is part of what defines them? I can understand that sometimes diets are a reflection of religious beliefs, which is something people use to define themselves, but I've never seen someone put 'halal' or 'kosher' in their social media descriptions.
