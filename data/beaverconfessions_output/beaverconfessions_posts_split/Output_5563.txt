I used to be a strong believer of the fact that "rejecting someone because of a general lack of attraction to their particular race" is by no means "racism". I felt terrible that I was selectively dating/hooking up with women who were of my race only and ignoring others, and was in fact branded "racist" once by a woman to whom I explicitly confessed that I rejected her only because of her race. So recently, out of curiosity, I decided to give in and hooked up with an individual who was of a race I was never attracted to. No matter how much I tried, my cock refused to erect itself in any damn axis and during no second of the whole encounter did I feel sexually aroused. Am I still racist then for my selectivity despite my involuntary hormonal response?
