I see a lot of people talking about how MIT has given them a lot of opportunities that they wouldn't have had somewhere else, to apply their skills or get better at things. I don't feel this way. I've been struggling so hard with classes that I don't ever feel like I have the time to do other things, lest I fail in academics. Does anyone else feel this way? Does anyone who has felt this way have advice for how to "do more"?
