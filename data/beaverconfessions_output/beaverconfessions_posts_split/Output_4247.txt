I am an introvert who acts very extraverted when I don't know anyone. So I was really social when I first got here, but I slowly feel myself pulling farther and farther away, and spending more and more time alone while all my friends are growing closer and closer. I feel so conflicted. I want deep friendships, but I don't want to see anyone or talk to anyone. But I feel like if I even take a weekend to myself, I am going to fall behind and all my friends are going to move on without me until I am just a distant memory. I don't know what to do. And everyone here seems so close already, as if they have been friends for life, but I KNOW they just met within the year. I was friends with the people back home for eight years now. How am I supposed to be able to have that level of friendship with someone I just met?
