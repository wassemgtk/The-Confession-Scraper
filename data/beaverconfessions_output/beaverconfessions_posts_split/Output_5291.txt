So I brought this girl to fraternity's formal and used the venue as a chance to get to know her better. We were friends before, but never close. I'm at the point where I don't know if I want to date her. Not because I wouldn't date her, but because I don't know if I want a relationship. The existential crisis going on in my head lately has been interesting.
