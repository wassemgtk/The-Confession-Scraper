Is MIT Mental Health free? Is it possible to go anonymously? I'm really not feeling well, but I'm also low on cash. Will they contact my insurance company? (insurance is through my parents and I don't want anything going back to them). I also want to be anonymous because, as an MIT person, it's not ridiculous to imagine that I may want some high level government clearance at some point, and showing a lack of mental stability may count against me. Even if MIT Medical can't report it due to patient protection stuff, I would imagine the NSA has ways of getting at that data. Can I go to MIT Mental Health anonymously?
