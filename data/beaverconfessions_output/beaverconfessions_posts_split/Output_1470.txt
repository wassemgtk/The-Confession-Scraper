This academic year has been one of the worst periods of my life, and so many times i wanted nothing more than to just talk to you. Tell me, when did i brush /you/ off? When did i refuse to listen? When did i hesitate? But still, you were never there for me. Some best friend you were. I dont know why i still miss you.
