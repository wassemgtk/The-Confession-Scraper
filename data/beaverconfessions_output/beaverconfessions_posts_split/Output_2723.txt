For the first time since my first breakup, I made out with someone last night. And now I'm happy and buzzing, and I never imagined I'd feel so glad :). I had honestly expected myself to feel clingy and unproductive after the makeouts, but I mostly just feel happy and motivated.

Also, shout out to dildo.io for encouraging an open dialog about things like this. Not sure it would have happened otherwise.
