I'm a broken ass man. I really appreciate it when ppl try to help me but they don't know. Like damn. And it's not even that bad anymore. 

I thought I would grow out of feeling like shit all the time but I didn't even grow out of whining about it. This shit just comes and goes in waves. 

Fuuuuuuck I'm so done

See you in a few days when I'm feeling better
