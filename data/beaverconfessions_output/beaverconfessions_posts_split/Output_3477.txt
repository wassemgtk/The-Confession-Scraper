@4536 and 4873: I did a double-take when I read your posts, because for a second I thought maybe I had written them myself. Know that there's someone else feeling pretty much exactly what you expressed: completely unmotivated to do work; apathetic, lethargic, and sad for no apparent reason; and confused about this unfamiliar but persistent feeling. I'm starting to compare myself to my ridiculously motivated and accomplished peers and feel inadequate, despite knowing that comparing is subjective and unproductive, and that others may look on me the same way.
