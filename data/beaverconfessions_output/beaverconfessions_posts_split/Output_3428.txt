Here's what I have to say about Lean On Me:

Do the technical parts of it work quickly and efficiently? Yup, got a response within 15 minutes, had a long conversation with the volunteer. Is it well intentioned? Of course! Was it actually helpful? Well...

However, I can't shake the feeling that the volunteer who I chatted with was a caring, well-intentioned person, but they seemed a little canned, a lot more sympathy than empathy. I told them about struggling to find any willpower to wake up from my bed everyday, and how much I hated myself for not being able to do work. They gave me gems of advice like, "maybe it will be better and less intimidating if you break up your work into smaller pieces!"

I told them that while this advice was correct and sound, it still wasn't *helpful.* I told them that they were doing good work by being a volunteer for this, but that they didn't really understand the level of despair I was going through. After a bit of a pause, they told me that I should probs go to Medical again, and didn't say much else.

Should I expect that the volunteers have a deep understanding of what it means to be ridden with depression and anxiety? It's probably not fair, but I was hoping that the support would feel more genuine, and less like it was out of a pamphlet.

And that's the general impression I get of Lean On Me, both its creators and its volunteers: well-intentioned, but a bit shallow. Hopefully others have had different experiences, but my interaction didn't offer much beyond the sea of information about campus mental health that we're constantly bombarded by.
