I think there are only 2-3 people here who actually care about me. I thought there was one other, but I was wrong. And the number seems to be getting smaller. I have other friends, but that deeper connection isn't there. I'm starting to wonder if it's that I haven't found my niche yet or it's me. I have so much love onto give but it seems like no one deserves it, or wants it
