As a man involved in the feminist movement I want to call out some hypocrisies I have personally witnessed. Certain feminists want equal rights but also want men to be expected to hold the door for them and pay for them on dates. That is not equality. If you really want equality then you don't get doors held for you by men for being a woman or meals paid for, you can't have it both ways.
