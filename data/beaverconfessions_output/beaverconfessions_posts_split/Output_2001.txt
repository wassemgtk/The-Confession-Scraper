Am I the only one that's noticed that whenever there's a DJ playing EDM and people aren't really dancing there's an Asian guy that decides to show off his mad breakdancing skizzelz? And regardless of who it is, it's always the same routine. So I guess my question is, do you guys plan this? Like is there a schedule of who should show up to where??
