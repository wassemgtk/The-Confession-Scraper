There's this girl I'm really into who I'm close friends with but she's one of those girls who's just really friendly  and stuff so even though she's touchy I don't think she's into me. I don't really want to risk losing our friendship or making things weird by trying to date her. I really want her to stop teasing or whatever and make things clear somehow but I guess she just can't read how I feel like I can't read her :(
