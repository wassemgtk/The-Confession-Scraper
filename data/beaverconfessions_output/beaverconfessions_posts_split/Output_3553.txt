In the midst of one of my shittiest weeks here at MIT the likes of which would make Murphy proud cause it would definitively prove his theory to be up there with those that govern our entire universe, where I don't even know which friends I can turn to, and where I find myself writing a run on sentence here on MIT Confessions, a professor just brightened my day. Professors get a bad rep cause they're the face we can blame you know psets, tests, etc. On but they really care, and not even just within the context of you doing well in their course. This professor I am taking about was the only person this entire week who sensed something was wrong with me and asked if I was okay and also sent me a very encouraging email spontaneously and just yeah I'm in the stud right now holding back tears because it's nice to be reminded there's light in the world when everything else is dark, even if it's just the eye of the storm and shit will get bad again in the near future (read tmrw) but yeah just a shout out to everyone who cares, including professors, random ppl in the infinite, and ofc dogs (cats care too but they like to play it cool/hard to get)
