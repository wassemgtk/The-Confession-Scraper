My older bro told me two things before I started college, four years ago: 1. Don't date during the first semester (i.e. Hookup.) 2. Don't become too attached to the girl u date during college. I broke both of the 'rules'. I loved her, spent so much time with her and dated her since day 1. I saw a future with her only for her to send me a breakup message yesterday. I got burned. Bro, you're much wiser than I am. I love u and should've followed your advice.
