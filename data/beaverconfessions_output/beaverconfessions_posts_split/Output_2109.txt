The CI-H requirement is such bullshit if you come into MIT with basic English essay capabilities. Two in a row now, two different departments, and it's the same story: spend hours of your life writing 10-page papers, but make sure to not get too creative or too advanced in your argument! Stick to X exact format and don't tweak the thesis we pre-wrote for you in the prompt too much!
