What do you do when you realize you're not the person you thought you were? It had always been my dream to get into MIT and I thought it truly suited me. However, I realize now that I like arts more than I like studying mathematics. I'm too afraid to give up, but I know that I'll be miserable if I stay here. I admit it, I like imagining myself as a mathematician sometime in the future, but I know it will never make me happy..I just want it to make me happy
