I've been hearing a lot about transgender people and non binary people. I have no problem with this. But if you decide to go in drag or get the surgery, please stop complaining about the stares and teasing. People are going to do it, they're people. It's human instinct to fear and retaliate against differences. Conformity has its group purposes.
