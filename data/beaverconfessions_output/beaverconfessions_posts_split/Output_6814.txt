Over winter break I got into an argument with my conservative Vietnamese first-generation mother about feminism. I couldn't understand why she was so willing to prostrate herself to my abusive dad. We had a cool-down period, and when I found her in the kitchen I kind of got fired up again.

"The kitchen is where the patriarchy thinks women belong, you know."

Ma paused in dicing the spring onions, letting their pungent airs water my eyes and nose as she stared at me for a long time, her strong gaze hiding her weariness from the day's work. "There's nothing wrong being in the kitchen," she said, "you wouldn't be alive if I were not here." She resumed cutting, and I realized the onions had nothing to do with my tears.
