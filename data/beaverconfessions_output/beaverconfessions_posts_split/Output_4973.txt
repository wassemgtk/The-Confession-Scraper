Because no matter how many times I say it in person the same group of people don't get it:

- Lounge walls AREN'T soundproof, there are rooms on the other side
- Talking/yelling loudly at 3 am so that you're louder than your friends doesn't in fact make me think you have a large penis
- If I can clearly hear your music at 7:30 through the sound of a shower, two doors, and a hallway's distance, then you can probably hear it through the shower 5 feet away. 
- If somebody walks outside in their pajamas from a dark room and asks if you could be quieter, they probably don't just mean for the next 5 minutes before you get loud again. 

Please people. Other people exist and are tired of getting out of their bed in the middle of the night to remind you of these things.
