I was really happy that I got my top choice for senior week, but after talking to other people who didn't get so lucky in the lottery I'm very disappointed in the senior week committee's ability to run a fair lottery. So far, I have talked to people that got 2 of their last choices, someone who didn't get anything at all, others who got 3-4 of their top choices that happened to be unpopular, and still others who got 2-3 of their top choices that were extremely popular. And then there's people like me who got only one option that was ranked as their first choice. 
I'm happy with what I got, I just think it is extremely unfair that there is a person who didn't get anything at all when there was an elite minority that got 2-3 of their top choices that were also extremely popular. It's also an odd coincidence that many of these people are in the committee/friends with the committee members. 
I know there was corruption last year with friends of the committee getting their top choices, but at least the 2015s made sure that everyone got something (so far that I know). This is unacceptable. And I know the committee is going to try to cover their asses and say it's fair but at the end of the day it is what it is. 

I hope they gave that person something in the end.
