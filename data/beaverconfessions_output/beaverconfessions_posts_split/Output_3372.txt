To all the prefrosh coming for CPW:
Congrats you got in!
MIT is one of the greatest places to be on earth. You're going to love it here. We can't wait to have you all here for the weekend. 

However, fair warning: you will doubt yourself often here. You'll think you're not good enough. You'll have small breakdowns frequently because the stress is overwhelming. That's when you'll truly know the meaning of IHTFP. 

Have hope though! Know that you'll be here for a reason. You're meant to be here. Don't let stress overtake you. Embrace TFP.
