I've never loved my big so so so much. From the very first anonymous email, I knew. I have never felt a stronger bond to another human being in my entire life. She is the being whose every step, every breath, and every glance I must dutifully worship until the day I die. When I finally speak to her, it will be as if our angelic voices make love in the space before us, and create a microverse of energy.
