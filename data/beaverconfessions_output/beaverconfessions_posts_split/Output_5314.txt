That feel when the "female-friendly" pornstar you masturbated to for years is accused of rape by many women who worked with or dated him.
I already have an intense worry of boundaries being crossed while feeling powerless.  No alcohol before hookups.  And too many times I've paused a situation progressing fast instead of just relaxing and going with it, in the worry that he could hurt me and I'd feel like I was too far in to say no.
Even with men well versed about consent. Kind, intelligent friends and confidants.  I thought I was being overly paranoid and overly empathic for imagining myself in the shoes of survivors I know. I so instinctually fear rape.  And it seems, rightly so.
