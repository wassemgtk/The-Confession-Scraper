My heart aches for you. I believe that you are a good person. I believe that you have a good heart. I believe in you. But nothing I do can make you believe in yourself. I am not the only one who cares. You are not alone. Stick with it. Every day is an opportunity to get better. And I'll be here with you every step of the way. If only I weren't such a coward to say this to your face.
