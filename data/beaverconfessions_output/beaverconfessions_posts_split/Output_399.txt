So I'm pretty sure that this guy that I met  a few weeks ago is gay, and I really like him. We usually see each other at least once a day but I don't know why I can't hold a proper conversation with him, and most of the time we only say hi to each other and that's all. What can I do to stop being so akward? If you are reading this, please talk to me; my feelings are true but my social skills are a failure.
