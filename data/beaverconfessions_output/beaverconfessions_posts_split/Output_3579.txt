To all the seniors who will soon be gone: Thank you. Thank you for your kindness and your late-night math lectures, for your hilarious stories and for the shoulders that I've cried on. You guys are the reason I love this place as much as I do. I wish that you would just stay....

But since that can't happen, I wish that, when I am a senior, I can be to those far-off future freshmen what you all are to me.
