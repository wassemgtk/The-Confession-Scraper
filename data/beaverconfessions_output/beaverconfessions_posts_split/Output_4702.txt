I hate Valentine's Day. I've never had a significant other. And I don't really have any friends. I don't see why anyone would actually want to be with me. I'm fat and awkward and dorky. It's just another reminder that I am and will always be the third wheel. It makes me feel (more so than other days of the year) that I'm just going to end up dying alone. I just hope I live in an apartment at the time so that I'll actually get buried when someone smells my decaying corpse through the wall.
