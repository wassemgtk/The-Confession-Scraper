I wanted to share this article because I think it would add some good perspective to some discussions I've seen here. I'm slightly conservative-leaning myself (at least on economic issues) but I try not to let that stop me from reading other opinions (in fact the person who wrote this is pretty liberal but I'm an avid reader of his columns). When conservative views are expressed here whoever holds them is basically labeled as an idiot by those two/three people that comment all the time. I think you guys sometimes should give some more charity to views you don't agree with, and perhaps you may even change your mind (happens to me all the time). Enjoy! http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/08/opinion/sunday/a-confession-of-liberal-intolerance.html?emc=edit_nk_20160506&nl=nickkristof&nlid=73150179&te=1&_r=0
