I thought I was a happy and optimistic person, but during the past few weeks I've been rejected by many companies, bombed several tests, and gotten ignored by people. I feel like nothing good has happened to me lately. I'm really scared that if my bad luck continues, I'll end up doing something I regret, like self-harm or worse.
