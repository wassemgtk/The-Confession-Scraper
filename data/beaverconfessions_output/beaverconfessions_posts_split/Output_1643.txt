I literally (like 3 times) keep bumping into the guy in the wheelchair that works in the Stud Center.  He's always nice about it and even made a joke that he is going to charge me an Uber fee.  I always wonder if he's single, or gets mad girls.  I'm kinda bi curious...maybe I have a wheelchair fetish, damn.
