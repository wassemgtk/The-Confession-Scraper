I did an internship at an accounting firm last summer. My mind was blown. The legal scams people get away with is insane. This one I want to call out because a lot of activists here are being taken advantage of. We helped solar and wind companies. Did you know that most of them lose money yet still make a profit? The way they do that is tax breaks for them actually pay them money if they get a loss on paper. So they sell or even give away power to get a loss. They then claim they are cheaper then fossil fuels but if they charged prices to meet their real costs would go out of business. And then we the taxpayers foot the bill. These owners could not care less about the planet. They are using us green activists as pawns to get a government subsidized failing business. do to my fellow greens here let's call them out and push congress to change the tax code so they have to do honest work.
