I'm a typical guy, fitting into the dominant end of the personality spectrum.

Over time I developed a thing for crossdressing (in private) and being submissive sexually.  It let's me explore a part of me that's totally different from who I am. It lets me be someone else, forget about the exams and psets.  It's some (fun) escapism.

By the way, fellow dudes, try out a skirt sometime, even if in private.  That shit is comfy as fuck.  Society needs to progress to the point where I can wear a skirt and for it to be totally normal.  That would be awesome. :)
