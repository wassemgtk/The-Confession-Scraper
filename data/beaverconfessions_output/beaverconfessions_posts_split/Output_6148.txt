I totally feel hopeless these days. Why does this world just give undergrads so, so, so, so, so little tolerance to make mistakes?
I feel we need to be nearly perfect in such a competitive world to survive, everyone around me are all way too talented with either a 4.9 or 5.0 GPA. I am so confused. Isn't undergrad education suppose to provide us with opportunities to explore and try different things, and to learn through mistakes? I don't know when. When? The situation has changed as if we need to be perfect. Nearly perfect, 4.7+ GPA, decent research experience, probably publishing papers as an undergrad, and recommendation letters, and working experiences, and language ability.......I feel it's impossible for me to survive here. Why? Why is this world so stringent to undergrads, to people who just start their 20s? Why aren't they not allowed to make mistakes? Conversely, you need to excel all the classes, get only 2 or 3 Bs, and function as a grad student in labs, in order to get into grad schools. Why? Why is the world so tough?

I am entirely miserable about my current situation, probably I am just a useless person that doesn't deserve to appear here, or even this way too competitive world. I don't understand. I actually enjoy most of the classes I am taking. Although most of them are demanding, requiring heavy readings-several papers or hundreds of pages of literature in advance, I feel I learn a lot. I also learn a lot in class and do my best on assignments. Occasionally, things just turn out to be imperfect. I got a score close to average on a midterm, and then suffered from nightmares that I could get a B on that class, which is a CIM with 18 credits that will totally make my GPA collapse. I can hardly sleep and eat well these days. I also got points off on daily homeworks, but I am so confused. Why? I have made my most effort to study and do the assignments, they just can't be perfect, perfect in a way that meet some specific, abstract given "key worlds". And the class is just graded in such a stupid way. You have to be exceptional to get an A. You have to be brilliant to get an A. You have to be "more excellent" to get an A. Why? I don't understand. Why are instructors in MIT always so reluctant to give As as if they had to pay for each given A? In my classes, everyone, or at least 90% of people work very hard on presentations, labs and reports. What's the point then to choose the top 1/3 of them to give As? Why do you need to be 10 points higher than average each time in order to get A? Not even one failure is allowed, otherwise you fuck up, collapse, and lose. I don't know why. I actually like the classes. I learn a lot. I like the professors. I just can't agree with this whole world. Fuck the world. The world makes me to do so. But I have to pretend as if I could power through every class, even afraid to post in my native language here lest being recognized. Fuck myself. Fuck this world.
