I don't know how to do things anymore. Really, I can hardly get anything done. Ever. I have 5 missing assignments. Each of which I managed to get 25%-50% of the way through before their due dates. I have extensions on all of them --(the emails alone took me 4 days to write/send)-- but... how am i... actually... going... to do this... by the end of this week? I don't know what I'm doing. I'm not doing anything. I can't do this. Nothing gets done. *flush*
