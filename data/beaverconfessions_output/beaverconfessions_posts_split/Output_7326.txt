Ever since I got into MIT, a lot of neighbors and family friends have been constantly bothering my parents by asking them how I got into MIT. After my parents tell them my SAT scores, my activities, and my awards, they always say something like, "That's all? I know a lot of people who did better than that and got rejected." 

To tell the truth, I'm a pretty average girl who worked really hard and got really lucky. I'm really grateful to be at MIT, but I feel really bad about all the people who accomplished more than me and didn't get in. I kind of feel like the only reason I got in is because I'm a girl.
