am "that antisocial person" who no one ever sees. I hate psetting and studying with other people. For one I need absolute quiet to be able to focus, and worse, I feel enormous pressure not to ask questions or be slower than other people in the group, especially since I am usually a minority in my classes. I can't tell if I am less intelligent than everyone else or they just hide it better (and I fear that I am making excuses for myself by considering the latter), but I am missing out on too many social opportunities because of this. Next semester I will work much harder to keep up with the coursework so I can get over this problem and have a grasp of the material before going to the study groups.
