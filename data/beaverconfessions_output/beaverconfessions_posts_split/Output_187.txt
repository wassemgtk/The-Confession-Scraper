I'm so jealous of my friends who have stable family lives. A lot of them tell me to stop complaining because they're independent and they know what it's like to rely on themselves, but they really really don't. They still have something of a safety net. I've seen them have it-- when they got sick, their parents sent them soup. When they wanted to buy their brass rats, they got loans from their parents. When their boyfriend/girlfriends broke their hearts, they talked it through with their parents. I mean, like I'm happy they're independent and have grown out of needing their family, but I never got to grow out of needing my family. I took care of my parents, not really the other way around, and it bums me out sometimes. 

I'd give anything to know what it's like to call your mom at the end of the day and talk about school and life and the cute guy that I'm crushing on in my morning class, and to have the conversation end in an "I love you, no matter what anyone tells you, you're doing great." 

I really really try not to feel sorry for myself because it's useless, and most of the time I'm really happy with my life (cuz like shit, I'm at MIT) but goddamn, am I jealous sometimes.
