What is with people loudly talking during lecture? I understand if you have a question about what the professor wrote on the board, just whisper or wait until the end of class. But why do some people insist on loudly talking about non-class related things during class?! Not only are you distracting the other students in the class, you're being extremely rude to the professor. I pay a lot of money to sit in this class, it'd be awesome if you would shut the fuck up so I can hear what's going on. And if I ask you nicely to be quiet don't give me attitude back. People these day smh.
