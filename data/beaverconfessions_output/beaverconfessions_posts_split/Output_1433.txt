I had a chance with a girl and I blew it. The worst part is, I would be so good for her. I know it. If only she gave me a better chance and got to know me better. But I don't know how to be single and I didn't play "the game" right. Maybe I was too clingy. Maybe I was too distant. Too loud. Too quiet. Too annoying. Too boring. Who knows. 

Every night I think about all the things I want to tell her. If only I had the guts. 

If anything, I would just want to know where I went wrong so I do something different next time and to prevent be alone forever.
