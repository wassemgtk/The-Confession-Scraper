I study hard, really hard. I pour my heart and soul into those psets, practice exams, and lecture notes. I go to class, recitations, office hours. I sleep and eat relatively well. I'm generally optimistic and passionate about my classes and major. 
However, I failed three exams in a row, and I can't identify the problem, and so I can't come up with a solution to fix this problem. Do I need to sleep an hour a day and turn into a mentally unstable psyco in order to survive? 

So fuck this place. Fuck you MIT. Fuck you for 1) Killing my passion 2) Trying to convince me that I'm stupid. I'm not. 3) Destroying my hopes for grad school  4) Destroying my dreams in general 5) (irrelevant to academics) Putting my registration on hold every goddamn semester for 'late' payments even though my parents pay the entire mother-fucking tuition every fucking semester. Fucking bastards.
