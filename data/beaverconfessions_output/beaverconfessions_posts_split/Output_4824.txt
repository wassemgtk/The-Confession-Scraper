To the person that was wondering how to tell a guy that they loved him.  I don't know if this is a romantic relationship but I wanted to tell you my "I love you" story.

I had been in a few relationships (some of them platonic) where the other person said "I love you" and I felt compelled to say it back.  It made me feel dirty, because those three words mean a lot to me and I felt like I was being pressured into saying it back to people.  Anyway, so I promised myself I wouldn't pressure anyone into saying it back.  So when I started dating my boyfriend, I didn't want to be the first person to say it.  I slowly realized that I loved him and I left him little hints.  I would write him good morning notes (when my classes started before his and I had to leave him sleeping in bed) and sign them "Love, ****."  About a year into our relationship, I told him outright that whenever he was ready, he could say it.  (Our relationship had progressed to such a point that we were pretty forthright with one another but I didn't feel comfortable saying, "I love you," and only getting an "okay that's cool" in return).  About six months later (a whole 1.5 years into dating), he sent me an email saying that he loved me and all of the things he loved about me.  It was the sweetest email ever!  (I like to read it again every now and then).  And about 6 months later (2 years into our relationship), I woke up and he looked at me, kissed me on the forehead and said, "I love you." (It was the first time I heard him say it.)  He rolled back over and I proceeded to squeal with happiness.  (And of course, I told him that I loved him too.)
Anyway, it took a long time.  I really had to be patient but when he said it completely out of the blue, it meant a lot.  I don't know if this is helpful, but I just wanted to let you know that there are other people out there who are patiently waiting for these three words as well.  And our stories may be long (2 years for us) but some of them have happy endings.
