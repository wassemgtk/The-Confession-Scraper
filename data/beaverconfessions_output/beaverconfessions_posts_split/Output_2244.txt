I don't like MIT. I went to school here -- "went" because I'm about to graduate. I am tired. Stuck in a perpetual dysthymia. Always hoping my family will save me from my emotions. I love MIT but I will not linger here. No Senior Week for me -- going straight home. Work some, play some -- not work hard, play hard. I wish you good Engineers farewell. You were good classmates. Adieu.
