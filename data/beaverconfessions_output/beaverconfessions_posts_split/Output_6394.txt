I'm really starting to get irritated by how hard the institute has been pubbing the Apple events on campus this week. I've gotten over a dozen emails from various groups advertising the same events, and it just reinforces the whole stereotype of how circle-jerky Apple fans are. Yes, their design is marvelous, and yes they're coming to campus, but I don't see why Apple should get so much more publicity than any other company of equivalent caliber that comes to MIT's campus.
