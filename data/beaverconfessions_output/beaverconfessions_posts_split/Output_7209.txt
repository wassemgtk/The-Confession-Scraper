You told me we were exclusive. Then you secretly slept with other guys. And now you're mad that I asked you to stop? Don't accuse me of "perpetuating rape culture" and "not respecting feminist ideals" when there was an explicit monagamous understanding between us from the beginning. Feminism is about empowerment, equality, and respect - you just use it as a ticket to justify cheating. That kind of bullshit is the reason why no one has any idea what feminism actually stands for.
