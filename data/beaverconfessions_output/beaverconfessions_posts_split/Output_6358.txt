Coming into MIT as a freshman, I was cynical and bitter, and all the upperclassmen thought there was something wrong with me.  But MIT made me better because it was finally a place I had people who didn't hate my company.  I finally had solid friend group I could rely on.

Nowadays, I find myself feeling that I'm that friend that nobody likes but no one is willing to confront.  I can't help but wonder if I would be happier if people were willing to tell me they dislike me to my face.  I get that they're being nice, but the fake and teeth-clenched kindness sucks too.
