If you're ever seriously considering suicide, try drugs. No, not just antidepressants. 

I'm not saying use them liberally or experiment on yourself, but they can give you another perspective to knock you out of a nihilistic funk, make you more confident, or help you feel accepted and loved by other people.

They saved my life. Remember that there are always options to solve whatever it is you're going through.
