@5893 Posts like yours make me pity you. So many awkward dudebros come to MIT expecting the typical college experienceâ„¢ of getting laid and coasting through school. Then they get sad, fail their classes, and complain about culture. You came here to learn. So did I. I spend not one second of my day worrying about what girls think of me because my shit is none of their fuckin' business. Get a better sense of priorities, your life will change for the better.
