I do not get the whole Missouri college president resignation incident. I honestly don't. Here's the facts, a few rednecks in a pickup truck with a confederate flag who didn't know Missouri was a union state said some mean things to a couple black people. A white man also said some other mean things to black people. And then this is somehow the university presidents fault? He met with the black student group, and had a couple disagreements but agreed to some requests, and that was inexcusable? How can a university president make every student on campus get along? This whole thing seems blown out of proportion to me.
