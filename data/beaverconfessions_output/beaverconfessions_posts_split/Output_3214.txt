As a white guy born in America, I hate myself for not being born Asian. Every day, I come in contact with students from mostly Chinese and Korean background and the more I find out about their upbringing, the more I get intimidated and ashamed whenever they demonstrate how much better and smarter they are. 

I never had to work hard (until I got here, of course) . My competition in high school was sparse, and all my peers were lazy slackers and braindead American idiots. My teachers didn't care enough to hold me to real standards. My parents indulged me with distractions, constant praise, and instant gratification. I got to MIT and I realized I've become this useless pleasure-seeker because I was raised by entitled, complacent Westerners.

All the Asians I know were raised to be focused and quick witted. They're more motivated. They have many more years of practice and infinitely more discipline. They look out for their own. Their brains are better wired for symbolic patterns and memory as most of them are bilingual. Their ancestors didn't commit disgusting crimes against humanity like mine. Their culture is the best in the world. I was raised all wrong and I'm guilty about how inferior I must appear to these people. Just fuck my life up. 

Asians will inherit the world.
