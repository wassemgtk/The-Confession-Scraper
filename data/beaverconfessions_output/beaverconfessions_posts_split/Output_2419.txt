@5949 It sounds like your bff thinks your bf is a mind reader, and it sounds like your other friend thinks women aren't allowed to change their minds. Both are wrong. The second person is wrong in a really gross and creepy way.

It's okay to make a decision and realize later it wasn't the best one for you. You are allowed to have feelings, even if no one has wronged you. And in the future, if you figure out you don't want to be doing something, you're allowed to stop it.
