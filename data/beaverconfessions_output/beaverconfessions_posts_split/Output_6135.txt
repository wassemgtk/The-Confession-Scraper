i'm semi addicted to an obscure stimulant called 2-FA and rely on it to get by with both work and in some cases my social life. i feel it's like cheating the system because i can feel amazing while doing even the most boring work, but i dont know if i could make it here without it, and im not even sure what its doing to my long term health..
