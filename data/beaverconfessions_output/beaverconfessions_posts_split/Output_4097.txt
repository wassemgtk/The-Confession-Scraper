When people find out I'm supporting Trump, they immediately ask if I'm trolling or literally retarded and actually get angry when they realize I'm serious. In reality I'm a middle class minority that leans conservative on economic policy, ambivalent on social policy, and is tired of the status quo. For a place that prides itself on being a haven for open minded thought it's pretty hard to disagree in here.
