I'm so tired of people fat shaming me. I hear you going, "oink oink" as I pass, or saying to your friends, "he's got bigger tits then my girlfriend." I know I'm fat and I'm okay with it. I don't get this whole get out and walk fad, it's silly. I would rather die over a nice plate of linguine with Alfredo sauce then running a marathon to prove I can do it. Besides who wants to live to get old anyway, science has great medicine now to ease the effects. Being fat shouldn't be discouraged in my opinion.
