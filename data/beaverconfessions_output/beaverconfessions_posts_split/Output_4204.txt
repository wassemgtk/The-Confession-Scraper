The Tech is a laughably awful newspaper. 

One: your stories suck. I had thought there was hope with what you guys wrote about this past month, but I re-read the articles I thought were worthwhile and they really have no interesing information. For example, with your latest SHAC article, if you follow MIT Confessions at all (which you do reference in your article, so I assume you do), you'll know that people are dying to figure out why SHAC was so in the shadows. Your headline mentions the word "transparency" and yet your article does nothing to address that. You write and I quote, "Despite the lack of transparency that the students on MIT Confessions perceived, SHAC members said in a statement that they were permitted to share contents of their discussions with their constituencies. They explained that they had discussed their ideas by leading “a series of campus conversations to understand the role of residential life in the MIT experience and to discover what the campus’ overarching goals for the future of residential life are.”

As if that really addresses any of our concerns. If those "campus conversations" really cleared up anything, people wouldn't be so up in arms now (did anyone even KNOW about these conversations?). I can't tell if your just bad reporters or if SHAC really just didn't want to talk, but your article is misleading and boring (what a click bait headline!). I mean the first quesion on dissions.mit.edu about SHAC is something like "why does SHAC think there was an air of secrecy" percieved by the students?" Why couldn't you ask something like that? That is what we all seem to care about, not the bland and concillatory quotes you give from "SHAC's statement". I wish you had done a better job. I am dissapointed. 

Second: No one likes working with you, so just stop trying. I am a senior and I have rarely heard anyone say good things about The Tech in all my years being here. I'm not sure what youre doing wrong, but you're obviously doing something wrong. I've heard from  friends in clubs and theater groups that they don't like you. They don't like it when you email them asking to intrude upon their practices/events just to take pictures or write an article. According to my friends in student government, they are told to not talk to the tech because they don't like you or don't trust you, and you should just stop asking them for inerviews: THEY DON'T WANT TO TALK TO YOU. Serioulsy, here's a newsflash for you : THEY DON'T WANT TO TALK TO YOU. These might just be the things I've heard, but I think that they are common feelings. 

Does anyone even read your newspaper? Because it seems like campus consensus is that it is pretty much only good for tourist souvenirs .
