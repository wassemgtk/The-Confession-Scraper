I walked in to a floormate really drunk and talking to my prefrosh. A friend and I both thought they were talking loudly, really slowly, and making my prefrosh uncomfortable while misunderstanding most things we said. This really angers me but I feel like given the hallmate's past actions they won't really change or see anything wrong with this... I just wanna move elsewhere even more now
