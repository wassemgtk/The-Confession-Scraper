Break was the first chance I had to go to MIT Medical to check something out that was bothering me. Turns out I have a possible breast cancer that needs to be biopsied. If it's malignant, I don't know what I will do. I can't think of anything other than that right now. I really wanted a break, but I guess I don't get one.
