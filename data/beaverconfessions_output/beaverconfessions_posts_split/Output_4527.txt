I graduated a year ago and am now in the real world. I remember worrying about some people who said that this was as good as it gets and the real world sucks, and this was the best years of our lives. I can say now don't listen to those voices. What I've learned from the real world is that people who think this is as good as it gets are people who have no desire to do anything with their lives. All they want to do is the bare minimum effort, while having as much time to go out drinking and partying every single night. For people who want to make career, start a family, pursue true happiness, the real world is wonderful place.
