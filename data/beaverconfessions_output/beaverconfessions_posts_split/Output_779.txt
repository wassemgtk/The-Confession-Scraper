This year has been so fucking hard personally that tonight I wished ghosts and spirits were real to keep me company and replace my 'friends', all of whom disappeared the moment I needed their help. People over psets? Yeah right, keep telling yourself that if it helps you sleep at night. My 'friends' have been shitty so I ask of everyone: if your friend seems to be in need of help, don't stay away because you don't know what to do - that's slightly selfish. Be there for them. I hope no one goes through the things I've been through and no one has 'friends' like the ones I did.
