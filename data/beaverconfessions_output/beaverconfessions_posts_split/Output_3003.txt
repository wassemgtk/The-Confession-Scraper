It is absolutely absurd that we have classes and psets and tests over CPW. We are doing a huge portion of the work of recruiting for MIT; there are a lot of students who literally would not be here right now if they hadn't come to CPW. Unfortunately, we are still bombarded with work the entire time. And the people who are most committed to making CPW great, who put in the most time and effort to help MIT, are the ones hurt the hardest. Students are forced into positions where they would have to literally miss class and skip psets in order to be able to run events, tours, and other parts of CPW. And when put in that position, those students often DO IT, because they love MIT and they care more about sharing that love with the prefrosh than they do about doing well in their classes. I think it's terrible how MIT repays them.
