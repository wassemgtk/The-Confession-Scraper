there is so many conflicting information about promiscuous women. i am confused and uncertain. previously i thought slut-shaming was ridiculous, and actively attempted to empower myself by sleeping with a bunch of random dudes, but i am starting to sense the error in my ways. i love someone who won't take me seriously--i think it has to do with my level of whoring, but i'm not sure. it kills me to think i've ruined my chances of true love by buying into the feminist myth that women can be promiscuous without consequences. at the same time--i certainly take responsibility for my lack of restraint and responsible moral imperative. i don't go to MIT, but i bang a lot of dudes who are students there. you guys are smart: please tell me your thoughts...
