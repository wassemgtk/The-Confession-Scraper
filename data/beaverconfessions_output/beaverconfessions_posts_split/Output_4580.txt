The issue with modern day social justice techniques:
I can't tell what is being asked of me.
I feel like things are more relatable if you ask for some well-defined goal to be met. For example, wanting women to have the right to vote. That is a goal with clear metrics and observable change. It is immediately understood if the goal is met or not.
Now, a lot of the talk I am exposed to seems so abstract. I hear more about a passionate "we will overcome this" mindset than I hear about what metrics are being used. I think, for the sake of everyone, it is better to at least define some goals, even if they are a proxy for what is actually desired. I understand things are complex... But I will only ever live within my own set of experiences, so the more relatable and understandable your problems are to me, the more I will naturally support your side. I feel hesitation and uncertainty when I try to support something that sounds abstract and purely subjective.
By the way, I actually think this approach will gain a larger and more diverse following. Instead of focusing on limiting and scolding others for certain actions, focus on asking for a logical, desirable change. I understand it may feel like you are catering to the whims of the privileged with this method, but I believe the mutual understanding and support that can be achieved is more than worth it. The other abstract arguments may follow, but only after spearheading the campaign with clear metrics.
