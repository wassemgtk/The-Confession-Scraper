To whomever put the "STOP HAVING LOUD SEX!" post-it note on my door:
1. So rude.
2. I don't really understand how you can hear my voice from the floor below.
3. I am sorry my orgasms are loud, but as a female this tends to be the case.
4. I am sorry you do not also experience multiple orgasms during intercourse. It's pretty fucking wonderful. If you did, I think you'd understand the gravity of what you are asking of me.
5. I think you might be a masochist who believes women shouldn't enjoy sex, so you can go fuck yourself.
6. My bf takes the note as a testament to his skill lol.
7. No thanks :)
