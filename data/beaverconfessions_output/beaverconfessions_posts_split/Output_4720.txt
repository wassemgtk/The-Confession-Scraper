I've never felt so bad for someone as I did yesterday when our 7.013 straight up rejected the Logs' serenade like 3 times. 

Logs: "EXCUSE ME PROFESSOR WE HAVE A MESSAGE OF LOV-"
Prof: "No. Sorry. Get out. I'm tight on time. Come at the end of class"
Logs: "But professor, it'll only take a minute"
Prof: "I am sorry. I can't afford to waste time. I have material to get through"
Logs: "Well do you mind if we take the student out in the hall to serenade"
Prof: "No. Bye."
Logs: *Sullenly leave*

Me: "Holy shit."
