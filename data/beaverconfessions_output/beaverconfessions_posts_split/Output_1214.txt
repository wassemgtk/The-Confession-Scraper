I know one of the people who's been writing about their heartbreak. He's a great guy - 5.0 gpa and has a lot more good stuff going for him. Unfortunately, the girl he loved didn't love him back. He's devastated and in a bad place. I wanted to advise him to go to a professional like one of my friends at another school did. Then I remembered how bad MIT's Mental Health Dept is.
