here's a chick on my floor and she really can't sing but she think she can.  So she sings all the time.  I can barely study in my own room when she's around.
Sometimes, people on my floor will get so mad that they will ask me to go tell her to stop.  But she seems to happy doing it.  But she's annoying a few people.  Idk what to do.
