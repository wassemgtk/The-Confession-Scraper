I troll tumblr feminists for two reasons:

1. It's really funny how serious these people are. I think it's funny to laugh at the ultra-privileged middle-class white college girls claiming to know "oppression".
2. The humor is the only place I can bury my sadness so that I can survive day to day, because I hate being male so much.
