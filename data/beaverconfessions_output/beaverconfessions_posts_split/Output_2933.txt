#simplyme(7)

It all just happened recently... I'm still heartbroken & it's going to take time, for me to get myself back as I was before all of this happened... Oooh! I forgot to tell you right now I'm so messy, twisty & also hurt, but besides all this I still have to keep smiling & be happy about what happened. That's the reason I want my old self back who didn't seem to care & was happy with myself. I'm back. Call me pathetic but I just tried myself to get him back. Lousy! :-( Love is really stupid. And for him (A)I used to think him with the start of the day till the end of the day. He was always on my mind. (I guess he will is) By the way I used to talk about him on messenger daily. He's still a bit flirty & when he used to flirt with me I used to be on cloud 9. I always thought of him as my lover boy though we're just friends now. But he kept on calling me his future wife. Who wouldn't be amazed with that? I was liking and falling for him more and more. 
1st of April (the day I decided to leave) at around 10:35 I blocked him. I went into shock and after an hour of crying I realised everything. I was all teary. I'll be alright, I know. I wish him everything. I'm happy for him, (??) really happy with all my heart. (well shattered heart) I want to be happy and wish success for myself. People may see me as strong but I am weak inside. ?? I want to move on but tell me how can I stop not to unblock him everytime I miss him. I don't want my family & friends thinking of what happened to me & for sure can't give any idea of what's happening with me... God only can remove me out of my misery. ?? See what it had led me to... I'm today writing my heart out, hoping it will lessen the burden on my heart & help me move on. But why did it happen? What did I do to deserve this? No one can imagine what torches I am going through each and everyday of my life.... 'smiling' when all I want to do is cry. And today, here I'm Lonely:as always. 
P.S. 
 A, 
I'M SORRY OK? I'M SORRY FOR NOT BEING A PERFECT GIRLFRIEND. SORRY FOR NOT GIVING WHAT YOU WANT. I STILL BELIEVE ON WHAT WE CALL MORALITY. AND I HATE THE IDEA OF SENDING YOU NUDE PICS. I NEVER TRIED THAT & NEVER IN MY WILDEST DREAM TO DO THAT. CIAO!
