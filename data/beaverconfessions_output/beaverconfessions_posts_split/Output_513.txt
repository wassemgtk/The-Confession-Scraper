I am actually glad that the bullet didn't miss Harambe. What if that was your own child? What would you do if he/she was in the hands of an unpredictable gorilla? Gorillas are known to attack humans if they feel threatened and there was sufficient evidence from Harambe's behavior that he was agitated by the onlookers and was violent with the poor child, and there is absolutely no guarantee the child would have been safe by the end of the ordeal. Killing the animal rather than sedating it with a dart was probably not the best idea, but given the situation (and the likelihood that darts do not always work), and the extreme risk to that child's life it was totally justified.
