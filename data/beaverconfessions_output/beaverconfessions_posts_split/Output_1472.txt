When i was trying to explain that i dont really understand the 'best friends' thing, it was in effort to say that i really dont understand. I saw you as one of my best friends, but i didnt think you thought the same of me. Now looking at the two of you (and i love your freindship and am glad youve found the friend you were looking for), it's clear that was never us. I kind of hope that maybe one day ill have that kind of love in my life, too. But in its self affirming way, life again reminds me that that's probably an 'other people' thing.
