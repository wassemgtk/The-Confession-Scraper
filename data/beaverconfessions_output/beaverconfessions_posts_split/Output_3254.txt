Saying yes to MIT has been the worst decision I have made in my life so far. It is true that you can say "it will get better" or "you're just not doing it right." Being here just makes me feel sick. It isn't the workload. It isn't staying up until 3 in the morning to be on the bad side of the bell curve. It isn't anything I can put my finger on exactly. I just am out of touch with myself. I don't feel the same. I don't like myself anymore. I used to be able to rationalize the pain through having some redeeming qualities. This lifestyle isn't for me and I don't want to be here anymore. I just want to go home and work at the grocery store down the street for the rest of my life. I don't do anything I enjoy anymore. Pretty much nothing. I don't have genuine friends anymore. I have people that want things from me. Maybe it's always been like that and I'm just picking up on that now, but either way it's a shitty way to be. I won't enjoy my major. I'm not interested in anything like other people here. I no longer find enjoyment in solving problems. I don't have that feeling of accomplishment you get after something "clicks" in your head. I only have my thoughts. I'm going to finish. All I have is the prospect of making my parents proud of me. You don't care. You will never know who I am and I will just be another kid. That's life I guess.
