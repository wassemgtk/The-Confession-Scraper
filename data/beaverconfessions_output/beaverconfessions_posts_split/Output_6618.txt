I've been involved with the feminist movement since high school, we've been trying to challenge much of society. But one thorn has always stood in the way. I have tried to bring up the issue of rap music. Some of it is okay, but the feminist movement has as a whole turned a blind eye towards its openly misogynistic lyrics and attitudes. I tried to bring it up in my high school group once, and was told flat out that because it is a black art form, criticizing it in any way was racist. Criticizing Ludacris for saying he has, "hoes in different area codes" is not a critique of the color of his skin, it's a critique of his character and work. I've seen some great feminists on this campus. Please make a point to call out rap music, it has been allowed to get away with too much. If it's okay to call out frat boys for "No means yes, and yes means anal", then rappers are going right with them. Nobody should get a free pass for sexism. That's true equality.
