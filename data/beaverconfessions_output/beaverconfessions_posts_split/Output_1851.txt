I really really really hate the Saferide sometimes. Like, we're MIT, can we not get a reliable shuttle service instead of the shit we have now. I just really hate it when the tracker isn't active, and then I try calling the Saferide office, and I get sent straight to voicemail. Seriously? I've spent so much money on Ubers already because of shitty shuttle service. And don't tell me I can just walk back home, especially when it's 3am. Someone please do something about this.
