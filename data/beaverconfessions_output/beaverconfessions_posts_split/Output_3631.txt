I feel like kind of an asshole for how lazy I am as a grader. Most of the students spend so much time making sure their pset is formatted super well and they explain every step they're doing, but I just skip over all that and look to see if they have the right answer, and only investigate any further if their answer is wrong. And if the problem is something that wasn't covered when I took the class, I just give them full credit if their answer even slightly resembles the answer in the solution key. The students definitely benefit from my half-assed approach in terms of their grade, but I just think about how much time they're wasting writing out explanations for each step of their work that no one will ever even read. In a perfect world I'd love to read through everything and give insightful comments, but when I have my own work to do and I'm only being paid for 15 minutes of grading per pset, that's just not going to happen.

So I guess for the students whose psets I grade: sorry you're wasting your time doing work I never actually read, but also you're welcome for me giving you full credit for some work that I would probably realize is incorrect if I actually read it.
