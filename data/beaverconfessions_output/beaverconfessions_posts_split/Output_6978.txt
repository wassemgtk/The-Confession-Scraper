Dear Dodecahedron Dude:
Your lamp is really cool. It's always there in your window, emitting a soft, welcoming glow. My whole floor loves to watch your lamp. We also, mostly incidentally, watch you.
You might consider buying some blinds. We saw you on Halloween night ;) Maybe buy two thin ones, so you can block the view to your bed without blocking our view of your sexy, sexy dodecahedron.
