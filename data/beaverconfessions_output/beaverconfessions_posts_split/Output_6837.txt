The tragedy that happened the other day has been weighing on me, much more so than when this type of thing has happened before. I started dealing with depression and self loathing about a year ago, though I've only been honest with myself about it for a much shorter time.

I think what's different about this tragedy for me is that it no longer seems unattached and distant from my life. I don't know everything Matthew was going through, but I know how impossible it can seem to balance horribly difficult academics with family issues, self loathing, and loneliness in the mix. To lose Matthew like this feels like a bitter blow to everyone battling their personal demons, because there's no reason this may not have been me or any of us. 

Please pay attention to one another. I don't care who you are; we aren't so different. We all need support and love and positivity wherever we can get it.

Rest in peace Matthew
