I didn't think it was possible for my mental health to get any worse, and yet its 5 am on a Monday and I'm drunk, with a pile of work to do yet unable to focus on anything but an endless reel of scenarios in which I kill myself playing out in my head. I don't know how to talk to anyone anymore. I feel like every time I try to share anything I drive the person I'm talking to farther away, and usually it's someone I care about and want to be close to. I want help. I don't want to feel like this. But every time I try to reach out something gets fucked and I feel as bad as I did before, if not worse.
