When I tell people (of all genders) I'm a Clinton supporter they claim that if she wasn't a woman I wouldn't be voting for her. Oh right, my entire vote as a woman is based on one single characteristic that I identify with and of course has nothing at all to do with the issues. Using that logic, wouldn't I be a just as enthusiastic Bernie supporter because I'm Jewish??
