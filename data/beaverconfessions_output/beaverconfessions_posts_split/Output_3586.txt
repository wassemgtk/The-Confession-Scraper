So let's see what we've got: the country is burning down. Clinton can't do anything about it. She's in a jail cell, where she belongs. Bernie is trying to put out the fire by breaking apart the elite fire squads and letting everyone else pitch in a hand. Rubio's too mesmerized by the foam from the hydrants to realize he's dead. Kasich is looking at the fire saying "golly gee!!! Wow! How about that! Aw shucks! I did this in Ohio! I did this in Washington! Can't everyone stop yelling?" Trump's rallying a group of working class Americans to combat the rioters who started the fire in the first place. The media is attempting to stop him by claiming he started the fire himself! Cruz is holding down fort in Kansas and Texas and seceding from the Union. He is starting a new country. The Bible Belt. RIP America.
