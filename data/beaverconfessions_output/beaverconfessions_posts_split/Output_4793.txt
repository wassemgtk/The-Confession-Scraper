I'm in a long-distance relationship right now, but it's hard remembering how it feels to physically be with that person, and easy to think it's better off being single when we're apart.  I want to be with her so badly, I see a future with her but I don't know how we'll make it in the short-term.  If we break up I'm afraid I won't find another relationship as fulfilling and I'll lose the one for me.  How do we make it work?
