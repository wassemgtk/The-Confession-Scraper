When I was a kid I was never allowed to play outside without an adult. I wasnt allowed to walk to school alone until I was a teenager despite living three blocks away. My parents watched documentaries on kidnapped kids all the time and I would watch too. Then I came here and for the first time in my life had to study and work and live without an adult telling me what to do. I was frightened to tears. I'm a junior now and I'm glad I had to learn those things. I began asking questions such as what is the danger of a stranger kidnapping a child in a white suburban neighborhood? The answer is almost none. I regret not experiencing childhood as a child. I ask everyone here when you have kids please don't instill unrealistic fears in them. And let your kids try simple things like walking to school or a park alone.
