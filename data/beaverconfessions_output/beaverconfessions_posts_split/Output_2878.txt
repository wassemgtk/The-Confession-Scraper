Damn, so due to CPW I started getting really nostalgic about my high school glory days and decided to see how my boys KevJumba and NigaHiga were doing. Turns out KevJumba has literally dropped off the face of the world to spread the Hare Krishna faith and NigaHiga is still doing the same exact same shit as the "How to be Ninja" days. Some things never change.
