If you knew who I was, you'd be shocked.  You'd say "don't do this," or "your life's good, how can you be so selfish to think it's worthless."  And it's true.  A lot of people love me.  I have a lot to enjoy now and a lot to look forward to in the future.  But sometimes I feel like it's all worthless just because something small fucked up my whole day or my whole week.  And that little something tends to be connected to a larger problem in my life, like it's indicative of something I hate about myself and that I suspect other people hate.  At moments like these, I sometimes go on Amazon, search "sleeping pills", and debate buying a bunch just so I can have a stash if I ever decide to kill myself in the future.  It's not that I thoroughly hate myself.  It's just that sometimes I want to see what would happen if I really was gone forever.  How would my family take it, how would MIT take it, how would my friends take it, how would people in my dorm and especially my hallmates take it?  Honestly, I think there'd be a week at most of sadness and then people would move on, just like when the last couple of students who offed themselves.  So it's really not worth it.  Anyway, I just wanted to speak up anonymously.
