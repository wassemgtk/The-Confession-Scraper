i spent all of last semester locked away in my room afraid of interacting with people due to the rejections that i've faced from friends who didnt understand/care about my mental illness. I went on leave this semester, and it kills me that no one's noticed that i'm not around anymore. it kills me that i didn't really make friends that would care that i'm gone
