Whoever left easter eggs all over campus today was extremely inconsiderate. Honestly, I found it to be very triggering, as it brought back terrible memories of the time I had seven eggs shoved up my ass with an "alien egg-depositing dildo" (referenced here: http://www.vice.com/read/the-emerging-fetish-of-laying-alien-eggs-inside-yourself). plz tag ur triggers next time.
