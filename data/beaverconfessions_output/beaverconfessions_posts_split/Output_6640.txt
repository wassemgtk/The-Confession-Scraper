I read an article in the new york times about, "brogramming". It was written by someone who clearly never stepped into a software development shop in her life. She implied that software development was full of these hard drinking, hard smoking, hyper masculine guys like miners or construction workers. I had no idea how tough I was. My 5'7'' 140 pound body is a representation of an imposing male? lol I wish. On that note, we want more women in software. It's a bigger sausage fest here then the marine corps.
