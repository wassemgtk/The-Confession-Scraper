I was talking about protesting the north carolina anti gay law. A well meaning libertarian friend of mine asked if this same law could force a black business owner to serve the KKK. I explained no that discrimination is legal. He asked if that's fair that only certain people get that protection. It's a fair question. Let me answer for people who aren't sure why. In short yes. You see certain minority groups such as gays and African-American are victims in our white straight society. Most of them due to obstacles put in front of them can't succeed without some extra help. That's where people like him and I come in. As straight white males it is our job to help make sure laws like this don't pass and give victims a boost when we can. Thus we use our riviledge to help put in anti discrimination laws against them and so forth. Think of society as a family. You help out your little brother or sister. Privileged people arethe older kids, victims are the little ones.
