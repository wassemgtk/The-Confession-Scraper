Sometimes in the mornings, there is a guy in Verdes that constantly makes me angry. We talk about students not treating the Verdes staff with the respect they deserve as people, and that is bad enough, but this guy is that and worse. I presume he is some sort of manager; he does not wear the maroon polos and generally wears business-type clothing and nice shoes. But he is so incredibly mean and condescending to the women behind the registers and those making sandwiches. Maybe this is just me, but he is just plain mean to them. "(name), are you here to work today or are you here to play?" "Look there are only two burritos left, I told you, go make more, what are you stupid?" He ought not be such a dick.
