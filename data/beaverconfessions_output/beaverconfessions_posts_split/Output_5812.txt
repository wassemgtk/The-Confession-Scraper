Due to the fact that racialized sexual and dating practices are discriminatory and a plague to our society, I have proposed the following law, which I believe should take effect as soon as legally permissible:

A federal Bureau for Fair Sex (BFS) shall be established with the ability to enforce the provisions described in this law.  Every instance of sexual intercourse, dating, or dancing shall be reported to this Bureau for recordkeeping, along with the race of the sexual intercourse, dating, or dancing partner.  Failure to accurately report this information to the BFS will result in a fine of $1000 for first offense, and an imprisonment term of no less than 1 year for second offense, and an imprisonment term of no less than 10 years for subsequent offenses.  

For each individual, the frequency distribution of the races of said individual's sexual partners shall be computed and compared to that of the racial composition of the United States via a chi-squared goodness-of-fit test.  A chi-squared test statistic shall be computed for each individual.  

Individuals found with confidence in excess of 75% to be racially selective in their sexual preferences shall be fined $1000, enrolled in a mandatory sexual-reeducation class, and required to register as a sex-preference offender.  

Individuals found with confidence in excess of 90% to be racially selective in their sexual preferences shall be required to register as a sex-preference offender, imprisoned for 3 years, and upon release sent to sexual-reeducation camp for 2 years.  Such camps shall be established at the direction of the Bureau for Fair Sex.  

Individuals found with confidence in excess of 99% to be racially selective in their sexual preferences are unfit for this society, and shall be imprisoned for life without possibility of parole.  

Similar provisions shall be established for those who are racially selective with their dating partners and those who are racially selective with their dancing partners.  For racially-selective dancing offenders, the above punishments shall be tripled.

I firmly believe that this law will speedily make our society into a fairer one with equal sexual opportunity for all.  Moreover, my intent in introducing this law is entirely altruistic; as an asexual individual, I have nothing to gain from the benefits this law will confer.
