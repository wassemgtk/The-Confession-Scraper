I love someone enough to want to have a baby with him, yet not like him enough to want to be committed to him. And why? All because I personally know somebody else, so beautiful and elegant, that even though i could never find his cold heart deserving of my love, I could not imagine being with anyone any less, although superficially, perfect.
