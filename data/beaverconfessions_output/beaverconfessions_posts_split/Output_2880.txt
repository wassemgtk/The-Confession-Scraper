I am kind of disappointed that MIT is still not a place where I could dedicate 90% of my time to studies/research without being judged. I mean, I totally get some people want to still get drunk 3 nights of the weekend, and I do that sometimes just to conform, but honestly I kind of want to be less like that, not more. Unfortunately, there is sometimes a vibe that it is apparently cool or smart to not know what is going on in class but still do well on exams.
