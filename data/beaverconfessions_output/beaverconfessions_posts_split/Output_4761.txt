i love my roommate. i do. but i think i'm beginning to harbor some resentment towards her. sometimes i feel like she's not there for me when i need her most, but also money is a thing that i just can't get out of my head. as similar as we are we're not at all from the same class and that's become more and more noticeable over the three years we've lived together. whether it's care packages from her parents or knowing that she feels perfectly at home in a fancy restaurant while i squirm in my seat, it still ends up making me feel like nothing and then i start to hate her for that. i know it's not her fault. it's not mine either. it just is. and as much as i don't want to consider leaving my best bud after all these years, i just don't think i can do it anymore.
