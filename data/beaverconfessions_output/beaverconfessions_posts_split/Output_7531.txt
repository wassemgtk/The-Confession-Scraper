t is very disappointing to see how MIT's staff or MIT in general sides with Bon Appetit, and even when it is obvious that one of the dining halls was responsible for the stomach bug, instead of trying to find a way to help students and see what is wrong with Bon Appetit they just send a massive e-mail delimiting Bon Appetit's responsibility. Bon Appetit has been doing whatever they please, and whenever we approach MIT housing or similar departments, they say they don't have anything to do with it. We didn't go looking for Bon Appetit and hired them, MIT housing made us use its service. Now, MIT's departments should control this business and be willing to help out the students.
