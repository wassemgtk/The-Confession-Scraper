I feel like the controversy that has come up after FB gave everyone the option of changing their profile picture to a temporary one with the colors of the French flag on it has parallels to "all black lives matter" and "all lives matters" controversy that arose last semester. It's interesting because with the #alllivesmatter movement people seemed to argue that it was unjust to claim #allblacklivesmatter because in their eyes, all lives are the same so all lives matter just as much as black ones. However, someone explained to me that the #alllivesmatter movement was hurtful to the racial equality movement because it was devaluing their statement. From what I understood, they saw the target of black lives from the police as meaning their lives matter less. So with their movement, they aimed to emphasize that black lives mattered *just as much* as all the other lives. So, saying "all lives matter" as a response was almost the equivalent of saying the problem they were trying to bring to light didn't exist. Now, it seems that bringing up all lives matter when people hurt for Paris is insensitive. But it is hard to ignore that there is definitely inequality in the way conflict and events like these are portrayed in the media. It almost seems as if Western life does matter more than all lives, which shouldn't be the case right? I feel like Paris seems more close to home and that's why we feel more, it might be human nature? I don't know, these past couple of days in the world make me sad :( I wish everyone would mobilize efficiently and correctly in a direction that would end humans taking each others' lives :(
