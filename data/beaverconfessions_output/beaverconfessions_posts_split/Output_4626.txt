Honest question to Asian Americans with generic names: does it affect your life in any way? i.e. knowing that your first and last name is super common and that there are other people who share your exact name (even at the same school)? 

I say Asian Americans because they are more directly affected by their English name (versus an Asian with an English name is probably a nickname/ secondary to their original name), and Asians seem to share common first and last names more than other ethnic groups, although I am perfectly willing to admit that I as a nonAsian might have a biased observation.
