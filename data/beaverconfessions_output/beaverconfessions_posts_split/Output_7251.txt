So today I found myself spending time with a small group of friends that I recently got acquainted with and at one point I got a little overwhelmed at how close they were. They were basically brothers and sisters. The way they went through pictures of their time together, fondly recollecting their memories honestly left me a little jealous, and made me feel like I was intruding. I’m not saying I don’t have any friends, but I wish I had relationships like that, it must be a very happy way to live.
