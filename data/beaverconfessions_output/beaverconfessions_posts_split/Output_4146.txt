So like..a lot of posts have been about Mental Health...I know lots of misconceptions and disagreements about quality etc but...can we all agree that Medical as in Urgent Care and all the other specialty parts are fucking terrible? Misdiagnoses, incompetent staff, long ass waits (I'm not just talking about Urgent Care, also the other sections too. It's like..why the fuck is the ear and eye doctor not able to see me until 2 months later? Do that many students need to see the ear and eye doctor?).  I'd rather get sick and wade it out than go to Medical most of the time. Jeez.
