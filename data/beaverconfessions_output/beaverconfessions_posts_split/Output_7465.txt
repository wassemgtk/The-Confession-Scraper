I have no idea how to make new friends. The friends I have now are the ones I made in freshman year, and I feel stuck with them. I've realized that they're not the best influences on me, and I'm not close with any of them except maybe one or two. I always thought that if I had bad friends, I could just change them, but I have no idea how to do that, especially in the middle of the year.
