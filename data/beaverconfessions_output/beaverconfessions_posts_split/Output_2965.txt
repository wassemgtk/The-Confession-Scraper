Some of my professors are being assholes and actually assigning MORE work than usual for this week and weekend even though they KNOW this weekend is CPW. I think it's ridiculous that we don't get some sort of break (in  the form of canceled class or lighter workload) over CPW. 

CPW would not even be possible without the students and I know a lot of people wouldn't have even come here if it weren't for CPW. 

Really MIT, you care so much about the pre-frosh but then don't give a shit about us when we are actually students. I don't give me that "we care" bullshit, especially when you spend more money putting up fucking tents and then replacing the grass on Kresge lawn that was ruined by said tents than you do on keeping student facilities up to date (flood in New House, mice in dorms, drain roaches in McCormick, need I go on?). In a sense, you are abusing free labor.

MIT would probably not even have students (or at least not enough students to keep MIT going) if it weren't for CPW because I know that for a lot of people CPW was either their only chance to visit MIT or the deciding factor on whether or not to enroll here. 

I say that the students of MIT should petition for a break over CPW weekend and threaten to boycott it. Let's see how CPW goes without us.
