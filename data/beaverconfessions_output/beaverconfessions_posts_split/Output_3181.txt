Does anyone else think springfest is a huge waste of money? The past 3 years they have spent $$$ on washed up artists that no one wants to see. In addition to directly spending our tuition money on this, they double dip and charge us for tickets. They end up spending ~ $100 per student who attends springfest. I could buy some really great tickets for shows in Boston with that money....
