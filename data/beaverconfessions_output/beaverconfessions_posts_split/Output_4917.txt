Depression is such a shitty thing, it's like a little guy goes into your brain and has a negative answer to every positive thing you think about. And just when you think you've pushed him out of your brain and he's gone forever, one small event will cause him to resurface. This is when you realize that you never actually got him to leave. Nope, you just dug a hole, shoved him in, and buried him under piles of artificial goals and routine and superficial relationships, hoping you would become so immersed in being a pawn in the game of society that you would forget he was even there. But reality is there, underneath all of it. You know that it means nothing to score a summer internship, to get an A in a class, to make a new friend. What next? You'll want a full time job, to get an A in the next class, to enhance your friendship with this person. For what? The small glint of satisfaction that swiftly leaves minutes after you get what you've been chasing for so long? Is it worth the nights of crying, the hours of disappointment, the days of contemplation of your own self-worth when something comes in the way of your chase? 

The shitty thing about depression is it makes you realize that life is this game. But that knowledge is not helpful. In fact, it's agonizing, knowing you are just this pawn following societal norms and the laws of physics and there is nothing you can do except keep on playing, or cease to exist.
