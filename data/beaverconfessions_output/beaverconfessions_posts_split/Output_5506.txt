I just made the decision to drop to half load, and now I'm really worried. I know it's best for me and my health--I've had a really rough semester, but I was already on CAP warning. I want to take more than 48 units next term and I think I can manage it--does anyone have any ideas on how to convince the CAP to let me do that? (Also, I'm pretty freaked out about maybe not graduating on time.)
