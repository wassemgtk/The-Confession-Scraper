why has this place not produced anyone actually notable? it's fucking embarrassing the more i think about it.

consider: bill gates, zuckerberg, jfk, obama

consider: google, elon musk

consider: alan turing, jeff bezos, john nash

consider: both clintons, both bushes, grace hopper

not to mention (lol) newton, darwin

and we just have a lot of b-listers. counting on you guys to fix this.
