I think I'm addicted to competitive programming... can anyone help me? For years I didn't even realize this was an addiction...

But you guys should participate in the Codeforces Round tomorrow at http://codeforces.com/blog/entry/43848, the problems are written by some of my friends (who might also be addicted...)
