There is something I have been meaning to get off my chest for a while now… I am pretty sure I emit squirrel pheromones. It all started sophomore year when the room I moved into had a hole in the bug screen covering the window. I like to leave the window open and one day I woke up with a squirrel on my leg. I lost my shit and freaked out. The squirrel freaked out too, scratched my leg and jumped out the window. I spent the next week getting tested for rabies and, thankfully, wasn’t infected. From that point forward, I always kept my window shut. But still every few days, I would wake up and see a squirrel scurrying back and forth across my window sill or pressed up against the glass… I started to get a little spooked. Months went by without any change. One evening, it was raining hard and getting really humid in my room, so I opened the window. I had two problem sets due at midnight which I was scrambling to do as per usual. Then I suddenly remembered I was late for choir practice, which I had completely forgotten, and I rushed out of my room… forgetting to close the window… I came back to a foul stench — the smell of animal faeces. I looked around the room, and saw little brown spheres everywhere. There was one on my pillow, on my bedsheets, on my laptop, several near the open window, a few on my chair and one on my pset. There was also a splosh of yellow next to the window. I spent the night finishing my work standing up. I also looked it up later, apparently squirrels like to move around when they do their business, which explains how this squirrel hit up so many things in my room. I finally decided to get the bug screen replaced and kept my window shut for the rest of the now spring semester. The day I was moving out of that room, I decided to open the window (why not, right). My mom had finally given me the moon cakes my relatives had sent for me. I went to the bathroom and when I came back, there was a new hole in the bug screen, my moon cakes had been opened, smashed to bits and partially eaten… that fucker. In the fall of my junior year, I moved to a new room and I thought I would finally be free of these squirrels… but no. Every week or so, I would wake up to a squirrel at my window. One time when I was at home showering in my attic, a squirrel was staring me down from my skylight… Sometimes, when I’m in library, I see squirrels glaring at me through the window. What the hell eh? Was I some squirrel god in my previous life?… Am I Kate Upton, but for squirrels?… Or am I a superhero? Like Ant Man, but Squirrel Man.
