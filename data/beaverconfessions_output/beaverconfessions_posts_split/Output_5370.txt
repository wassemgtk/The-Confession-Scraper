@ #3071 If you don't mention any suicide plans, I am 99% sure they will not kick you out. Even desire to self harm shouldn't do it as long as you don't describe it as at the level of seriously considering suicide. This is coming from someone who WAS forced to leave. I said A LOT to S^3 and Mental Health before it got to that point. Try going back to S^3 and asking to see Miri Skolnik. She has always been super sensitive in my experience. Also, to you and anyone else, if you are seriously contemplating suicide, please get help even if you are scared of getting kicked out. MIT IS NOT WORTH DYING OVER.Yes, sometimes withdrawals are coerced (which, of course, is pretty concerning), but it takes a decent amount to get there, more than suicidal thoughts, if a low level of intent is expressed. And if you do have to leave, there is a decent chance you will be able to come back eventually. Plus, you can always see a therapist outside of MIT. No risk of withdrawal then :)
