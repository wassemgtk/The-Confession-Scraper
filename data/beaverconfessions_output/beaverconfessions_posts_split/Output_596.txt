My first year at MIT has been weird. This is really the first time I've found myself struggling to manage school, work, or just life in general. People sometimes say that going to MIT is like drinking from a firehose, and I certainly felt that way; there were rarely moments when I didn't feel busy and way too many moments when I felt overwhelmed with commitments. There were times when I just didn't feel like getting up, going to class, or doing anything, and I didn't. There were times when it felt like nothing was going my way and there wasn't anything I could do about it. And there were times when I just stopped giving a shit.

Yet after all of that, I'm immensely grateful for my time here. I've had my share of unfortunate events, but for every one of those, I've had many more great experiences. I'm so thankful for all of my wonderful friends for helping me get through a difficult year. I feel like I've learned so much about myself, and I think I've started to figure things out, if only a little bit. I've come to realize that making the most out of MIT doesn't mean working 24/7. It's about knowing when friends are more important than work, being there for your friends when they need it, and having friends who will be there for you when you need it. We're incredibly lucky to go to a place with such amazing people.

Looking forward to the next three years. It's been real.
