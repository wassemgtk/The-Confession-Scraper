My first term GPA here was a 3.7, Freshmen Spring. It wasn't even that bad compared to the 3.2 that followed Sophmore Fall. 

Lucky for me, I had a very supportive family. They told me not to worry, especially since I'm not going to grad school. "There's plenty more to life," my mom would always tell me over the phone in English, with a scent of Chinese accent, "MIT is a hard school; what matters is you've put in 100% of effort and learned something."
Then my dad would jump in and joke about how he almost failed college back when he was a student himself.

And my GPA was indeed getting better; while last semester was a little slip off, I was still able to raise my cumulative GPA little by little.

But now, all of that was for nothing. My traitorous little brother has revealed to my parents that I am, in fact, more addicted to video games than they think, and I spend anything from 20-40 hours a week on games. Shouldn't have accepted any of those friend requests. 

Dad didn't care that much, but mom was pissed; apparently she went around the house screaming she'll find every gaming device in the house and burn them all along with me or something. And I would wake up everyday with more and more missed call notices on my phone.

She just called again, and I think it's time to face my fear. 

I really should've finish XCOM2 sooner.
