I miss the old EC, straight from i3 EC. Built up the rides EC, set on the Ball EC.  I hate the new EC, the subdued EC. The dull, rude EC, just so confused EC. I miss elite EC, turn up the heat EC. I gotta say, at that time you couldn't beat EC. See I invented EC, it wasn't any ECs. And now I look and look around and there's so many ECs. I used to love EC, I used to love EC. I even had the dyed hair, I thought I was EC. What if EC made a post, about EC? Called "I Miss the Old EC," man that would be so EC. That's all it was EC, we still love EC. And I love you like EC loves EC.
