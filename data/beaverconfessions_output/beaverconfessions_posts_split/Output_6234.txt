I'm really sick and tired of the mixed messages the institute keeps sending us. There's this huge push for us to take care of ourselves and our mental health but at the same time every class I take sends me the message along the lines of "I don't care if you don't sleep, you better finish your work if you want to pass this class." Even when I speak directly to the staff, they remain unsympathetic. I don't understand what the hell the point in trying to get us to better our health when all we get is shat on by the institute anyway.
