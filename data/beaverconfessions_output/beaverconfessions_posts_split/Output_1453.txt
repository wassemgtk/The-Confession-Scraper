For a while I lived in single-gender accommodations, not because I preferred one sex over the other, but because I didn't want to deal with social/sexual posturing. I wanted my living space to be a "home base" free of hostility, and in mixed groups I can sometimes sense people of the same sex trying to step on me and each other in order to show off. Thankfully this has occurred less commonly/overtly as I progressed through MIT.
