Question from local grad alum here:
I've been around MIT and Cambridge a while but I've never heard of an oobleck pool being made somewhere on campus or elsewhere around town. Not that I heard about many undergrad things necessarily and grad groups always tried to convince ppl to be real grownups and go to classical music concerts and stuff instead of actually fun things...

So....does anyone ever make oobleck pools large enough to attempt running across on campus? And how does one find out when and where?
