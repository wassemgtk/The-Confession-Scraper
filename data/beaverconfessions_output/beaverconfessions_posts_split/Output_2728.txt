I was overhearing a couple people complain about the lack of diversity in tech. I asked them if they wanted it done by census, you had to have each race represented by their proportional population? They eagerly squealed yes. I then asked if they were okay with quotas limiting the number of asians who could get in and affirmative action for every other race including whites since every race is underrepresented in tech except asians. They are overrepresented by huge numbers. Those two shut up quick.
