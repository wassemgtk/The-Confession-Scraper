Some of the saddest moments in my life include getting an F on my first exam at MIT and opening a brand-new jar of peanut butter only to destroy the perfect, creamy contour which lacked any discontinuities.

Some of the happiest and most rewarding moments in my life include getting an A in that class and later, enjoying the PB&J sandwich that followed from that freshly opened jar.

Unfortunately, in life, you have to hurt a little to enjoy a little.
