I never tip in restaurants/ delivery service because I do not see why I should. Tipping was not expected in my home country, and it's really hard to understand here.
I can never imagine that the quality of my outcome to be determined by salary, only by responsibility/understanding of importance. If you're a kind of a person with no personal threshold of quality of your output, I do not want to tip you at all.
