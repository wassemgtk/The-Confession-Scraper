I will never be as beautiful, confident, or fit as the pole dancers at Senior Haus. I have come to the conclusion that Senior Haus possesses the finest people on campus. They don't need attention, they don't care what people think. Or at least that's how it comes across. I want to possess such a presence, but I know I never will. And quite honestly, I am happy with who I am.
