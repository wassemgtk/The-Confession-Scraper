So it looks like I'm going to get 3 C's and an A in my second semester freshman year. PNR was so much easier for me and I got better grades but no one will ever know. I hate that I am so upset about my grades because even though MIT is not that competitive, I can't help compare myself. I just can't wait to take classes in my major and do well.
