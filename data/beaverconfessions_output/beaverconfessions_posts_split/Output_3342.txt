@5092 Oh yes, John Oliver, that great purveyor of political wisdom and master of open discourse. Look, making fun of people is great and all (I do it all the time; I do it re: _Trump_ all the time), but shows like Oliver's are intentionally biased, skewed, and unfair. The only people you convince to your side with that shit are the people who were hypersympathetic to your views in the first place. Don't pretend like such media is anything approaching real discourse (or even that it's a legitimate tool for _opening_ real discourse), and don't pretend it serves any other purpose to the people supporting the other side than just further entrenching them in their (in your mind bogus-ass) views.

Oh, and for the love of GOD don't watch that shit as "news" or to "keep informed", my god, pick up a copy of the fucking WSJ or NYT.
