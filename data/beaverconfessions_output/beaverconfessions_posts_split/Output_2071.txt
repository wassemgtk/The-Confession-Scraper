It's so sad that here human health is taken so not seriously.. Then MIT wonders why it gets such terrible reputation.. Seriously, fuck you MIT medical! Countless reasons why MIT fails to take care of its students but Medical contributes a big chunk. Health matters the most in this life no matter what. Once one loses their health, nothing else matters, success, grades, job search, nothing. MIT as an institution fails at understanding this.
