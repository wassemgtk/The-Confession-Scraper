I am actually for standardized testing in its current form and I have a good reason. How else are we supposed to know how the kids from various districts are doing against one another without them? Teachers have every reason to game their own grades to make their own students look good. Giving every kid the exact same test and time limit is the only way we will actually know how the kids are doing. I hear people complain, "oh teachers will have to teach to the test, we are not teaching critical thinking". Yes we are. Life is about passing tests, we all passed tests to get in here, you have to pass tests to get a job, that's life, kids need to get that lesson. Most people don't use, and usually don't need critical thinking anyway. The real reason teachers are against it is because they don't want to face the music and have to take the chance that they might be exposed as incompetent and get fired. Also, nobody admits this, but they could actually turn down the standardized tests legally. All they have to do is turn down federal funding. But they won't do that, they like getting 165 days of paid vacation a year, fat pensions, fat insurance plans, and for the top ones, 6 figure salaries, more then their own school freedom.
