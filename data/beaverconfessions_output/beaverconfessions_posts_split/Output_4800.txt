To the OP who pointed out why the election is so important due to the growing power of the president. Do you think maybe we have the wrong approach to the problem? Maybe the president should not have so much power? Many of us on the left are eager to expand it now and let Obama make his own rules on climate change, drone warfare, drugs, etc, etc. Most of us were too young to remember but when George W. Bush was in office he used that same power to squash stem cell research, start the NSA spying programs, fund Christian extremists. The problem with this power is that it's too potent, it can be used against those without a voice as well. I think a better solution is to push for laws that limit executive power to ensure that although change slows down, a very real threat from a Donald Trump figure can't do any real damage in the white house.
