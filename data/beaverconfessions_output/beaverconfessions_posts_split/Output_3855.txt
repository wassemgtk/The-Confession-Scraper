Stages of getting out of a toxic group: 
1. Denial: I mean they're not too bad- they're way better than the gang from it's always sunny
2. Epiphany: Wow people don't have to live like this 
3. Loneliness: I mean anything's better than them but sitting here alone ain't great 
4. Excitement: I'm gonna meet new people today! Are they gonna like me? Better try and look presentable 
5. Catharsis: I saw you all and didn't get annoyed. I really really mean it when I say I hope you all get exactly what you deserve.
