To whoever made that piss poor King of Hearts spread in the Tech, why are you not giving this event the appreciation it deserves? It's more than just a "Male beauty pageant the was in Walker memorial" as you mentioned in Every. Single. Unoriginal. Caption. You seemed to forget how the event was indeed a fundraiser for Women's Heart Health that raised about $5700 for the cause. Please give the organizers and participants the credit they deserve for this awesome event!
