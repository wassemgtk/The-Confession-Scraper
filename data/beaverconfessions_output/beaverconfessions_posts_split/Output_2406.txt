All my life I've been called a loser, a geek, a stupid kid with big dreams. But, things began to change the moment she walked into my life - things felt different for the first time in years. I felt like I was something, like I - even I - had a voice to be heard. Like there was someone out there to listen to me and care.

Yet, like many of the friends I've cared about in the past, she walked out of my life just as soon as she had meant the world to me. Now the moments and laughs we shared are nothing more than distant memories and I to her am just slightly better than a stranger.

Now there are moments between psets, between the firehose of activities at MIT wherein I catch myself crying. Those are the moments when I question why things happened the way they did that I finally remember: I'm just a loser, a geek, a stupid kid with big dreams.
