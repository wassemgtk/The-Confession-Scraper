I'm a senior now about to graduate, and it really saddens me that MIT forced me to understand that it's not me who will change the world, but the world that will that should change me. I mean, if I can't even fix the card-tap garbage [where you can't even let in your friends], or the shit dining policy [food is bad, mandatory food is worse], or even divestment fossil fuels [yay for MIT supporting polluting the world] at MIT, what honestly can I do for the real world.  I remember hopping into this place all happy and excited about doing great things, but now, all I want to is to settle down, get a job, and live in comfort. I will support Hillary or Kasich, be a moderate progressive, and pay my taxes, continue my participation in unambiguously good projects like Amphibs, and eventually die. This has all left me very, very sad, but all in all, I want to thank MIT for opening me up to the real world and showing how insignificant I am.
