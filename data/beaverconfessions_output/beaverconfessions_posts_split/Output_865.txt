I have mixed feelings about complaints about the intensity here. I want the 'tvte to be as welcoming as possible, but I totally thrive in this environment. I didn't really realize it until I finished my last big project of undergrad, but I enjoy having meaty technical problems I *need to* work on or think about every time I have a moment to spare. Now when I have these moments to spare, all there's left to do is study for my last GIR. It feels empty.
