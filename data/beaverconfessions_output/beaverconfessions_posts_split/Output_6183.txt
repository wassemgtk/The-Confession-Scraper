As I wait to cross the street at 77 Mass, I see an attractive human being on the other side. Our eyes connect. I immediately look away so I don't give him the impression that I'm just another drooling creep. I swing my head from side to side looking at the traffic lights on both sides, but really I am only trying to get more and more glimpses of him. Fuck, the light turns red. Heart palpitates. We both start walking towards each other. I smell his cologne in the atmosphere, ooh yeah. I smile at him, he smiles back. My life is complete, for the moment. Two seconds later that damn Old Town Trolley bus is honking full blown at me. I arrive at the same time, same place, every day for weeks. Months. And never see him again. Ever. FML.
