Honestly, the world's sensitivity has gotten out of hand. All of this uproar about sexism, racism, sexuality, etc has created an environment where cautiousness is valued over expression. Grow some thicker skin. The fact that people complain so much about these topics give the topics power over them. I'm part of a minority group and have heard my fair share of discrimination, but I honestly couldn't care what they.

Are other people's mental psyche so weak that they can't ignore strong words?
