I have a "friend crush" on this person who is always so nice to me. I dont want to date them, I just really want to be friends because they're such an amazing person. The smallest little things that they'll say, probably thinking nothing of it, will just make my day and leave me looking back at it for days smiling like an idiot and wishing we could talk more tp the point I daydream about having friendly conversations with them. But so far all of the conversations have been initiated by me and I have no social skills so I'm pretty sure I come off as really pathetic and clingy. I get so attached to people who are unusually kind to me because I'm so unaccustomed to it and I never know what to do. How do you be friends with someone you desperately want to be friends without bothering them???
