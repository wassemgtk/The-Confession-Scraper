I absolutely love physics, but I’m not good enough at it. I love the problem solving, and the concepts are so fun and fascinating to me! It truly interests me, and I am very passionate about research in the field. However… No matter how hard I try, I just can’t get good enough grades in it. I do have other talents, but none that I feel passionate about. Even my advisor gave me a disbelieving look when she saw my physics grade was the lowest last term. I get the concepts, but I just suck at the tests. My parents even think I should change majors… The worst part is that I probably will. I feel so sad… I wish I were smarter :( Then I wouldn’t have to give up on something that makes me truly happy.
