There's this guy I really really really like who's basically just perfection personified. He claims to like me back, but he's sooo bad at responding to my messages. I just counted, and in the last time period I've sent him 45 messages and he's only sent me 3 in reply!! No matter how many facebook stickers I send him, even gifs telling him he's my one and only, he never responds! What a dick!
