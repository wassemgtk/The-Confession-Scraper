I know that everyone shits, but I get so embarrassed when people hear me do it. If someone else is peeing in the other stall, I hold it in until they leave. If the other person is also taking a shit, I cover my ears and hope they leave soon. And when I'm done, I wait until everyone at the sink has left the bathroom so they won't know it was me.
