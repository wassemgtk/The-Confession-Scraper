As an alum, I sometimes regret attending MIT because of the student debt I now have. I should have crunched the numbers before I started, but I made some bad assumptions. Now I'll be lucky to have paid off everything in another ~8 years. Until then, my choice of jobs, choice of activities, and ability to make it to see my family back home are all impacted by trying to make the numbers work. I wouldn't trade the friendships I made at the 'tute for anything, but it's led to many a sleepless night.
