I feel my empathy may be broken. The news of Phoebe's death didn't affect me at all, and I don't know why people who knew her were.  The Boston bombings didn't influence me either, even when I knew people affected. I have to avoid talking about tragedies with people, because I can't tell where the line is where people generally start becoming upset. And I don't know whether to feel grateful or miserable that I don't feel someone else's pain the way you do.
