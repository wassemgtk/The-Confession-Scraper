Am I the only one extremely annoyed with this "sleep is for the strong" campaign? They've been spamming everywhere about it multiple times, and have signs everywhere.

What are they actually hoping to accomplish? Awareness isn't going to do anything about the fact that MIT is hard, it's the toughest school in the world for a reason. I chose to go to this school because of the challenge, and accept the fact that "sleep is for the weak". Focusing your time into this campaign is, in my opinion, a waste of time.
