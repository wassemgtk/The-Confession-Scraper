I would bet a good fraction of students here have never had a serious case of imposter syndrome. And there are definitely at least a handful of kids for whom classes are a piece of cake. Geniuses exist, and if you don't know them, you probably pass a few in the infinite every day. So thanks for trying to support me, but please don't insult my intelligence by telling me that the folks running around with 4.9's and 5.0's are deep down insecure about their place at MIT. Not everyone says this, but I hear the "everyone struggles" spiel too often. It's about as helpful as if at that horrible moment of the swim test when I knew I wouldn't pass it, when I felt like I was drowning, someone told me that everyone was actually secretly fat and out of shape, just like I was.
