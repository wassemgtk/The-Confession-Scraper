I just want a few completely free days every month where all I'd have on my plate is to just read fiction for leisure, or write freely, or read/write poetry, or play instruments, or sing, or go to museums and plays and operas.
I'd still want to go here and do the science thing but have time set aside for these things so that I don't feel guilty spending many hours/days on these things, and so that I can actually enjoy doing them in the moment.
