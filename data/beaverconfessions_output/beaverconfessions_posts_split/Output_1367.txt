Any other ADHD students out there? I just need to know there is some peer out there who went through this and found a solution. I have been diagnosed for over a decade, but MIT is the first time I have had this level of work. I can't do work without ADHD meds but I can't emotionally function on them and end up having obsessive thoughts. Someone please email me if you have been through this at MIT, it would be very nice to talk. I'm trying to get the most out of this place, and I don't want to miss out on the education and friends.
