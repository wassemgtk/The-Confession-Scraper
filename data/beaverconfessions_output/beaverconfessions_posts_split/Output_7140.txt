I feel like September is just going to suck for me. I've made an uninformed travel decision which resulted in 1.5 additional hours of walking, Saturday's Boston Calling  was cancelled and reopened (though I only knew the latter after the fact), and I never saw the homework that was due today because the email was instantly buried by everything else. 

Just have to power through, I guess.
