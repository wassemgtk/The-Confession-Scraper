MIT financial aid is stupid with respect of international students, and they false advertise themselves to be need based. When converting the earnings of the student family from foreign currency to dollars, they use the exchange rate that was most favorable to MIT in the whole previous year. So if the currency of your country devalued during the year and your family can't pay anymore, they will instruct you to take a gap year, instead of updating your financial aid based on your decrease of income.
