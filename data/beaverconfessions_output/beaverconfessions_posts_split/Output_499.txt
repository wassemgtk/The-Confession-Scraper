Sure wish it was easier to tell if someone was dating anybody. There's a certain student I'm very interested in, but I'm afraid to try and start something, just in case she's taken. Uggghhh why does this dating stuff have to be so hard? Can't some intrepid programmer make a crowdsourced "Are They Taken?" database? Dammit.
