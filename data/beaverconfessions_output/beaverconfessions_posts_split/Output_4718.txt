Closeted Gay Guy Confessions #1- I really like you and want to know you better; go on dates and get to know each other, but you probably don't know how I feel about you.  We are friends and we see each other on a regular basis but I don't think you know.  You probably have an idea.  I see you on those apps and I wish I could talk to you, but it would be super awkward ... I'm not out. Anyways, back to 036.
