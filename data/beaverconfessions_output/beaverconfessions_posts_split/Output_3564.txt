I haven't had much experience with the ladies. I'm a straight guy. I don't like to assume and maybe I'm wrong, but I believe many guys at MIT have had similar experiences. I've been told to put myself out there and I have, but I like to be somewhat creative in most things I do. So, why not try that here? Welcome to the MIT Confessions-Connect Game (MIT-CCG) for short. My goal with this game is to meet a girl with whom I share commons interests and get along with. I'm not necessarily looking for a relationship, but just someone to connect with and if all goes well, maybe a relationship will be the outcome.

MIT-CCG Rules:

** Rules change accordingly depending on your sexual orientation. These is my post and I'm a straight guy. **

1) I will compare 2 situations that can happen with a guy and a girl. It can be any 2 situations. The only thing you have to do is type a ">" or "<" sign between the 2 situations. A greater than sign means that this situation is more favorable for you.  For instance:

"When a guy tries to hold my hand on the 2nd date > When a guy tries to kiss on the 1st date"

2) Now, if a girl from MIT agrees with this situation, please comment on the confession with anything you want to say. Just make sure you indicate somehow that you are consenting to play the game. If you simply want to comment, then just comment. Remember guys, "no means no!"

So now that the OP has stated his 2 situations and has seen that a girl(s) has commented (with consent) on the post, he may proceed with step 3.

3) This step requires a messenger app. Now you message the girl(s) that you are interested in and give her your user name. I will use Wickr since it's confidential.

4) Then you guys can talk and connect. And maybe eventually skype and get to know each other more. Who knows ? :)

Anyone can make their own MIT-CCG Post. I know that this version of the game probably has holes in it and may be an epic fail. So, if anyone can improve on the game, please do and write it on your Confessions Post.

Since I created this game, I will go by the name, OP-IHTFP. If you improve on the game, feel free to create a name for yourself. Now that I explained the rules, I will continue with my situations.

When a guy gives you a handmade gift for Valentine's Day (assuming it isn't generic) > When he buys you a gift (assuming it isn't a Ferrari).
