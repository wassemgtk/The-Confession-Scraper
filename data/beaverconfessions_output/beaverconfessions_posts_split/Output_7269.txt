Well, since I now know he reads this (lol @Confession #1214), I think Adam Hartz is downright awesome. I totally tanked the first 6.01 exam and met with him to talk about it. He gave me advice about how to approach the course and to just not stress about the grades. He seems to *really* care about whether or not we understand we're learning, and while I guess (and would hope) that's true for a lot of teachers, I still think Adam deserves a shout-out!
