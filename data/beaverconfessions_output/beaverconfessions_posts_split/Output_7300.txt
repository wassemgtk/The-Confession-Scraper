I feel like my roommate and I  are as separate as heaven an earth. He's so good at dealing with things like pressure, deadlines and classes. And I feel like I'm just scrambling to scrape by. And I feel bad whenever I have to ask him for help on something. It really makes me question coming here in the first place. I knew I wouldn't be close to the best, but I've never felt this low before.
