Listen, I love you guys, but you westerners have a huge problem. You're all shitting wrong. Seriously, whatever white guy invented the sitting toilet may have been a genius for inventing good sanitation in the days when people chucked poo into the streets, but THE SITTING STANCE IS TERRIBLE FOR POOPING. The natural way to take a dump is to pop a squat and drop that deuce. It's so much easier and faster. Squat on the toilet seat and you'll realize you've been wrong this whole time. I grew up in India before moving to the US and I never ever abandoned my habit of using designated shitting squats.
