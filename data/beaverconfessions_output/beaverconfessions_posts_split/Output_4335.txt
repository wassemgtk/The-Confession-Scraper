I don't mind that both DormCon President and the UA President are white, but I mean #4086 has a point. They don't represent us. Why don't we choose DormCon Presidents with a school-wide election anyway like with the UA? Why didn't they tell us about the freshman housing when they knew about it? Like seriously, why the privacy. Send out another google form pretending like you care about feedback as a place for people to go to, and let people know. It's our school too.
