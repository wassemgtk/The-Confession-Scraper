I'm terrified of using public restrooms. I don't identify as trans, but I don't dress in a cis way. Whenever I use the bathroom for the gender I identify with, I get glared at, and sometimes get asked to leave. I'm also scared of what might happen if I use the bathroom for the gender I dress as and being found out.
