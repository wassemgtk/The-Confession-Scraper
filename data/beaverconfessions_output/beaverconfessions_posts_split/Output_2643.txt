@5767 Hello, 5612 here.  I'm sorry if my post could have been confused for something someone else would think that you wrote, but unfortunately that is one of the downsides of anonymous confessions that people who follow MIT Confessions must face.  At the same time, the fact that no one can prove that you wrote something is one of the advantages of anonymous confessions, so if someone does want to accuse you of making a post (which is a bold strategy) you could always just deny it.  And yes, I am well aware that MIT Confessions is not the optimal medium for solving my problems, but that was not my intention.  5612 was actually an attempt to clarify that the points in 5428 (an earlier post of mine) about being treated like shit and hating this person were not my genuine feelings and rather a melodramatic rage by me (I still stand by the other points however).  I would love to confront my problems, and have made attempts to do so, but it is difficult when this person refuses to acknowledge my existence.  Furthermore, the fact that you are worried about someone confusing you as the OP of 5612 suggests to me that you may actually feel this way about someone or could benefit from clarifying your feelings with someone.  I truly wish you the best of luck and hope that you find yourself in a better position than I.
