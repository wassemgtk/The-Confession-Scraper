As a liberal, I have to say the person who's impressed me the most this election is Jeb Bush, he's the only candidate who's been willing to essentially commit political suicide to make sure Trump doesn't win. Don't get me wrong, I know Clinton and Sanders also have strongly denounced him but that helps them, it takes a different political courage to stand up for what's right despite knowing it'll cost you the election. And with that I salute you, 'Jeb!' (also unrelated note: I agree with a vast majority here of MIT but we have to admit that there is a political dialogue problem in the sense that I'd never publicly express even tangential support like this for a Republican candidate)
