@8046 Not even going to comment on the ultra cruel judgement that suicide is "for cowards". It's unbelievably selfish and narcissistic to make someone'a tragic decision to kill themselves about YOURSELF. It's sad that they couldn't live for themselves- not that they couldn't live "for you". Pretty sure this isn't about you.
