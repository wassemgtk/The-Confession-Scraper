I loved living in senior house, the people were awesome, but I think there is a major problem that people tend to ignore. While there, due to the accesibilty to so many types of drugs I became a drug abuser. I had used more drugs than I ever intended I would and more often. And it really messed up a lot of things for me until I sought outside help. I don't want to bash on anybody, but I really feel like it this type of issue is ignored and downplayed so much. I just hope some changes happen soon in which the people here become become more open to discussing that things like this exist because I love the dorm so much and the people here are so great but I would hate to know that somebody else may have to go through the same thing I did without having any sort of comfortable source of help here.
