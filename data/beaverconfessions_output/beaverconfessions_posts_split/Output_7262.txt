A friend of mine died almost a year ago. He killed himself a week or so after the bombings. I know it wasn't my fault but I should have been a better friend and been there for him when he needed.

Almost a year later, and I still have recurring nightmares that his ghost is haunting me. 

I feel like I should tell someone, but I don't want my family to worry and few of my friends even know this happened. I'm afraid if I tell anyone they'll tell me to go to Mental
Health, which I won't do for other personal reasons.
