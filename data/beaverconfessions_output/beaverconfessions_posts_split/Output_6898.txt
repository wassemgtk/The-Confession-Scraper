I'm way too into BDSM, and I love pretending I'm a pet... 
Yesterday I talked my boyfriend into going to Petco with me and we bought a leather collar and lead for me. We may have tried too hard to make it convincing that we were shopping for an actual dog. I then had him walk me home with it. 
Now he's gone back to his apartment and I'm wearing it while studying for finals. I can't wait to go home for winter break so he can take me on a walk in the forest preserve back home...  
I really think I'm too into bondage and role playing. 
Like... is it worrying that I'm just sitting here with a collar on? 
I just really love the idea of it all. Being a pet. Being entirely under someone else's control, not having my human life to worry about, just worrying about pleasing one person in a way that isn't measured in "success" for once. 
It's a really damn good escape.  
Also, I love my boyfriend so much for putting up with all my quirks and insanity like this. Like... I don't think I could ever find another guy who'll be okay with putting a dog collar around my neck and whipping me with the leash lol. I think true love is being willing to put up with your significant other insisting on being treated like a pet lmfao
