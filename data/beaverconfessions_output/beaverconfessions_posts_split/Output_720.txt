Oh right, the email to the entire dorm about not being a jerk and making a lot of noise in the middle of the night obviously didn't include you all. You can be as loud as you want because nobody has Friday finals. You can shout and hang out loudly in the halls and slam doors because nobody around you has to sleep at all. Next time the head of house sends an email out to the whole dorm, he'll make sure to explicitly exclude you all because you obviously don't give a fuck about other people.
