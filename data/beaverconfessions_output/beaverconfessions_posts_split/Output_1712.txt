so i don't think i'm bi, but i'm  a little confused: i think girls are aesthetically more pleasing than guys. like when i sketch, i usually always sketch a feminine figure. even so, i'm only attracted to guys. sometimes, maybe i'll say, "wow, she's so pretty/attractive," but i would never actually want to date her. i'm pretty sure this means i'm straight? thoughts?
