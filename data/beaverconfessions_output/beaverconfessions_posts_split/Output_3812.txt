Do you know what it's like to constantly feel invisible? Undervalued? Like nothing you do or say will matter in the long run? I've felt like this almost all my life. I used to persevere, but I'm honestly losing strength to constantly fight for my voice to be heard; for constantly fighting for my seat at the table. Not just out in the world, but also within my minority community. Constantly reminding someone to remember you is first of all diminishing to the soul and second, fucking annoying. It really starts to make you question your worth. Even if you were once confident in yourself, these daily reminders that you ain't shit definitely weigh down on your soul. Would ANYONE even miss me if I were gone? Sometimes I wonder, should I fully embrace my invisibility and just disappear?...
