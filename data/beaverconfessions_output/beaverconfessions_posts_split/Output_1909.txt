Behind each one of those beautiful smiles I can see the glint of sadness hidden beneath.  I may not know where your sadness comes from, but every time I see that smile I remember how it feels to make that smile myself.  I want so desperately to convince you that everything will be alright, but I can't do that when I'm not even convinced myself.
