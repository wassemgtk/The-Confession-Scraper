Intellect is so fucking unfair. I know some kid who literally just plays Hearthstone and League of Legends all day and now he's going to Harvard. Meanwhile, I'm working hard all the time and would be happy just to pass my classes. I want to do a PhD, but I don't even think I will even get a job at this rate, let alone get accepted at grad schools. Fuck everything.
