I'm sick of everyone beating around the bush on this. People keep talking about the need for common sense gun control. Good job. But nobody points out that we can pass all the laws we want, even though there are roughly 325 million guns in the civilian population. If we want truly effective gun control we have to begin massive confiscation of those firearms. Particularly hand guns, since they are the usual murder weapon of choice. This will be tough and involve some sacrifice. We should quit talking about background checks and instead figure out who has guns, and how we can effectively use the local police, national guard, and military to confiscate them. We must stand against the NRA in one loud clear voice and say that our right to live without fear trumps your right to have stupid metal toys.
