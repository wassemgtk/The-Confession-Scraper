Depression is real man. If you're like me, you might lie to yourself about it--just because you feel everyone depends on you and you have to be strong for them. If you feel like you've hit rock bottom, talk to someone about it. At the end of the day, mental health is more important than anything else. If you're unhappy or stressed, just remember you have people that care about you and you are not alone. Until you are honest with yourself, you can't be honest with people. This is coming from someone who puts on a face everyday and smiles through all the bullshit. Just be real with yourself. If you can't handle all the commitments (as I'm realizing only 3 years later), don't try and be Superman. Just be happy.
