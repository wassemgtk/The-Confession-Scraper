As a senior, I'm starting to really see the ugly side of MIT - the disgusting corporation side that doesn't give a shit about the students. It really makes me feel small and insignificant here. Like, how many confessions have there been about all the mental health things, and the tents, and housing, etc.  It makes me so disappointed in MIT.  I'm starting to forget why I loved it so much.
