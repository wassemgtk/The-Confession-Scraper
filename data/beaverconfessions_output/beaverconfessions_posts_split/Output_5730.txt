I was walking down building 4 with some friends and they made all these comments about how it smells like throw up...

I laughed casually but really I knew why it smells like that.  On the weekends after coming back drunkenly from parties I walk through building 4 because there's pianos there. I play for a while but then I have this urge to puke.  But I don't make it to the bathroom in time and end up puking on the floors. I clean it up mostly with paper towels and then throw them in the trash.  This happens a lot... :/
