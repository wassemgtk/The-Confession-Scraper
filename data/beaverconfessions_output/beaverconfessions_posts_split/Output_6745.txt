Sometimes I wonder if it is all worth it, 
staying up all night, doing the "right" thing.
I haven't slept for days, struggling to battle this evil.
There are times, I want to stop. 
I want to give in to the evil , let it win. Let it end my torment.
But I know, I must persevere. I must keep going.
For I am, what this school needs....
