You're not perfect. You're not beautiful. You don't have a perfect body and you can't fit into stylish clothes. But none of that matters because your worth as a person has nothing to do with any of that. You are the nicest person I've met, you are respected by everyone, you are one of the only people I trust, and you crush it in classes. Regardless of how you look, the reasons I respect you will not change. You deserve better than years of hating yourself over something as pointless as your appearance.
