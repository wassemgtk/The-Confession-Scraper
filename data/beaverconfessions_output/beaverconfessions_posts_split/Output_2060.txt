Someone told me that it's impossible for straight guys and girls to just be friends. That same person told me that most straight guys fantasize about their platonic girl friends, especially girls they are extremely close with. As a girl with several extremely close guy friends, I've always seen my guy friends as my non-biological brothers. I always thought that they just see me as a sister, but I'm wondering if I might just be completely oblivious.
