I wish I could say the depression and anxiety so frequently found here were entirely the fault of MIT's high pressure academics and flawed Mental Health/S^3 practices. But recently, I've started to see how our student culture negatively impacts the mental wellbeing of me and everyone around me. I hear a lot of bragging, "That problem set was so easy, I can't believe anyone had to go to office hours." "I got an A in that class without doing any work." "Why would anyone take less than 48 units?" Like, I know we're all just filling the void of insecurity we secretly harbor, but come on. Comments like that just fuel others' insecurities, and let's be honest, they don't make you feel better either.

There are many things we can't change about MIT, but this is something we can. Let's stop putting each other down and enforcing impossible standards on ourselves. We're smarter than that. In fact, we're all really fucking talented, and it's heartbreaking to see how few people see themselves in that light.
