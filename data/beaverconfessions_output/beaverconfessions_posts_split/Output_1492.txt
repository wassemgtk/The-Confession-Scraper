Recently I've been seeing these passive-aggressive signs around campus encouraging people not to tap when entering a dorm to avoid the consequences of letting others in behind you who don't tap, and they really annoy me. MIT students (myself included) don't like hassle, and we seem hard-wired to find the loophole to get out of restrictions the administration try to enforce. But I think security should one of the few areas in which we should follow the rules for the greater good. As an undergrad, I used to be part of the dorm security discussion, especially after dorms and FSILGs were being robbed too frequently. Security was bad before tapping and Allied Barton, and there is definitely room for improvement now. Instead of posting signs encouraging people to make their home away from home even less secure in protest, be part of a productive discussion to design a system that allows you as students to keep your dorms safe while not being inconvenienced.
