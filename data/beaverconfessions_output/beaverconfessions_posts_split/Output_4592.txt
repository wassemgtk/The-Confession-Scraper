I've never been so stressed out and never sworn as much as I have in the past 3 days. This week is just shit... I envy everyone around me who seem like they do things so easily and so naturally.

Why the fuck do I struggle in an easy GIR when everyone else is flying through their classes, sports, extracurriculars while simultaneously discovering the cure for cancer and building arc reactors in their dorms.
I was told I was smart in the past. Is everything just a lie now? Am I meant to just drop out and fuck up my life?
