I am an mit student; last year I got married to someone who is a muslim. Our relationship is pretty good. But one thing has been bothering me. Every year my husband sacrifices an animal as a part of his religion. I am pretty much a vegan so obviously animal suffering is important to me. It is legal to do animal sacrifice as long as the meat is eaten. But still it bothers me... I don't know how to approach the situation.
