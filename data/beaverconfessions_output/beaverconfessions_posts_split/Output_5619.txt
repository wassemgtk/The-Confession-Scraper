Instead of murdering innocent green matter by erecting unnecessary tents and having ugly, disheveled construction going on everywhere, MIT could really build:
1. A HEATED underpass at 77 Mass Ave connecting the infinite to the student center
2. Pavement bike lanes along Mem Drive so zooming cars don't quash bikers and zooming bikers don't quash pedestrians.
kthxbye.
