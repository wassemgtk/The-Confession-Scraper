@5612, reading your confession immediately made me think of someone I know. So I hope this reaches you, just in case.
I'm sorry for whatever I did to make you want to see me as a bad person. If I am afraid to face your eotions, then it's time i get over that. When you're ready to talk, i'll be ready to listen.
