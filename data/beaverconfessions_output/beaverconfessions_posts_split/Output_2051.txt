As a graduate student in a program that seems somewhat inclusive relative to the rest of campus, I'm having a lot of trouble meeting new people outside of my building. So far the only luck I've had is small talk in the gym and studying with some undergrads. Dildo.io seems like a great idea except that I don't know anyone's name nor do they know mine. What can I do?
