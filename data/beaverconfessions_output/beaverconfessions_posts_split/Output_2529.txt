I spent my entire last semester at MIT (and a good chunk of my entire undergrad as well) hating the place. Hating it. Hating the cold and the weather and my major and not having enough time to do all the extracurriculars I had come to MIT for in the first place. And now I've graduated and its been almost a year and I realize I miss MIT so fucking much because I've never felt at home anywhere else. I miss living with math majors, and jokes about engineering and friends staying up making robots. I almost want to go back for grad school just so I could be on campus again but my GPA was such shit. If you're there now: enjoy it kids. There's no place like it in the world. I miss my MIT.
