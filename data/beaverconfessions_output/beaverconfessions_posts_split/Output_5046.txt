Some people may have heard about New Orleans. They are planning to take down the statues of Robert E Lee and Jefferson Davis. Some people are arguing that we are white washing history and pretending that history didn't happen. I want to take a moment to clarify why not. What we are doing with these old Confederate monuments is a classic movement in history. When you beat someone in a war, you get the spoils. This includes destroying all their history, monuments, legacy, you name it. When Rome beat Carthage, they salted the earth, burned everything to the ground, and destroyed all their texts, and historical evidence. Or when Cortez conquered the Aztecs and proceeded to not only destroy their capital, but build Mexico city on it and wipe out their language. When you win a war, you for all essential purposes win the other side as property to do whatever you like with, and as enemies, you have no rules or limits on what you can do. The sons of Confederate soldiers should be glad we only want the statues.
