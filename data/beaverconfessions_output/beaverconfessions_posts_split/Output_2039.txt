I'm really struggling to decide between going to MIT or my state school for undergrad. MIT is twice as expensive and I'm not sure how many more opportunities I'll have being average at MIT vs. top of my class at the public school. I'll also have a much chiller time at my state school than here. Plus the weather is nicer.  I DONT KNOW WHAT TO DOOOOO
