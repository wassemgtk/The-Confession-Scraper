"The Never-Ending Great Game"

The rules are the same and changed
For everyone’s a Persian now.
Opposites attract, they claimed.
Maybe that’s why I hate you so now.

But then you had to die
broken up on that great big ash heap.

Maybe things shall be different now
as I plow over that mountaintop
and glimpse
A promised land?
The sun certainly looks glorious
over that shining sea
