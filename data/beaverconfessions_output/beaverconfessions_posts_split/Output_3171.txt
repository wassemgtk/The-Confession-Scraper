@5240 I'm born and raised Asian with the whole crazy high school competition and parents thing, and I can tell you two things. 

One, there is always someone here more disciplined, smarter, with a better background than you. 

Second, I wish I was raised by someone else. I wish that I had been taught how to value something besides academics. I wish I hadn't spent my entire high school career studying. I wish I played more sports, talked to girls more. There is so much else to life, but I have trouble seeing it because my I get all down when I get a bad test grade, or get rejected from an internship.

So, yea, I think we all want to be what we aren't.
