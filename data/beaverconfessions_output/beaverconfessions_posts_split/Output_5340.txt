I just got into my first relationship and recently gotten some comments from people that make me feel like I should feel guilty. I know I'm incredibly lucky to be given a chance, and I know there are going to be rough patches and who knows how long it'll last, but is it so wrong to explore what a relationship is like with an optimist outlook? Like what's the point of pursuing something if you don't think it'll make you happy in the long term? I'm sure later jaded me is going to read this and laugh, but is it so wrong to be innocent for right now?
