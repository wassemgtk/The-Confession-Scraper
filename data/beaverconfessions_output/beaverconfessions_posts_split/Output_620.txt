Something I've wanted to confess for a while: I'm a minority who doesn't look like one, through a combination of recessive genes, some European blood, and my country of heritage having a very diverse people. I hate being judged for it. While I've been here, people have told me I'm not "x" enough, pestered me about what percentage minority I actually am, (and when I explain my skin is white because of colonization some 200 years ago, say "oh, well, you're not really x then"). So my family's 200 years in that country doesn't matter? The fact that I grew up celebrating, cooking, dressing in that culture like my grandparents before me doesn't matter? All of the sudden I'm appropriating my own culture, I have no right to act like I'm "x" because I'm not a real minority. Look, I get that being fair means I have had a different set of privileges, that I don't face the discrimination people who actually look like minorities do, and there are experiences they have that I have had the fortune not to have shared, but that does not mean I'm any less "x" than you are. It doesn't mean I don't have a right to identify with and celebrate my culture, without being judged for being fake or appropriating or whatever.
