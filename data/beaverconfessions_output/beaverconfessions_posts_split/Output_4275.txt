Diyanet issued a new fatwa (AKA religious authority of turkey and much of islam as a whole released statement): A father's lust for his daughter is okay as long as she's nine years old, and kissing her shouldn't affect his marriage. 

And people wonder why so many Americans are reluctant to let nut-jobs like this into our country. I'll be eagerly awaiting all the "not all muslims, this is a minority" defense in the comments. Keep in mind this is the religious authority of one of the largest muslim countries in the world.
