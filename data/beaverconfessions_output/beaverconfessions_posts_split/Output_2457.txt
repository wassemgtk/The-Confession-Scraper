Sometimes when I meet someone new I have this intense urge to get to know them better and become quite close to them.

Unfortunately, I'm socially awkward so this usually doesn't happen. I wish I could approach a person I don't necessarily know too well and just say, "Hello, I think you are really interesting and I'd like to get to know you better."
