I'd just like to say that Trevor McMichael is one of the nicest, most well-meaning, and respectful guys I know. His caption might have offended many of you but I am 100% sure that he did not mean to do so and he does not deserve the hatred that some of you are directing towards him. Please don't let Trevor's one mistake tonight overshadow the countless number of positive things he's done.
