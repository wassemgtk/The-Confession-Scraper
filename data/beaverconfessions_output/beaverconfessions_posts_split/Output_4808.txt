The next time I hear a leftist say "educate yourself" (code for: let us brainwash you with our baseless propaganda), "let's have a conversation" (code for: I'll call you a racist, sexist bigot if you disagree with me because I'm incapable of handling criticism), or "start a dialogue" (code for: I found another first world problem to complain about and force you to conform to), I'm going to scream loud enough to scare the birds off the esplanade.
