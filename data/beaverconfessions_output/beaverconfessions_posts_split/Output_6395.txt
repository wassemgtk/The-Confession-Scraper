I have some friends that are fucking smart. You think I'm just being a typical MIT student. No. I'm talking about International Olympiad Medalist smart. They breeze through all the classes I struggle in and then brush it off like its nothing. They are all so wonderful and amazing, but they give me a complex like none other. I can only dream of being as smart as them but I feel like I've hit this barrier. What I get done in 5 hours, they get done in 1. And yeah you can say all the bullshit about how it doesn't matter how accomplished or smart you are and how no one really cares after MIT, but I can't help but compare, especially as it is right there in my face. I know that any success or failure is my own fault and being bitter about how fucking dumb I am is immature, but I can't help it. Sometimes after staying up late to finish a pset they've already finished 4 hours earlier, I just feel so disgusted with myself. And I know that there's all these study techniques and all these resources available, but really, how much does that help? And I am getting help from my friends, but I just ask them so many questions I'm just frustrated with how dumb I am, regardless of whether or not my friends care. They don't, they're so willing to help it makes me even more angry with how incompetent I am. I'm just a burden, and I don't know what to do with my life, and fuck I'm just a huge fuck-up. Do I even have friends or are they just being nice to me?
