@4025 I'm sorry you feel that way :( I actually cried last night because I thought of some words my boyfriend said to me and they made me so happy and hopeful, even though the realistic part of me was screaming that those words would most likely eventually become lies. Even if there's the crash and burn later on, aren't you otherwise just making the end inevitable? Isn't it loving and caring worth it right now, because it makes you happy right now?
