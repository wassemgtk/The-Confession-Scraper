I don't think I belong at MIT. I don't want to suffer. I don't think learning requires suffering. I don't want to do a million things at once. Sometimes just physically being on campus gives me panic attacks. I just wanted to learn the skills necessary to be an engineer, and picked somewhere I fit in for college. 

I didn't mean to send myself to purgatory.
