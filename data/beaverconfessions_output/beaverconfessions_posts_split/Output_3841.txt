Initially I didn't take Trump seriously when he first announced that he was running, but then I watched him explode in the polls and completely slaughter all of his opponents.

I was very interested in how Trump was able to get attacked by so many people in the first weeks after he announced that he was running and still come out on top.

Eventually realized that it's because he refuses to back down and will never apologize for his beliefs. Even if people disagree with you and hate what you're saying then they seem to respect you as long as you don't back down or apologize.

I decide to start doing this in my own life.

Whenever I talked to people then I used to try a mealy-mouthed approach of attempting to get my points across in an inoffensive way without ever raising my voice and without triggering or offending them, but now I would go in as aggressively as possible, I didn't stop myself from getting angry and shouting at them, and I would try to trigger the hell out of them right from the start of the conversation.

I didn't apologize or try to backpedal on anything that I had said and instead I just followed Trump's example and doubled down to trigger them even harder.

Suddenly people are actually agreeing with me. 

I made a girl that I know cry after shouting at her for thinking that apartheid and South African whites were evil, but now she's practically a Trump supporter and we've been dating for two months.

THANK YOU, TRUMP
