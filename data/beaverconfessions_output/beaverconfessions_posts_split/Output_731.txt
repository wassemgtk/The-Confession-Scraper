Feeling kinda bittersweet about soon never again being an MIT undergraduate student. 

Like we shit our pants when we read that “Congratulations, you’ve been accepted into…” email. And we came here and found other intelligent motherfuckers with other passions, talents and abilities. We busted our asses most nights to finish psets, knowing that one day it would all be over and we would have in our possession a piece of paper certifying our completion in a given department’s criteria. We partied our asses off Friday and/or Saturday nights only to be frantically working all of Sunday. We made or did things that we didn’t know we were capable of making, despite how short coming we may have felt. We influenced and defined our immediate communities.

And now you want us to just leave, after all the crying, sweating, and bitching we have put into this school. After all the shitty PBR and Rolling Rock that was consumed at awkward but crazy parties. After all the team all-nighters we have pulled getting a robot to move or code to run. I know my experiences may not speak for everyone’s but we will never exactly have these exact experiences again. We most likely won’t ever be surrounded by as many intelligent people ever again. And we most likely won’t stay up getting something to work as if our life depended on it (exaggerating).

I feel like the most painful part of my life is almost over, but I don’t know if the most painful part of my life will end up being the best part of my life.
