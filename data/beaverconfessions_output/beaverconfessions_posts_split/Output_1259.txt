Dear Course 20s: if you openly admit to hating math, physics, design, thermo, and mechanics, then you don't get to call yourself an engineer. Just admit it: you're another basic premed, but you think you'll sound smarter if you say you do "biological engineering"

Course 6, you're on blast too. Writing iPhone apps doesn't make you an engineer, either.
