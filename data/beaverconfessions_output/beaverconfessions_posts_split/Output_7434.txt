I've slept with and probably will sleep with enough guys from other schools that it's become convenient to keep pancake mix and syrup in my kitchen cabinet, so that I can make them a quick breakfast before they leave...personally, I hate pancakes. Steel-cut oats are the way to go, but they seem to prefer pancakes
