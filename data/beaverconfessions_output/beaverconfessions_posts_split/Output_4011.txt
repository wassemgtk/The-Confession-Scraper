Ugh. All you privileged right handed people need to be more sensitive about how hard it is to be a left handed person in a right handed world. Everything is catered towards you, right handed people hold enormous amounts of power and privilege over people who are left handed. We have to suffer day after day, struggling to use everyday common tools like scissors, can openers and computer mice. How many left handed desks are in our classrooms? One if we're lucky? When will you learn that there are other people out there who aren't born with the privilege of being right handed. You are all so entitled and it sickens me. Every time I see a right handed person in public flaunting their disgusting righty privilege, I'm forced to remind them that there are others out there who are oppressed daily by this handist society we've built. Fuck you rightys, and fuck your righty privilege.
