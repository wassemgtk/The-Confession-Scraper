wowwwww i shouldn't be and yet i'm still shocked to see a GRT telling rape victims that they should only share their stories in the "proper channel." raping someone = let's not address it. calling someone out on being a rapist = COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE. this is why i never told anyone about my rape, and i live with the guilt every day and i'm terrified he's raped someone else. but the "proper channels" wouldn't have done anything and everyone would've not believed me and instead told me not to ruin a "nice" boy's life, so saying nothing it is. #itsonus when sexual violence is a hypothetical but not when it becomes real and perpetrated by people we know, i guess. good to know that nowhere on campus is safe.
