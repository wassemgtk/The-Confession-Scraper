I honestly feel like I haven't gotten the full freshman experience with the Boston ban in effect.

The administration and UA dropped the ball on getting this resolved as soon as possible and it's a shame to have to think about what this year could have been instead of what it is right now. The UA should have pressured the administration in turn to make Boston act more rapidly in resolving this issue in the first place.

This only shows how ineffective and irrelevant the UA is to managing and improving student life...so much for having someone to stand up for you against the administration.
