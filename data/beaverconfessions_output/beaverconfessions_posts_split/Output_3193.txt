Have any of the class council candidates followed through on the things they promised in their platforms? Let's take Jonathon Brown for instance, he promised (copy pasted verbatim from his campaign facebook page):

• More online resources for PSETS and reference materials
• A “Find a PSET Partner” match at the start of classes
• Work on one homogenous system (Stellar vs. MITx vs.?)
• Potential mixers with other schools in the area
• Student-Faculty Mixers
• I will personally visit one dorm a week and see if people want to talk about what’s working (Ripes) and what needs improvement (Gripes)

Among a whole host of other events that also haven't happened. Sure, some of these things are a little ambitious (did anyone believe class council could integrate stellar and MITx lol), but is it really that difficult to send out email surveys (which he also promised) and visit dorms every now and then?

Maybe class council really is only good for selecting poor sweater designs, and free food every month or so.

P.S. don't mean to rip on Brown, he just so happens to be the only member of the 2019 council that I know the name of lol, again speaking to their effectiveness.
