why do people still think being gay is a bad thing? People, you can't run away from it. Just embrace it and stop missing out on what can be making you happy. I never thought I'd like exercising my homosexuality so much until I gave it a shot. And at the beginning it was weird. But trust me, it gets better... So. Much. Better.
