i accidentally saw your profile this morning when i was viewing my own as public. my heart sank into my stomach.

i have no idea how i'm going to deal with seeing you around in person, but as with everything else this experience has taught me thus far, the stinging will eventually become dull, but not invisible. 

i just want you to know that i love you, and i hope and know you'll lead an amazing life, with or without me.
