I don't think that there is such a thing as "White Privilege". People make up stuff just so they can feel warm and fuzzy inside by making excuses. Whites are every bit as equal as blacks and other races. Are there old white men in office? yes. Are they going to get out of office soon because they are old? Yes. Times are changing and people need to realize that and quit hating on whites.
