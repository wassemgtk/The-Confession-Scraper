When I was 16 years old I was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. So for 8 years of my life I had to endure some of the most extreme pain. I don't like talking to many people about my illness because it's upsetting how I cannot describe what it was like. If I had a choice between going to live in guantanamo bay or having a severe psychotic episode I would choose the first one. Once I had a psychotic episode so severe I was very suicidal but I was so messed up that I wasn't even aware that I was suicidal. I lost my own dad as a child to suicide so during this time of my life when I was severely psychotic I was thinking of my dad's suicide every second of the day, like what he said to me on his last phone call with me and such. I could hear his last words inside my head over and over. I could not sleep for days due to paranoia and thought that everyone was trying to get me to kill myself. I could not cry at all during this time because my brain was so fucked up all I could feel was horrible anger and chemicals burning my brain. I had horrible heart pains and it felt like a giant claw was wrapped around my brain. It hurt so bad. People say you can't die by mental illness besides suicide but that is not true you can die if you are subjected to enough psychological stress as it affects your body and heart. Everything I saw around me had a black tint and people's teeth looked like fangs. The world was a dark sadistic place. People always sounded like they were screaming at me. The worst feeling was that I was trapped inside my own brain and I thought I would be trapped for life and it made me angry to see all the normal healthy people around me who would go on to live normal happy lives after I time when I thought I could no longer continue and would kill myself. Sorry I just wanted to share because sometimes people talk about mental illness like it's no big deal but it is everyone experiences the world differently.
