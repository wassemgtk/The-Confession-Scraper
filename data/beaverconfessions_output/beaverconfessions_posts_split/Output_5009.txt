Why doesn't everyone stay until the saturday after Finals, and All of MIT Undergrad throw a GIANT end of semester party? Just everyone knew it was going to happen, so they made their travel plans for afterwards.

Imagine... All of MIT starting off with an raging pool party in the Z-Center. Someone brings their DJ equipment and everyone floods the pool. The music is bumping and there are pool beers galore. There are so many of us, that they can't do anything. After about an hour, the party moves to Walker Memorial with more music, alcohol, and dancing.

ALL MIT
When: Saturday May, 21st 2016 @ 5 PM
Where: Z-Center Pool/Walker
What: Greatest Post Finals Party of All Time
Who: ALL OF MIT UNDERGRAD!
