I have problem that I've never told anyone about. I can never get any work done, and I'm really starting to wonder if my grades will affect my grad school/employment chances. Surely I can't be the only one...I probably would be able to do so much more but I have this really bad habit that I haven't been able to kick. I've never told a soul about this but here goes.

It all started last summer. I was bored in my room, just watching some Netflix when my I noticed my alarm clock on my counter, and for some reason, I saw it in a different light. It looked...appealing. No, that's not it...it looked appetizing. Yeah, it made me hungry, somehow. I still don't know why this happened, but I impulsively grabbed it off the desk, brought it to my mouth, and took a bite. The metallic parts crunched underneath my teeth. It was incredible. The crunch, the little sometimes-still-moving-parts...I sat on that bed for hours on end, just eating that goddamned clock, piece by piece, hour after hour.

Fast forward to today. I have consumed countless clocks. I order tasty looking ones off of Amazon, and unbeknownst to my friends, I eat them. Slowly, and as silently as I can manage. I know this isn't normal. I just don't know what to do anymore guys. I don't know what my life is. This is what I do instead of working. I spend hours just eating clocks, day after day. And by the time I'm done eating the clocks, the day is basically over. No time for psets.

Eating clocks is just so damn time consuming.
