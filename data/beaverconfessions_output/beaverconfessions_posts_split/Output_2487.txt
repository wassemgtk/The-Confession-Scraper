@5964 I know students are sleep-deprived zombies, but literally no one currently attending MIT has experienced being murdered. On the other hand, when 1 in 5 women in this country is raped and many more are sexually assaulted, you can bet that you're belittling the terrifying and horrible experiences of actual humans around you.  So, no, those aren't comparable at all.
