I had a friend as about my relationship. I'm in an S&M one with my gf. I play the master, she plays the slave role. He could not understand why we both liked it. Then the more I thought about it, the more I realized that although it was obvious to me, many people didn't get it. So I'll say why we like it. My gf gets stressed and for her giving up all control and being forced into pain is comforting and relaxing. Like all couples we have arguments and can get angry, for me the sadistic role is a good outlet to unleash my anger in a controlled way. Once I'm done being rough S&M with her, I'll then be very gentle, the sudden change from brutal to gentle is very relaxing for her and makes the gentle touch feel so much better.
