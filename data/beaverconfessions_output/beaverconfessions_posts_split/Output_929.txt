Went to S3 to get my finals pushed and found out I'd have to OX the classes which basically means I probably can't take the finals until fall...I'm so freaking worried about how I'll be able to work this summer and still study enough for the finals...they all say they care about my health but just the stress of thinking about how I'm going to pull this off is not helping me
