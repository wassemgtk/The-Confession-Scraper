I'm getting confused on the bathroom situation with the transgender movement. Here's my dilemma, you could build a third bathroom, which would suit some, but some in the trans community would find it insulting and want to use the bathroom of their transition gender. The issue there would be, especially with women, some of them would not want someone they perceive as a man in a bathroom with them. So I'm honestly stuck on what solution to advocate.
