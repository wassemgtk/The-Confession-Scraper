When you say you don't like/want kids:
"But you used to be one"
"Oh, you'll change your mind one day"
"But it's selfish not to have one"
"You must be a sociopath."

When you say you do like/want kids:
"Okay, no explanation needed"

Am I the only one getting tired of having to give everyone an excuse?
