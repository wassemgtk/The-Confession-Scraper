I'm on the verge of failing 8.02. Has anyone had to retake it as a sophomore? I'm worried about getting behind on my major's classes (I'm Course 2A with 6 so I'll actually need 8.02) and not meeting pre-reqs. I'm also worried about being the only sophomore in my class and everyone thinking that I'm a moron. I'm slated to take 6 classes next semester (3 technicals, 3 HASS classes) and I don't want to make it 7, but if I push a class off by a semester, it can snowball and fuck me up in my junior or senior year. I put all my free time and energy into passing 8.02 and it's still not enough and I've reached out to every service and resource there is at MIT. I don't know what my options are if I fail 8.02. This is aggravating my depression but I refuse to give up on this class. But despite that, it's getting harder and harder to rebound every time I get a bad grade back. I'm a total failure.
