My professors just moved back the deadline for the pset by a few days and I actually cried a little when I saw the Piazza post.  I get to sleep between now and the due date.  The worst part is, part of me wishes they hadn't so I could have a good reason to spend the next two days deep in a haze of stress and work.  I feel so goddamn alive when my bones are vibrating with caffeine and it seems like all that's standing between me and believing I'm good enough to be here is this one pset or test.
