Real talk again: can someone please share their experiences with graduating a semester/year late? My health has been exceptionally shit since I got here - 2.5 years and 2 surgeries into undergrad, and I'm about to go in for a third surgery soon. I'm terrified and ashamed of possibly needing to take extra time, but I don't know if I will have other options.
