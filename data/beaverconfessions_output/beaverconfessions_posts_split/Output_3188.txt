I was paying for my sandwich at Subway. One worker was helping me, the other was doing housekeeping. A student walked up and very rudely and impatiently asked if they were going to be helped. Please, show some kindness and patience towards others. Being an MIT student is no reason for a rude or entitled attitude. Maybe you were having an off day or something, in which case, I hope it got better. If that was normal behavior for you, though, please consider being a little kinder. I've never worked food staff, but friends of mine have, and customers can really stand to be reminded that food staff are humans too.
