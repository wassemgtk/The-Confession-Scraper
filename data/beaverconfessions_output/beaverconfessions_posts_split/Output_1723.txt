Dear bicyclist I always see in Maseeh dining with the neon helmet and gorgeous hair. I wish I knew your name, I just want to sit down next to you and make conversation. I remember seeing you in the bad boys of Boston calendar and I feel strangely attracted to you even though I don't know your name and have never talked to you.... Who you? And why don't you just sit down next to me in Maseeh d next time you are alone
