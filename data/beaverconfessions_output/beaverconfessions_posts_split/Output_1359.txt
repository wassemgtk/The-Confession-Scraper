I know it's kind of dumb, but it made me really sad that none of my friends came to a performance I was in. It just hurt to see everyone else in the show talking to their friends in the audience afterward, but I didn't have anyone. It's really sad to work hard on a thing and to have no one you know come to support you or enjoy it.
