So many confessions about mental health. This is kind of related. I only copied my friend's code cuz I suffered from so much stress and I just couldn't continue. I know people would say like you didn't do your work and you deserve it, but please please please try to imagine how the amount of work damages your mental health. I won't elaborate on my mental health but it involved things up to suicide thoughts, no drug tho. And oh oh family. I don't even know how I would return home and end up like this. Please please please share any stories on resurrecting from academic offense, and how to talk to the prof about this(haven't met yet). I have been a OK student. If this is the end of all the education I can ever receive, I might just go commit suicide. - Someone who really needs help
