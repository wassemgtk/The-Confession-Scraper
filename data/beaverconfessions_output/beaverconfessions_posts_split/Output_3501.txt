I think I have depression and have had it for a while now. I don't really remember the last time I really really felt happy and I have a lot of the symptoms. I don't understand how I could even be depressed. I have an awesome and really supportive family (but I'm not that homesick) and I go to the college I have dreamt of in the major I love. My family keeps pressuring me to see Mental Health, but I've heard so many horror stories about them that I don't want to risk it. I guess suffer in silence is the better option for me right now.
