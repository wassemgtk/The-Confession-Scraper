I'd like to make something clear. Lean on Me/TMAYD/some other MIT trendy Mental Health App is cool. But ultimately useless. But the solution to most of our academic problems is obvious. Go to bed early. Commit to your work. Don't procrastinate. I have anxiety and depression. I understand that sometimes all you want to do is stare at the wall in between bouts of indecision.

But talking about the obvious solution is not helpful. Just do it. It's that simple and it's that powerful. Just do it. It's not going to hurt you. You can do this.
