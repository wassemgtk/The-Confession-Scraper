Despite being an environmentalist, I really don't agree with Fossil Free MIT. In particular, their decision to put a blue rope around campus is quite hypocritical and counter productive. Fossil Free MIT seeks to divest MIT away from fossil fuel and promote sustainability yet their blue ropes did just the opposite. 
1) Those blue ropes are mostly made out of petroleum, specifically polypropylene, which uses fossil fuels to produce and transport. 
2) The the extensive use of the tape is wasteful use of resource. If this was a PR stunt, very few people had the time to stop to actually read the text on the tape - most people viewed it as a construction caution tape. People probably viewed it as a nuisance than informative as it was spread all over the place and made our campus look aesthetically displeasing.
3) The tape harms the environment. If Fossil Free MIT cared about sustainability, they should have realized that some of the tape they place came undone and flew away. Much like littering, those tape pieces now have the potential to get stuck around a bird's wing, chock a bird who accidentally swallows it, pollute the Charles River, etc. Considering that the tape was made from petroleum, it most likely will not biodegrade, leading to long term waste. 
It is a shame that Fossil Free MIT cared more about their voice than their actions. Actions speak louder than words. Please don't harm the environment just so you can be heard.
