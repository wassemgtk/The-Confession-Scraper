MIT has to up their game when it comes to international students coz the way they treat us us shitty. I'm an upperclassman double majoring in course 6 and 15 and have an almost perfect gpa (4.96) yet i've been denied many opportunities. I participated in f/asip and upop and got nothing. I even got denied from having a misti opportunity based in my own country. A professor denied me of a urop twice coz i wasn't 'american enough' and i reported him; still no reply from mit's admin about the case. I was also told that my essays had 'a foreign style' by one of my writing class teachers and i overheard an MIT ISO official laugh with his colleague about my accent. I don't get why you MIT employees discriminate us like that. The MIT students have been very supportive to us internationals. Almost all American citizens orignate from a place outside America. America is the son of all nations. So why all the hate and discrimination?
