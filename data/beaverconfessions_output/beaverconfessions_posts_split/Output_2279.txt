Dear J, 
It was really great being your friend in college. I honestly don’t know if you feel the same way, but I consider you to be one of my closest friends. This may sound weird or stupid, but over the past few months, I’ve started realizing I have really strong feelings for you. I know that nothing will ever come of it because of geographical distance (we won't even be in the same country after graduation.) I also don’t think you see me as anything more than a really good friend. Regardless, I feel lucky to know you. Anyone would be so lucky to have you as a friend.
I wish the best for your future and hope you fulfill all your dreams. You work really hard, and you definitely deserve it! No matter who you end up with in the future, I hope she realizes how lucky she is to have a guy like you.
Sincerely,
K
