I don't know what to do with 'friends' who think it's ok to delay paying me back (or just not pay me back despite many requests) just because I come from a wealthy family (they pay other, not wealthy, friends back quickly). Firstly, my parent's money isn't my money and more importantly, just because I am more able doesn't mean that I should pay for anyone's shit. We already have progressive taxes!
