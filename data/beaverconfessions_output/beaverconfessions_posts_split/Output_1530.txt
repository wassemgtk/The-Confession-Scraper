It makes me so sad that New House will be destroyed... or renovated or whatever (same as being destroyed because what matters is the community, not the building). New House already feels like home to me. Not even my actual house feels like home anymore because of family issues. During winter break I just counted the days to come back here, and it was precisely then when I realized how much I love this place. I know that home is where the heart is, but mine has grown so much in here and moving it will be so hard :(
