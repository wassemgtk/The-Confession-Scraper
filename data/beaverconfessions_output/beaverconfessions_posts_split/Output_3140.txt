I have a sincere, nonjudgmental question for Trump supporters. As someone who is fairly liberal across the board, I disagree with the majority of his policies and ideas. However, I'd never dislike someone as much as I dislike Trump for that alone. The reason I feel so strongly about Trump is the generalized hateful way in which he addresses marginalized groups, such as women or Muslims.

My question to Trump supporters is this: do you disagree with the above, or do you simply view it as unimportant to the election? If the latter, do you at all fear (as I do) that his Presidency may be characterized by fear mongering at the expense of largely innocent groups?
