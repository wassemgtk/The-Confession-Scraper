Everyone I know seems to have it so together, and I thought I did too, but I failed most of my classes this semester. I thought I was doing well. I'm going to lose all my scholarships, and now I have to deal with the tornado that is my failing relationship with my parents. I have so much to do, and I just want to crawl under my blankets and sleep for a thousand years.
