There's a boy and a girl, the boy falls for the girl (not really he's just love-desperate), the girl wants to keep it casual (she likes attention), and the furor of the dame unrequited for him takes offense and wages wars of pacific-aggression against the girl (actually she just hates her for who she is). And I, friends with all three, am made to choose.

There is no objectivity in this game, there is always "the other side". There is no basis for burning bridges like this.  Why can I not keep them, even if they can't keep each other? Why do I have to choose?
