To #3750. I'm with you, TMAYD doesn't deserve to be on the 2018 brass rat. I don't support TMAYD, I don't wear a wristband, I don't believe Izzy has the right intentions. What does she actually do to make it better anyway? Coming from someone who actually has severe depression it's safe to say TMAYD is a load of crap.
