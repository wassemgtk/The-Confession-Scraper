Ok I understand that every dorm has their own superiority complex...but is it just me or does Simmons have an unusually high one? Most of my friends who live there refuse to leave, insist that it is the best place ever for x reasons, and then bash other dorms. Having lived in Simmons I can say that it's a very average college dorm that happens to have been designed very impractically by some hot shot architect. I normally am ok with accepting each dorm's quirks, but this huge superiority complex really irritates me because the people who I thought were my friends spend all their time talking about Simmons and how they refuse to hang out anywhere else. Does anyone else have this problem?
