Every time I see couples holding hands I feel happy for them, but sometimes I wish I had someone of my own too. Now that I'm a senior, I kind of regret all of the meaningless Tinder hookups... I just wish I had the comfort of knowing that there's one person who loves me that I can return to every night. I know that dating out there in the real world is hard, and I'm scared I'll end up alone. For those of you in relationships, don't ever take your significant other for granted. Many of us wish we were happy and in love.
