6.006 is throwing a test. The test is going to last for K hours. 6.006 wants to plan who they will be destroying throughout the test, and they want to destroy at most one student at a time. Furthermore, for each student, they will roast them until they have no confidence left, which takes M_i time for each student. Describe an algorithm that will output the maximum number of people 6.006 can molest in K hours. 

lmao jk syke there's a negative weight cycle there is no bound on the number of people they can ruin.
