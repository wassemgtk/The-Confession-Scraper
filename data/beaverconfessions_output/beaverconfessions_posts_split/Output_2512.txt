Class of 2019, get your shit together. 100% of the drama at MIT has arisen cause of you (uproars over everything from email spam to class hoodies) and I can only hope that the intensity of MIT makes it so y'all back off each others' necks cause you don't have time for that. You're a class who's dealing with this place together for the next 3 years, you need to support, not hate each other. I repeat, get your shit together.

Sincerely,
All upperclassmen
