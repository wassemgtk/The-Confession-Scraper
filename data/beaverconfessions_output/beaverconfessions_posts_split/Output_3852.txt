Holy shit people in our generation are SENSITIVE about every fucking thing. 
I submitted a confession about loving my girl despite her flaws. I wasn't trying to be sexist. I wasn't trying to show ownership. 
But shit... She's my girl. 
NOT THAT I OWN HER. I respect her as the wonderful woman she is. But when I say "my girl" as a form of attachment and love for her, it's out of affection for the love of my life. 

MIT, stop being so fucking butt hurt about gender equality and get a hug from someone or something. Maybe you need to know what it feels like to be wanted.
