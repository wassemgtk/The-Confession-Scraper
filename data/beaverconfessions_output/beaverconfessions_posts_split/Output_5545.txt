To the person who "treated their girlfriend like shit" (confession #2888), 
I hope you realize how awful it is to be treated poorly by someone you care about. You might just think you're being "hard to get" but in reality, you're just being hurtful and destroying that person's self-worth. If this person is ignoring you and pretending they do not know you, you must have hurt them quite a bit. If you really want them to know your sorry, tell them. It might be hard, they might tell you to fuck off, but at least they will know you are sorry.
