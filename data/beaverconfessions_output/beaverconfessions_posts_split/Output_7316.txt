I'm so fucking done with rejection. I've been rejected from every internship I've applied to and freshman are probably having more luck than me. Course VI was supposed to be a happy job land, and all I'm getting is a bunch of 'you weren't good enough'  responses. I'm tired of my peers doing way better than me. I'm tired of these constant reminders of my inferiority and stupidity. With every rejection, I feel less like the brass rat I'm about to earn means anything to me anymore, and I don't think I deserve it. I just want assurance, plans to have, and instead I have the fear that I'll never catch up embracing me.
