Complaining about everything in your life doesn't make it much better. I grew up in a third world country under really tough conditions, and tbh I've never heard as many complaints about anything as I do here. From ANYONE. Even little kids.  I understand that MIT could be a stressful place, but come on guys, I think you should get your shit together and toughen up a little bit.
