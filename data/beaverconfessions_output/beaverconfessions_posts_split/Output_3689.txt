I voted for Trump. Trump is a liberal-leaning moderate (especially on social issues) who is smart enough to know that the only way to get nominated in this country is to act bat-shit crazy. 
More importantly, a vote for Trump is a vote against Cruz. Who is actually bat-shit crazy and the thought of him as a president terrifies me.
