I'm a furry too. I've dropped some big hints to some of my friends and I don't think any of them were bothered. On the other hand, while I can and do enjoy completely innocent furriness, I also enjoy the sexual deviant kind of furriness, and I have been much more guarded about that, partly because it's obviously weird but also partly precisely because I know there are many normal furries who struggle with that stereotype.

So, #2769, if you'll accept my spiritual company, you're not alone to some degree. If not, meh.
