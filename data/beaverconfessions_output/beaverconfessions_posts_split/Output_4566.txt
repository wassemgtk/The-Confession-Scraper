When I asked you if you'd thought of dying, I was trying to ask for help. I spent all summer thinking about dying. I really didn't need you to treat me like I wasn't worthy of your time and friendship. I started cutting after that. I just wanted someone to talk to. Instead, you left me feeling even more worthless and hopeless than before. Now, I'm afraid of interacting with people. I haven't seen you in months, but i still carry around that pain with me. and every time i'm alone or i look at myself in the mirror, i cant help but wish that i didnt exist. Tell me, how did you manage to not care?
