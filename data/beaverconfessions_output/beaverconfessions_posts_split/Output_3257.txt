People Over P-Sets is such a fucking lie, I used to heavily believe in it and care about people around me but the issue is that no one else really does that, I mean not to say zero people do it, but everyone I know who claims to care would routinely ignore me just cause they were busy or whatnot. A large part of this is probably me, aka I've known from a very young age that no one really gives a shit about me, idk if I'm uninteresting or annoying or even worse as a combo of the two but it's just always been that way, aka I was always the little girl in the playground who didn't know anyone. Most recently it seems like the I'm viewed that way b/c ppl, whether it be guys or my girl friends, just don't find me attractive but I figure that's just a age-dependent manifestation of the general not wanting to be around me that's been around me my entire life. The funny thing is my mom always used to tell me growing up that the only person who you can count on to care about you is yourself and in my naivete and belief in good ppl I chose to think she was just wrong or being sad, but I increasingly think it's true. Anyway, back to the main point, I never really minded when ppl, literally everyone around me, would clearly not care about me over here becuase the magic of MIT made me feel that maybe for once in my life there might be ppl who care about me, esp. with such a push for people over psets. In fact, for the most part, I didn't even realize they didn't care until recently when I realized they were all going to be gone faster than I had met them once I graduate. They don't give a shit and never really did, but here I was foolishly investing care into them despite knowing that I'm just the type of person that it's impossible to care about. The worst part is I've gone through this literally at every school I've been to and have no real friends from 'back home', and despite that I managed to fall into the same trap that I always do thinking that this is some magical place where ppl care. I've repeated this mistake so many times that it can be described as nothing less than insanity, and well, I feel pretty fucking insane. Now I wish I had done psets and gotten better grades/rest instead of wasting time on them. It's too late for me, but for everyone out there, people leave, they always will, but your grades matter more, so don't let people take advantage of you both emotionally and in terms of time, because it will come back to burn you.

P.S.- Please don't any of you dare to suggest Mental Health or Lean on Me or any other thing like that because I literally just wrote a whole post about how I was stupid for trusting people, and I'm sure as hell not going to make the same mistake of thinking someone cares for me with a random stranger
