Will you...
STOP TALKING ABOUT YOUR GODDAMN INTERNSHIPS??? We can't all get into Google, Microsoft, Lockheed, Boeing, etc., and I'm sick of hearing about your absurdly large salaries, your housing stipends that are worth more than my entire summer of work, your free perks, and your wonderful jobs and locations. Please just SHUT UP.
