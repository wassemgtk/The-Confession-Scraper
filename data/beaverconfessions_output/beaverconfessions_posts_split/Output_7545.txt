he longer I'm here, the more toxic the atmosphere seems for me.  I love my hall and the people on it, but it doesn't seem to go both ways. I feel like I only ever see what I'm missing. Every time I walk past a room full of laughing people, every time my roommate comes in breathless from her last great adventure, every time people around me make inside jokes about things I wasn’t invited to, it feels like someone is stabbing high school me a dozen times and then kicking me while I’m down. I dreamed college would be a place where I wouldn’t be left out, but that’s just not the case, and I feel the pain more acutely than ever.
