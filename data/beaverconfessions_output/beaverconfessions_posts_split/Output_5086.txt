I'm actually a high school senior who applied EA to MIT. Decisions come out tomorrow (12/16) and we hear back at 6:28 (2pi?) pm. I'm dying to know if I made it or not. I've even been checking my horoscope for tomorrow for a hint. I just want to take the most intense science classes there are and be a part of your geeky, nerdy community. (saying that with total admiration and respect.)
