You think I am a much stronger person to ever feel this way, so you haven't the slightest idea that every time you reject me despite acting as if you had feelings for me and telling me how much you like me and care about me, I stop caring about living. You bring me to my lowest low, to the point that I wouldn't mind if something happened to me. But again, you could never imagine that, nor will I ever tell you. Ignorance is bliss
