I feel like I'm on the verge of losing control of this semester and I'm not sure what to do. I've always been a terrible procrastinator, but this semester it's been particularly bad. 

Most of the time I don't even look at my problem sets for the first time until there is only a few hours until they're due and I end up having to leave at best a few things unanswered, and at worst the majority of the problem set blank. 

I haven't been to lecture for all but one of my classes for like the past 2 or 3 weeks, and for one of my classes I've never even been to recitation. It started because I had to skip class in order to finish the problem sets due later that day since I waited so long to start working on them, but now I'll just skip for no reason at all. I know I'd definitely be better off just going, but the combination of the lecture notes/slides being on line and me knowing that even if I do go I probably won't pay attention make it so difficult to justify going.

How should I go about getting this under control? It would be great if one of you over-achievers could build a time machine or something and let me use it to just start the semester over, but since that's probably asking a little much, could anyone just give me some advice on what to do? Even just letting me know that you've been in a similar situation in the past and made it out okay would probably be equally as helpful.
