I sincerely need help in deciding what class to take next term. Has anyone taken 21A.302 (Dilemmas in Biomedical Ethics), EC.722 (Prosthetics for the Developing World), STS.034 (Technology and the Self), or 2.79 (Biomaterials: Tissue Interactions)? Please please comment with your opinion on the class, if you have taken it; I'd really appreciate it!!
