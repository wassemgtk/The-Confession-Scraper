Say what you want about Iggy Azalea, but I think if you followed all of the drama she caused in 2014-2015, you can at least admit that we netizens had access to the real Iggy. Drama aside -- my heart goes out to this chick right now (trending-- she has discovered second-hand that her fianc√© has cheated on her multiple times. Iggy's relationship was something far removed from her career; she was deeply in love with this man). 

Finding out a loved one has betrayed your trust is absolutely one of the most painful things a person can be subjected to. Drama aside about her career. I was cheated on too, and I still recall the terrible, terrible pain, coupled with the agonizing insecurity that lasted for more than a year after first finding out, I am truly sorry for the hurt she must be feeling right now. 

I know it seems easier to cheat, you guys.... but seriously, a fight with your partner about sex/your relationship is 1000x better than choosing to lie. The truth always comes out. The cheater starts to lose self-esteem because they know they are doing wrong to another. The person who is cheated on... their soul is torn completely to shreds. I'm not exaggerating. 

I feel like I'm begging and I know it's unrealistic but, this is one of the crueler parts of our everyday society I wish I could just end.
