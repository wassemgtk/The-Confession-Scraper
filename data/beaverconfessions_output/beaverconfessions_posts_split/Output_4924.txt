My roommates and I sent the following message to a group of four young men.  Do you think they will show?

Dear guests,

We invite you to participate in a one-in-a-lifetime opportunity.  Soon our soft and sculpted flesh will be locked in a passionate entanglement.  With your chiseled masculinity, we hope to unite our visceral senses to achieve a sensuality only attained by the gods.  In our secluded tower, four elegant rockets will surge into the chasms of our beings.  As our collective* spirit soars to the source of perfect bliss, the moans will be heard across the Charles.  This will be the pinnacle of our existence.

We have provided a few guidelines to make our first ever orgy a banging success.  Please arrive on Saturday, 02/13, at 10pm, in a sober (or mildly intoxicated) state.  While you may need a little liquid courage to dive into the ocean of bodies, consent is more valid when given freely and soberly.  Experimentation is key to the art of the orgy, so remember to share your body with all in the room.  Hosts will give out party favors, but such favors must be received with humility of spirit.

We have carefully selected each of you to be our chosen guests.  We have decided to preserve your anonymity until the night of revelation.  We are counting down the seconds until the euphoria will come.

All yours,
(removed for privacy)

* The authors of the above invitation do not, in fact, believe sex to be an inherently collective activity.  However, for the purposes of an orgy, collectivism is essential.  The authors dislike this aspect of the orgy but would like for you to comprehend their purely selfish intentions in hosting this event.  Please read the following quote for further clarification.

"Sex is the most profoundly selfish of all acts, an act which they cannot perform for any motive but their own enjoyment - just try to think of performing it in a spirit of selfless charity! - an act which is not possible in self-abasement, only in self-exultation, only on the confidence of being desired and being worthy of desire. It is an act that forces them to stand naked in spirit, as well as in body, and accept their real ego as their standard of value." - Ayn Rand, Atlas Shrugged
