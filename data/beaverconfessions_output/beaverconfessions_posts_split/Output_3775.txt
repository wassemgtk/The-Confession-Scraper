My older brother was always my role model because my parents were always so proud of him. He's a senior now and I guess he slacked on grad school applications because it looks like he didn't get in anywhere! I'm so embarrassed because I always show off how smart he is but now I don't even know who to look up to... What I don't get into grad school either? His GPA wasn't great so now I feel like I have to work to make sure mine is amazing but MIT is soo hard!!! I feel like I'm constantly struggling and just barely getting through. :( If I know I'm working hard but still not getting good enough grades, what if I also don't even get into grad school! AHHHHHHH
