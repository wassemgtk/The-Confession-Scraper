As much as I dislike ignorance, racism, and Donald Trump, I am terrified and perplexed by some of the language and arguments used by a vocal minority of my fellow anti-racists.  Here at MIT, I have heard much more of the latter than the former.

First, the entire concept of "white privilege" is absolutely abusrd.  Yes, I agree that racism is a serious problem in this country, and its victims are more likely to be Black than White.  But how is freedom from discrimination a privilege?  It's a right.  It's as if we talked about having access to adequate sanitation as a privilege.  People with adequate sanitation gain absolutely nothing from the fact that  there are people without adequate sanitation.  Or maybe not having Ebola is a privilege.  It is horrible that all too often Black Americans are denied basic rights and are, say, arrested for marijuana usage when another person in their place would not have been.  But I don't see how this makes anyone else "privileged."  When Hurricane Katrina hit, did those of us not from Louisiana (myself included) have "not-being-hit-with-a-hurricane privilege" or not?

I know what responses I might get.  The point of the word "privilege," the argument goes, is that we should learn not to take freedom from discrimination for granted, in some sense.  I would argue we should, but this ia fair enough point.  But then there's a motte-and-bailey argument going on here.  All too often I have heard these same people talk about how White people or whatever benefit from racism, and that this forms the backbone of white privilege.  I cannot think of any group in the United States who benefits from racism, just maybe some individuals like Trump.  Racism a social problem with our society that affects and hurts all of us.  The incarceration rate for Black Americans is absurdly high, thus creating an extremely stupid situation where instead of working, too many young black men are stuck in prison.  This is obviously extremely bad for these people and their families, but it's bad for everyone in this country.  We're all paying into the prison system, regardless of our race.  Racism against whatever group - White, Black, Asian, Hispanic, Native American, etc - ultimately breeds resentment, creates social tensions and hurts all of us.  

Oh some note: I can already see the comments coming that "there is no such thing as racism against white people, because racism=prejudice+power."  Feel free to use that definition if you want, but the definition of racism that I use is "unfair discrimination based on race", so any group can perpetrate or be the victim of racism.

I saw something claiming that the concept of race is some artificial institution to benefit white people.  I agree that racism is a problem.  This is akin to claiming that sex is a made up concept to benefit males.  Race and sex happen to be characteristics of humans and can be detected by a 23AndMe test.  They are attributes that people have, and is not made up.  Different races have different incidences of genetic disease, and different heights.  They are gene clusters.  But of course, nobody should face discrimination for his or her race.  No one should have to deal with racism.  But you're not going to help fight racism by falsely claiming that any group benefits from it, when it reality it has a negative effect on every group, especially Black Americans.  You're just going to make more enemies and antagonize more people, and delegitimize the very legitimate goals of stopping racism.

Of course, I would like to add that the points in this post do not directly addressed at most people.  It's addressed at a particular vocal minority of radicals.  A vocal minority that is so scary that I have to make this anonymous.  I would imagine this post will receive criticism from people who also would criticize Professor Aaronson for his Comment 171.
