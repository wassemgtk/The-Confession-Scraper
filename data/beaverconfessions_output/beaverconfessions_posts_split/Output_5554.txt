I want to die. I want to give up and go away. I want to reach out to people because I'm so lonely but I've been crying alone in my room for all of the weekend. I don't want to bother someone with my worthless problems. There's people that I want to talk to because they make me smile but we only talk at sport practice and I don't want to bother them. I want so badly to reach out to them but I'm so terrified of the rejection. I'm sick to my stomach and I'm so close to regressing back into self harm and suicide. I'm so sorry I'm so pathetic and worthless
