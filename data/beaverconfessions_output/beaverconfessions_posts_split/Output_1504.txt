As much as I like political discourse and believe it to be a necessary part of society, I'd rather it didn't happen over Facebook. I'm sick and tired of reading "Trump supporters are X, Bernie supporters are Y and Hillary supporters are Z". If you guys want to discuss politics, do it somewhere else and stop cluttering this page that should be for shitposting and dank memes.
