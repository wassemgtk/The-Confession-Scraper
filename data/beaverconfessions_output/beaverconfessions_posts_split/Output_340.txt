for those of you who did not grow up in a family hurting for money:

please be aware of what (and who) you put down or make fun of. i get it, you don't buy from ____ clothing store because the build quality isn't top notch. i get it, you think frozen vegetables are gross and only eat fresh produce. i get it, you think it's sad i didn't have much of a birthday party; you rented out some country club for yours.

i know it's unimaginable to you, but i need to make sure i have enough to buy a plane ticket home for Christmas. that's what luxury is for me.
