Now that I'm a senior and know where I'm going, life feels so perfect. I feel like I have my cake and am currently eating it. Somehow I got everything I ever dreamed I could have, from awesome friends to a direction in life. For sure, MIT has been a total roller coaster of a journey with so many ups and downs, but yeah. Life is awesome. Does anyone else feel like this?
