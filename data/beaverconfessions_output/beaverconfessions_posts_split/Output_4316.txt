You're just a silhouette, a shadow, gazing through a window just out of reach as I fight the flow of our friends to find you in my dreams. You're deep, dark, ambitious, ruthless. You give no fucks and take no flak. You're a strange loop, a free variable, and an unstoppable force. If I could catch your eye for just a second, we'd both see into the depths of our souls and the expanse of our minds.

There's so much to do, and I want to do it with you. I don't even know if you exist, but I swear to god I will find you.
