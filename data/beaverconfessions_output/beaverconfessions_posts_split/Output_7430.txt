I sometimes wonder if I look too intimidating. I'm a few inches over six feet, sport a beard and dark skin and have a pretty big frame. I like to work out and it shows. No one ever comes to me to introduce themselves so I have to go to them, I'm always the first person to initiate conversations, and I've never once had an MIT girl approach me romantically. I've been told several times by several people that I am rather imposing. 

I wonder if I would be more likeable and popular if a were a 5'6'' skinny pale nerd.
