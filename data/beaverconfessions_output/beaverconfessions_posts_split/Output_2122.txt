I get really annoyed when I see confessions complaining about construction happening "early" in the morning. My father works in construction, and he wakes up at 4 am every day and works long hours. But you spoiled little pieces of shit don't think about the workers that wake up super early, working in the cold, the rain, on weekends, etc., that you're complaining about. You just think about how you're losing sleep at 10 in the morning. And let's be real, you probably lose more sleep by watching Netflix until 3 am than by being awoken to construction. But you can't blame somebody else for the former, can you? I'm sure this will be received negatively, but fuck it, I don't care. Just realize you sound like privileged assholes.
