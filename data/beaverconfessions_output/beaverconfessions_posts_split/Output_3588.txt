Is EC culture a circlejerk of itself? I suppose that every culture is circley or jerky in its own special way, but EC seems to have the perfect combination of circle and jerk that honestly and unironically produces thoughtful questions such as "do you like putting tabasco sauce on your genitals?" and powerful rhetoric such as "why do I have to get rid of my 200 pounds of server racks and 30 oscilloscopes? I need every. single. one of them."
