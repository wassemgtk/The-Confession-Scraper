The other day I saw some heart-felt papers around the image of Angela Davis in Lobby 10, saying how their family members were deeply hurt by her ideology, and the things she preached. I found it very moving, I did some googling, and I can see that it sounds true. 

To that person on campus: thank you for speaking up against something you found unfit and hurting you and group of others on campus.

To those in charge of the display: I am absolutely disappointed by the fact that you have not removed Angela Davis from your display. You speak of being watchful of others' identities, where they come from, what theyâ€™ve lived, and you choose to not to follow the ideas you preach. Where I am from, I call that hypocrisy. Shame on you!

Although I am sure not many people will like this for fear of being labeled racist, I speak for a number of us at MIT.
