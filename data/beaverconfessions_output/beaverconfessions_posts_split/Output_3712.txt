Every now and then I remember what it was like to be 12 years old and suck at math. Then I look at the equations that I just wrote down for my project -- with all the giant summations/operators/greek letters and what not -- and I think "holy shit I've come a long way since then." And then I think... "holy shit I'm old as fuck."
