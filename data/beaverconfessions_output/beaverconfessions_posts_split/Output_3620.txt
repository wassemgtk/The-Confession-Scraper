So let's see what we've got: the country is burning down. Clinton's gonna keep the country burning, but slowly so her friends can get their (and your) money out first. Trump's gonna burn the country down quicker, but first he's gonna kick out all the brown people and build a wall to keep the fire here. Bernie was trying to put out the fire with a watering can, Rubio's thread was killed by the scheduler, and I can't tell whether Cruz is trying to pray the fire away or use the gays to fuel it more. Fucking RIP dude.
