I'm just really frustrated with the lack of respect for elbow space that is going on in MIT lecture halls. You have a desk. You have a place for your elbow for the hand that you are writing with. Your other elbow should be sitting calmly in your lap, NOT TAKING UP SOMEONE ELSE'S ELBOW SPACE. Why are there so many people in direct violation of the elbow rule?? If my elbow is trying to regain lost ground by pushing against your elbow, person sitting next to me in lecture, don't dig your elbow in deeper, MOVE YOUR FUCKING ELBOW. Don't even get me started about foot space. JUST KEEP YOUR FUCKING ELBOWS TO YOUR MOTHERFUCKING SELF.
