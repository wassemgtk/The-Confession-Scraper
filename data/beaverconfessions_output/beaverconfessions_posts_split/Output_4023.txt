is it bad that I want to marry a guy who is a virgin when we get married. I mean I don't judge anyone else's decisions, but I think I'd get along best with someone who shared my values of saving that level of intimacy until we were sure we wanted to be with each other forever. It's not that I think sex is dirty, it's like some people are monogamous and others are poly-amorous. You do what works for you. and I want to be monogamous in both space and time. that's not a bad thing to look for right?
