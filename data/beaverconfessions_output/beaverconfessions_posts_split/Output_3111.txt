The Class of 2020 admits have been very involved in the Tab for a Cause March Gladness Campaign. For anyone unfamiliar with Tab for a Cause, you set it as your home page and each time you open a new tab, you raise anywhere between 1/10th of cent to 1 cent for charity (ads are displayed in the corner). We are currently in the semi-finals with Princeton, but it is a close race. With CPW coming, we will not have access to our laptops to finish off the semifinals and for the finals. Many of us have opened multiple accounts and used chrome page refreshers to get around the maximum daily heart limit, explaining how we've made it so far with only 300 members. Now imagine if all of MIT joined us! We would easily sweep the finals. We would really appreciate if you could help us lead MIT to victory! Join using this link: http://tab.gladly.io/?r=11084089

Sincerely,
Class of 2020
