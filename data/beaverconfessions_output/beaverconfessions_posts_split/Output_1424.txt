Two people date and break up. In general, there are usually several nuances to the issues that lead to the break up- beside cases that involve cheating, obviously. Many people  don't understand these nuances. They wanna jump on a bandwagon and take sides... Basic bitches take one-sided explanantions from their friends and jump to hefty conclusions... I see 'friends' unfriending me on Facebook because I broke up with their friend four weeks ago... like wtf? Why are you taking sides when you don't understand the nuances of why we broke up?? None of my male friends have done or do this shit, and this is not the first time I see some females doing this shit. SMH. I am pissed because I really liked them as friends.
