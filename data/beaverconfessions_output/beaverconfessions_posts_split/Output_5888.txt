Before I begin, I would like to emphasize that this has nothing to do whatsoever with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. This confession only has to do with two events I have experienced in the one semester I have been at MIT. I do not have a firm stance on the Israeli- Palestinian conflict. I feel that the complexities of the issue are beyond the scope of my knowledge and experiences. What I do understand a little better, though, is hate, and I am very much anti-hatred. I attribute my strong anti-hatred stance to my grandfather who amazingly escaped Germany during the Holocaust as a child. The rest of his family:mother, father, and older brother, though, could not escape and did not survive. Needless to say, this deeply impacted my grandfather. The most important way he influenced me was through his intolerance for hatred. He taught me that hatred is ignorant and could have a devastating impact if not kept in check. This leads me to two events that, although not unheard of, are very alarming and should not be occurring- especially at MIT. The first occurred a couple weeks ago during office hours. I sat down in an empty chair next to a girl whom I had not seen before. This girl was wearing a hijab. Naturally, I have no idea if she is Palestinian, simply anti-Israel, or what her views are, and quite frankly I could not care less. She's a student at MIT, like me, and she is here to learn, like me. She looked at me, and I smiled (even though the socially-awkward side of me panicked as it does whenever someone looks at me and I had to confirm to myself that my breath didn't smell and that I did shower that day). I did notice, though, that her eyes lingered on the Star of David necklace I was wearing. Without hesitation, she picked up her notes and sat away from me. Obviously, I do not know what she was thinking and maybe she simply could see better further back in the classroom. I did not let this bother me, though if you're reading this, I am sorry if I offended you. The second, more concerning event, happened before the "Israeli Impunity and the Palestinian Reality" event. Although I do not agree with the angry and perhaps hateful undertones of this event, I do support free speech and I am happy that students and faculty who are anti-Israel feel safe enough to voice their opinions. I was walking down the Infinite prior to the event; I saw a massive line of people and had no idea what was going on. I asked someone what was going on, and she said "A talk by Dr. Chomsky on the injustices from bloodthirsty Jews". As she was saying this, the person she was with looked at my Star of David necklace and then proceeded to say something in Arabic to the woman I was speaking with. The woman then proceeded to loudly and angrily exclaim that I was "venomous" and a "disgusting murderer" to which others in line turned to us. I was so alarmed and taken aback that I quickly walked away. I even felt unsafe to walk back to my dorm alone later that evening. I do not know whether these people were MIT affiliated or not. I do not feel that students should be censored in their political beliefs. I feel censorship can create an environment that could be deemed unsafe to students. What I do believe, though, is that people should be weary of when their beliefs transform into hatred. I am not Israeli nor do I have a strong opinion on the situation, and I have not even been to Israel. Yet, due to my cultural and religious identity I was verbally attacked in front of many people. I have not been here for a full semester, yet I have already experienced this hatred. I feel unsafe to wear my Star of David necklace that I have been wearing for years let alone discuss this matter. We are all students- most is not all of whom have played no role in this conflict. All student groups should be tolerant of each other's beliefs even if there is disagreement. But no student should be subject to personal discrimination and no student should ever feel that their safety is threatened.
