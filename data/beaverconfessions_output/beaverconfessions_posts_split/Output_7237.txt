Am I the only one who thinks the Collier memorial is dumb? We don't have a memorial for Daniel Lewin, and MIT PhD student, founder of Akamai, and the 1st victim of 9/11. Name it the Collier quadrangle or something, but a big metal hunk "representing an open hand" (turned upside down, so I guess it's squashing him into the pavement) at the spot he was shot seems wrong.
