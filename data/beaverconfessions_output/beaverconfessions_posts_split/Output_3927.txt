Dear Casie Chen, Your radiance is one of a thousand suns and it make me hot for you. If I could count the number of times I've been stunned by your awesomeness it would have cardinal infinity. I just want to hold your body like a piece of spaghetti running through my lips. Slurp slurp. Sluuurrrrrrrp. But I know you know this already, and I know you know that I know this. I know that you know that I know that you know that you are a truly singular person and although now you experience this through pain someday that very same pain will be useful to you because anything or anyone worth their space was forged through adversity. Your friend "Biggie"  Perez.
