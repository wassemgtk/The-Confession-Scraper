Shout out to the white guy with the beard in McCormick dining. Thanks for making me cry because I wanted to take some ice cream in a to go cup. I really appreciated how you made fun of me for taking "a pint" (2 scoops) of ice cream. I had a really awful day and wanted to cry anyway but you were instrumental in making it happen.
