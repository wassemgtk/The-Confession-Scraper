Dear roommate, 

I know you wonder what's wrong with me. Why I'm always sleeping or walking around in pyjamas or locked up in our room, why my side is endlessly messy and why I don't always act like sunshine when you walk in.
Well, I'll tell you why. I'm an antisocial person struggling with depression. 

When you walked in on me surronded by a mountain of tissues, I was glad you didn't say anything. But at the same time, your silence hurt. The way you turned away and carried on with your life just reminded me of how utterly alone I was. 

I'm tired of seeing the judgement in your eyes when you talk to me.

I'm sorry I'm not the shiny glittering roommate you wished for, but don't you dare judge me. 
You know nothing about who I am.
