It's so bad being ugly. I mean, you know you're unattractive since no girls ever go for you at all, and so even though you go to a party to try to get to find someone who likes you, they will never go be drawn to you from first glance. You have crushes and try to pursue them looking for hope, but then get crushed when she goes for another guy. What's inside is important, but apparently, looks are the first ledge.
