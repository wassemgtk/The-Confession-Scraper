I know we shouldn't give in to the whole, "you only got in because...[insert birth circumstances here]" but I can't decide whether there is any bias when it comes to being a professor's kid.

Like you had a nice upbringing where your parents emphasized education and probably put you on a track to acquire high school research experience, so you were probably a good candidate anyway, and clever enough to be at MIT.

But not everyone who is clever enough to prosper at MIT gets in. There are always more qualified applicants than those that get in. And there is that element of chance for the rest of us. But you, if you're qualified enough to do well here (or even close), you get in. I guess life is not entirely fair, and keeping faculty happy is important.

But I admit, I'm bitter sometimes. Triplets getting into MIT is great (and you are all fantastic individuals who deserve to be here) but when you are also professor's children, it's not surprising. For everyone else it's a function of luck and hard work. For you it was just hard work, and that too after being told what the next steps were, after automatically being enrolled in fancy private high schools and research programs. 

For someone who had no guidance, I guess I'm being petty and jealous. But I hate that going into the future, you'll still have cushy connections to get into grad school, and I have to once again deal with chance.
