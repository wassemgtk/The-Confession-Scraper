I'm an alum, I work on Wall Street and I got laid off today. I consistently delivered high performance and I dont complain about that.

I get on facebook and see ppl complaining about classes and finals. Here is something I want to tell you: if you think school is hard or classes are bad, try looking at the real world. You can do a great job and still be told that you need to go, simply because the economy is slowing down or the company is struggling, or there is a change in strategy. Life isn't always fair. What we need to do is to hold tight and do whatever we can. As long as there is no regret, there is nothing to complain about. Best of luck!
