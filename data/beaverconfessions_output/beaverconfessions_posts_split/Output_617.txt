How do you find out what your (numerical) grade was on a final exam? I really want to know because I was really close to NRing 8.02. Actually I needed a 78 to pass the class but my test average was about a 40. I ended up passing the class (I never felt so happy to see a C on my transcript in my life) and just want to know how well I did on the final. Thanks guys.
