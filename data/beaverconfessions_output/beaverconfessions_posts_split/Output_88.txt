Is it bad that the more psets I have, the harder the questions are, the more excited I am? I take extreme masochistic joy in struggling and yelling at just about everyone because I'm enraged by the psets. Then, I wonder if I could ever survive at MIT, whether I'm worth anything at all, and it feels so damn good.
