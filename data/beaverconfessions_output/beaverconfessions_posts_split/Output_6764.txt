TMAYD MIT. You all wear the wristband, but none of you actually care.
For the longest time, I loved my dorm, my hall, my hall mates. They were my best friends, people I hung out with, people I did my homework with. I cared so much about every single one of them and was there for them all the time. I thought it was the same for me too. I thought that they would stop by my door and ask why I haven't been to class for that long. I thought they would stop by to ask if I was ok, maybe give me a hug and tell me that everything would be ok. But they never did. And that's when I stopped giving a shit about them. I stopped caring and constantly trying to fit in. If you don't care about me, why would I care about you?
Now I see them wear the wristband. And it bothers me so much to see how pretentious they are. This whole movement is really a noble act, but there's only a small percent of people wearing those words know the meaning of them by heart. 
Don't TMAYD MIT. It's all lies.
