I see a lot of complaining on this page about how stressful work is, etc., and how they hate this place. In my opinion life would be extremely boring if it were all hearts and rainbows... Learn to love adversity and be glad that you aren't at a school that doesn't challenge you.
Anyways, I believe that most people secretly enjoy stress. That's why drama is always stirred up in perfectly peaceful situations. Its fun to yell at people and to cry and to feel the relief when there is a break in the turmoil---no matter how long it takes to reach that point. Life is an emotional rollercoaster, deal with it
