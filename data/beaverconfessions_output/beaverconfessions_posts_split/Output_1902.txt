I never realized that having a friend with benefits who doesn't party much had affected me to party less hard this semester, until our thing fell apart, and I partied like I used to and woke up with the worst hangover of the semester. Part of me is happy to get my lifestyle back, and the other part of me is questioning how I could do this every single weekend (and some Thursdays.) I meet upperclassmen who are still partying strong, but did they have a moment of doubt like this? Not sure if I'm ready for the round 2 tonight, but I know I'll do it anyway.
