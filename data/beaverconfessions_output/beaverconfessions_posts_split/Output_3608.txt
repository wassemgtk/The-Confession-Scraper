what the fuck is the point of a fifth week flag? it does not help AT ALL imo it just stresses me out and makes me embarrassed in front of my advisor and myself! I know I did poorly on my fucking midterm NO NEED TO REMIND ME! and meeting with the instructor won't change my fucked up grade either! so fuck off please.
