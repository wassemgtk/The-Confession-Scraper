About a week ago, I invited this super cute/funny girl I like over for dinner planning on having a romantic first date. The thing was, once Friday night of after fInals came, I was so tired that I wasn't in the mood to cook. I ended up just making us each a bowl of Lucky Charms cereal. I think she thought it was lame, rather than cute, and now I'm so incredibly embarrassed. 

To that special someone, if you are reading this, please give me a second shot. 

I've got a two pairs of ice skates, a thermos of hot chocolate, and a small portable speaker to listen to music as we walk down the lit up trees of Common Wealth on our way to the Frog Pond.

MIT is just trying to ruin our shot together. I refuse to let that happen!
2PM January 9th! I'll be waiting at the center of the Harvard Bridge, whether you show up or not.
