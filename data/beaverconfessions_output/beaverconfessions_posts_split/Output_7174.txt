To 1270. I know who you are. I saw you some weeks ago. I wasn't going to say anything because I thought that you would change, but now that I see that you are even proud of it (putting it on MIT confessions), I want to help you and  share your pride with everyone. So I have some announcements with your picture, a picture of how you leave the toilets and a sentence that reads "I don't know how to flush the toilet, can you teach me?"
I plan to distribute it throughout MIT if you leave that nasty stuff again.
Glad that you are proud of your disgusting behavior, makes this so much easier.
Thanks!
