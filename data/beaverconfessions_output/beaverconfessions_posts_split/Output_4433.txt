Here's a third generation confession responding to confessions which was are quite ill-masked petty responses to a confessions about Senior House because we are ever quickly succumbing more and more to tribalism, infighting, corruption, and incompetent leadership. Is it because we're "stupid"? Is it a result of the forced ethnic mixing with the Bexicans, whose obtuseness tainted our preferred culture of quiet subversion? A conspiracy in which the administration is "out to get us"? Or maybe pride has infected the debutante - they woke up one day and effectively stole the presidency and now all they do is yell at us for being dumb. Societies always fall because of the incompetence of the people and consequentially those whom they elect. I heard Next House used to be wild, too. Alas, the spirit of the youth ebbs and flows with generations. Perhaps it's time for the Era of Senior House to come to a close. Another beacon of youth may arise elsewhere somedayâ€¦ I'm just here to enjoy the shitshow
