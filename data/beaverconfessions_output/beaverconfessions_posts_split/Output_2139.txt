My close friend and I have been slowly working our way into a relationship, and our mutual friend is trying to act like nothing's different, right? Then I hear from his buddies that he's been talking shit about how much he's sick of "relationship drama" recently. Really, he's gonna talk about drama? He's BEEN single. He's been making eyes at me since Orientation, he didn't approach me at all when he had the chance, but I guess that's just not my problem *sips tea*
