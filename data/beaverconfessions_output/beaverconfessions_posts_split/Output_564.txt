I just met the cutest person this week, and it sucks to know that we probably won't see each other after graduation. Really, this whole term has been spent thinking how I couldn't (in any practical sense) pursue any romantic interests, knowing that we would both be in different towns afterward. Moreover, when I end up moving, I have no idea how I'm going to meet anybody as awesome as the people I've met at MIT.
