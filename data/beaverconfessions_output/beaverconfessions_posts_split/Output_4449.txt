What is it with this Illuminati meme?

The Illuminati doesn't exist anymore goys, so please stop shilling. All the Illuminati was, was a small sect in the Freemasons that was created during the Enlightenment period. Many of the Founding Fathers in America and French intellectuals belonged to this group, and all they wanted was to destroy the influence of the Catholic Church and abolish the concept of the Divine Right of Kings, basically replacing monarchy with democracy. Once they accomplished that stuff they became a defunct organization, and they have not been around for damn near 200 years now. 

The Rothschilds have basically been in control since they funded the Napoleonic wars and established central banks everywhere. Almost every currency is an IOU to them. If there's a modern day Illuminati you're looking for, look no further.
