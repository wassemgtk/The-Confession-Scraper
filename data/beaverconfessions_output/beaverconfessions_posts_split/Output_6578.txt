I've had the most ridiculous fight with my girlfriend. I'm Catholic and she's non denominational Christian. We approach religion from very different perspectives, I was raised non religious and converted to Catholicism when I was a freshman here and she has been non denominational her entire life. We agree on about 95% of religion. Yet she has actually sobbed hysterically over a couple minor teachings. The first is, she has a meltdown over the idea of building statues of saints, saying it amounts to idol worship and no man can be holy. If you can believe that a man was the son of God and died for our sins being resurrected three days later, believing another man to be without sin is a pretty easy leap of faith. But she doesn't buy that with the argument, we have to go by the bible and the bible only as she puts it. It's "perfect" and the only thing we can use in her eyes. She then gets even more upset when I point out that according to the book of Leviticus we have to execute numerous people for offenses such as touching pigskin, so goodbye NFL. We follow that with taking multiple wives and slaves, since very clear rules for that are also in the bible. She flunked the most basic bible history facts, such as the fact the the four gospels we use were taken from over 70 accounts of Jesus, or that in the old Testament, the idea of God acknowledged the existence of other pagan Gods, but saw the Jewish God as above all. The New Testament is where the idea of only one God existing and the others fake comes from. The bible is a set of metaphors and stories on how to live your life, excessive pride leads to your downfall, treat your neighbor as family, taking it literally is literally impossible. I converted on the understanding that this a great way to challenge yourself and make yourself a better person. Pope Francis convinced me to take a look and challenged my stereotypes of the church, I had some foolish preconceived notions of what Christianity was. I love the idea that greatness is serving others, not being served. I feel like I'm a vegetarian and she's a vegan screaming that I'm evil for eating cheese. Look at allies on common ground, let the little things slide.
