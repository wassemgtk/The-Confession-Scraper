My Ayida story: I was a freshman. I'd already been yelled at by my freshman advisor for having a B in 8.01L, since he taught physics when he used to be a prof here. I had As in my other classes, I was on P/NR, and I'm a first-generation student that had never taken a real physics course. I was trying so fucking hard. I spent hours in my room crying about that interaction, then was advised by a friend to go to S^3. 

So I called and made an appointment and went in to see Ayida. Within 10 minutes, she had me in tears and was telling me that I never should have come to MIT if I didn't think I could handle a bad grade. The more I tried to explain that I didn't mind my B at all, that I was just upset about my adviser and was looking to see if there were opportunities for physics tutoring, the more she claimed that I wasn't cut out for MIT and that I should complete transfer applications as soon as possible. I cried a lot more back in my room, and I did what I was told. I completed transfer applications. I had to go in to get her to look over the applications as she'd requested a couple times, and every time she made me feel worse about myself. I didn't end up transferring, thank goodness, because I figured I had made it a little ways and could keep going in order to not have to go home and be the MIT dropout after everybody had been so excited that I'd gotten in in the first place. I've been back to S^3 a lot since, actually. Gerardo is a fantastic human being and is truly compassionate and helpful (also Evan at the front desk is truly an angel). But every time I go in and see Ayida, I get incredibly anxious and worry that she'll recognize me and ask why I'm still here.
