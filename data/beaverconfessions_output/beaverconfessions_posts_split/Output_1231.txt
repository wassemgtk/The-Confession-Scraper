Every time, every FUCKING time, I hear people laughing around me, I have a deep feeling of KNOWING they're laughing at me. I hate going outside because everyone can see my sorry ass and cringe at how everyone can tell how sloppy I look or how shitty I am for not acknowledging them. Even though my friends say nice things, I feel like they're just pretending to feel good about just saying nice things. Nobody sees me, nobody knows who the fuck I am anyway. I'm sorry for how inferior and unattractive I must look every day.
