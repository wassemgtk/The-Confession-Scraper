Mthembu was 15min+ late every single appointment I had with her (which was every week or two for a few semesters of my undergrad).  I felt that I didn't matter and wasn't worthy of basic respect, at a time when my academics at MIT were a terrible struggle.  I know a lot of people have good experiences with her, but please don't discount stories like mine or #4562 and pretend she (or anyone) is perfect.
