I've heard some people complain that the education here isn't much better then state schools and that this is a waste. I say hold on, you are not looking at the big picture. First it's the name. When an employer sees this name, you automatically get a leg up for a job over the guy who went to University of partying and easy sex state school. Second is all the best employers come here looking for grads, so you get the best of the best. Finally, it's the perception. People automatically assume you are the smartest by just getting in here regardless of your actual ability.
