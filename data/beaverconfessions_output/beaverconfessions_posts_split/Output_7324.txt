If bon appetit does not give breakfast during spring break (also thanksgiving), they should compensate for those meals and give us our money back. After all, we paid for 14 meals a week (or 12 or 10...). Also, why would they limit the dates when we can use guest passes, they conveniently do not let us use them during orientation, when many of us have our family visiting. I tried to tell this to MIT housing and they told me they couldn't do anything about it!!! We, as students, did not looked for bon appetit; we were obligated to have a meal plan, so it is MIT housing's responsibility to make sure that they give us a fair deal. We should get together and maybe then, it will not only be one student's complaint, but a real issue among MIT students.
