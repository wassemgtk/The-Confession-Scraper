What if we had a student-run club here, specifically with a mission of helping out people who have trouble talking to others and making friends? Is there already something like that and I'm just so out of the loop that I don't know about it?

Perhaps better yet, what if there was some kind of online app that allows these people to talk with one another anonymously about their challenges? Is there something like that, like an anonymous chat site specifically for mit students? Cause I want to reach out to other students, but don't want people to know it's me unless we've established a meaningful connection...

I think it's time I admit I have a problem. Right now I feel like this place messed me up so much I can't even talk to anyone, meet new people, or make new friends without there being an underlying feeling of worthlessness, like why would this person want to know or be friends with me. So I was wondering what it would be like to have a system, created and run by students, that makes it easier for people to meet others with similar problems, cause I think it would be much easier to talk to and relate to them... or are these problems not common enough?
