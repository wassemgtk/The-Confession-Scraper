Why do people suddenly care so much about guns when basically no one is killed by guns (only like 10,000 of the 15,000 people murdered in the U.S. each year are killed with a gun), but no one gives a shit about things like smoking, where 40,000+ die each year just as a result of exposure to secondhand smoke (about 400,000/yr total)?
