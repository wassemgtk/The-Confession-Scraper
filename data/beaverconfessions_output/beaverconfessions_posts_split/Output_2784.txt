Wtf #5611, I get the joke you're trying to maybe go for, but just as nobody should be shamed for choosing not to have kids, you shouldn't shame ppl for having more than one kid, aka I want 3-4. In fact, in case this isn't clear enough for anybody, let's mathematically formulate it: you shouldn't shame people for having n kids, where n is any nonnegative integer. Got it? Cool
