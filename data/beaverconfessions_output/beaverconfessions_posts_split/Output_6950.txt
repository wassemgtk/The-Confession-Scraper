Don't fucking play games with me. 

Don't play hard to get because then you're just hard to want. If you like me, ask me out. Let's go and actually talk. 

Oh yeah, don't Fucking wait a whole day to text me back and expect me to remember what the Fuck we were talking about. Not only are you in friend zoned, you're a terribe acquaintance.
