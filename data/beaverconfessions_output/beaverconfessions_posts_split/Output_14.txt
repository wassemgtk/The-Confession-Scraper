I'm a PhD student. With MIT being MIT, I had gotten used to the idea that I'm not particularly smart. But then, the silver lining of this ridiculous election emerged: I'm demonstrably a great deal smarter than Donald Trump (or at least, I'm better at discerning fact from fiction), and if, as the majority of his followers believe, he's smarter or more capable than most Americans are, then by the transitive relation... I just got some of my self-confidence restored.

But for real the rampant misinformation and apparent departure from the sanity of fact makes me want to cry. MIT community, save me. Seek the truth -- the complicated truth (because that's the whole truth). And then help people approach problems like impartial observers -- like scientists, damn it. It's hard to be impartial when it comes to issues in politics, but I trust us to put our collective academic discipline to good use. Because hey, we're MIT. Hard is kind of what we do.

(Sorry about the soapbox. I love you guys.)
