In high school I was motivated and could put hours upon hours into studying for my classes until I felt I understood the material like the back of my hand. Now, I have trouble caring about anything beyond just getting each pset done, so every time a test rolls around I get completely crushed and then feel hopeless. But... I just don't care enough about any of my classes or the concepts presented. Academic work isn't fun anymore. I don't know what to do. It's hard to see my old friends who attend different schools on social media being carefree and bragging about their straight A's... I can't help but envy them.
