I met the most amazing girl at Roads the other night, and I'm heartbroken because in 3 months I'll probably never see her again. She was so funny, had beautiful freckly smile, and was just having such a good time it was hard to feel anything but excitement around her. It's crazy we haven't met before because we've been in a ton of the same mech e classes, and from what I can tell she basically doesn't stop talking, which is cute, but it's a shame we just connected now. Hopefully I'll get to see you at some of these senior nights before you leave for Zambia.
