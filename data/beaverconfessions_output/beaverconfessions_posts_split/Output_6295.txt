Last year I was seeing this girl. Nothing serious, though she kept going on about how we ought to "make it official". Then one night we got too wasted and didn't use a rubber. I found out weeks later she was pregnant, I was scared. She talked about keeping it. I got her to go to PP to "talk". They helped me convince her to abort it and saved me 18 years of child support payments.
