I'm getting really tired of people complaining about the Institute. People complain about GIRs and HASS, saying they'll never use what they learn in those classes. I hear it's too hard here, some of the professors are callous, people are absorbed in their work, and I guess now we're too apolitical, too conservative, or too liberal - well, you probably knew about the culture and the course requirements when you decided to come here, and if you didn't, you could have easily found out. We all made a decision to be here. We could all also make the decision to leave.
Maybe instead of complaining all the time about how you're not happy, find somewhere else where you could be happy and transfer. Not everyone belongs here.
