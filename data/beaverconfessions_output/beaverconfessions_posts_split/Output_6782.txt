It is always so strange seeing prefrosh/ high schoolers walking around campus. It reminds me how old and removed I am from when I was a prefrosh. I had no idea what I wanted to do, nor did it matter. Everything was still ahead of me: a new exciting stage. But now I just feel weary and ready to move on to the next stage of my life.
