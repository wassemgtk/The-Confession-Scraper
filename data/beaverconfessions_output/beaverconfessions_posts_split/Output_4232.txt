Lately, it seems like people are trying make a point by proving that whatever minority they belong to faces the hardest struggles. Each minority has their struggles and they are all as legitimate as the ones of other identities. Pointing fingers and discriminating against each other won't solve the problem. Like, are you going to force a black hispanic lesbian transgender woman of islamic faith to pick one of her identities, because the struggles of her “other” identities are not as big as the ones you share? Criticizing other groups is destructive and divides us even more. When really we should be walking hand in hand and try to better the system for every single one of us, no matter what group we identify with. 
Love, don’t discriminate. <3
