I'm not a  gamer, not a huge fan of partying, and I'm not physically fit enough for sports. Plus, I didn't join many activities this semester since I was freaking about about not being on P/NR, but I ended up having a lot more free time than I thought I would. What do you guys do to have fun and how can I meet new people outside clubs and the above activities?
