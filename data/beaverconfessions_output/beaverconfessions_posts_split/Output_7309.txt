I started dating my former MIT best friend last semester. She was amazing, and she made my life brighter every single day.

I'd rush doing my P-sets and Labs so that I could do something amazing with her.

Then, this semester, everything changed. She would just ignore me, and get angry at me for no reason. She would ignore me, make me suffer and cry, and never say sorry. She really made me sad. We broke up a while ago and don't talk to each other anymore. 

I feel kinda lost, and all the energy that I had for P-sets and Labs are gone. Even though it is silly, I'd do them earlier and faster to stay with her. Now I can't see a reason to do them... Not doing them make me worried, and by being worried about them, I don't get worried about all my other problems [one of the reasons I liked to be with her was to forget the world for a while...].
