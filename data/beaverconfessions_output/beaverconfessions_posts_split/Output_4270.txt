I was to be told what to do. Like in relationships, I mean. I'm a female and regardless of the gender of my partner, I just love being bossed around, even in non-intimate settings. I feel protected, nice. If you treat me like your property, it makes me feel safe because why wouldn't you want to take care of your property?
With all the feminist movements going on (which are great, don't get me wrong), I continually get attacked for this preference. This isn't Stockholm syndrome. I've have relationships of all sorts, and this is just what I like. Just because everyone has the right to their own voice doesn't mean they can't give this power up to someone they trust and love.
