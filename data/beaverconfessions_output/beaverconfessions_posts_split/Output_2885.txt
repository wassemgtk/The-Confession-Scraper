#5530  I'm cruft and I'm 100% with you. Maybe this is ironic given that I'm commenting on a student forum, but I'm going to say it anyway.

As a student, I've watched cruft hit on frosh and get them into a relationship that ultimately wasn't good for them (GFD follow the campsite rule). Even predatory ones who seem to do it over and over again. I've had to talk down a suicidal cruft who was living on my hall. I hope he got the help he needed, but two years graduated, he really needed better forms of help than hosed students, and hosed students are already stressed as fuck. Some clubs are monopolized by cruft in really creepy powerplays. I don't have a good solution to this. For living groups, it might be useful to talk to your GRT, RA, or house master.

Cruft, we need to be helpful or STFU. Show up to alumni events, visit friends, what ever, but also grow up, get some hobbies outside of MIT, and jesus christ stop fucking frosh. There's a whole fucking city out there. Your life can include MIT, but it shouldn't be to the point where it makes student life worse. Or yours, for that matter.
