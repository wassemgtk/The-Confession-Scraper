ost of my friends are wildly liberal, which is fine because I am too.  I agree with them on most issues related to sexuality/bodily autonomy (marriage equality, the right to choose, etc.), but I have a lot of problems with the sex-positive movement and the kink community.  I'm afraid to share my opinions without being shunned or thought of as a bigot.  It's super frustrating to hear somebody give their point of view and assume I agree when I'm too afraid to speak up.  Why are the most "tolerant" people just as intimidating as the "intolerant" ones?
