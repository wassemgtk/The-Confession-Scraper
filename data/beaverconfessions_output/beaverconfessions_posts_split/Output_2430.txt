I fell out of love with my boyfriend a few months ago, but I had been clinging to it hoping I would feel differently.  Last week, it was very painful to let him go.  I'm so lonely.  Tried reconnecting with old friends but seeing people on hall who read but don't respond to my messages hurts and makes me feel like dirt.
