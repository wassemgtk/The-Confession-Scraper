I would consider donating to the senior gift campaign if the campaigners were less abusive and clearly outlined how they pay for all of their elaborate events. 

I've been harassed and emotionally abused even after nicely and clearly outlining my reasons for not donating. 

These kinds of bullying tatics should not be condoned at MIT.
