Dear MIT students – please read this. 
In response to #2672 (and #2642):
I was blown away by the amount of logical fallacies in post #2672. I’m going to address a number of points made by the OP:

1. Let’s first consider the political background of one of the speakers: Mads Gilbert stated the following in response to 9/11: “If the U.S. government has a legitimate right to bomb and kill civilians in Iraq, the oppressed has a moral right to attack the U.S. with the weapons they may create as well.” So when the OP claimed that Mads Gilbert is “both extremely respected and knowledgeable on the matter”, I can only assume that he/she respects people that condone or tolerate terror attacks.

2. A second claim raised by the OP is that the differences in casualties between the two sides somehow indicates that Israel is in the wrong.
In WW2, over 1,500,000 German civilians died as opposed to ~70,000 civilians in the UK. Does this imply that in WW2, Germany was the victim and Britain the aggressor?
Loss of human life is absolutely tragic, but the fact that Israel has far less casualties is a product of its spending an extremely high percentage of its GDP on defense. In response to an endless barrage of missiles, it has developed “The Iron Dome”, an anti-ballistic defense system that intercepts missiles in mid-flight.
The relatively low death toll on the Israeli side is not due to any lack of attempt from Hamas (the government of Gaza): In 2014, ~4,000 missiles were launched from Gaza into Israel.

3. The OP claims that “most of the world's countries...are against Israel's actions, but are unable to do anything against the superpower that is the US.”
Really? 
It seems like nearly all democracies support Israel. 
Last time I checked, Hamas (the Palestinian organization that controls Gaza) is recognized as a terrorist organization by the USA, the European Union, Canada, Egypt and Japan.
Who doesn’t recognize it as a terrorist nation?
Russia and Iran among others. How interesting.

4. The final claim is ludicrous: “In Israel's Dahiya Doctrine, they state that their aim is to cause as much destruction and loss of Arab life as possible.”
There could be no greater lie. The Dahiya Doctrine defines Israel’s intention to destroy missile launching infrastructure in terrorist controlled areas. Israel has a strict policy of announcing, in advance, its intentions to attack such areas, to prevent innocent bystanders from getting hurt. 
What more could possibly be done?
But don’t take my word for it. Look up the Dahiya Doctrine and read it for yourself. Call me out if what I’m saying is wrong.

Asides from the sheer monstrosity of targeting innocent people, every time an innocent person is killed, it makes Israel look terrible. What does Israel stand to gain by attacking innocent people?
Absolutely nothing. It only loses. I’m saying this after having served for four years in the Israeli Military. I promise you, I cannot think of anything worse for Israel than killing innocent people.
It’s evil, it’s political suicide, and it just deepens the animosity even further. 
There have been deaths on both sides. Currently, Israel is under a wave of terror attacks that have been condemned world-wide.
My best friend, Malachy Rosenfeld, an Israeli, was murdered four months ago by three Palestinian terrorists as he returned home from a basketball game.
My mother was nearly stoned to death half a year ago as she was driving to work.
My next door neighbor, Segev Avihail, was stabbed and killed in school by a terrorist three years ago.
I’m also an American citizen, and proud to be one. To the anonymous OP – it seems from your words that you aren’t too fond of the USA, or at least you take little regard in idolizing people that condone terror attacks against it.
All I can say is this. Israel is not perfect. Neither is the USA. 
But overall, I think both countries have done the right thing in defending their people and protecting them against those who wish them harm.
There is a lot more that can be said. Those of you who would like to hear more about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict or discuss what’s going on are welcome to contact me – I’d be happy to speak with you about this.
