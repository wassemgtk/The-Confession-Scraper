I was so nervous when I first got to MIT that the first person I met, I spoke to in a fake British accent and told them I was from Britain. I've been caught in this lie for the whole time I've been a student here. I just want to be true to myself, but I'm too scared that I'll lose all my friends if I tell them the truth. Help.
