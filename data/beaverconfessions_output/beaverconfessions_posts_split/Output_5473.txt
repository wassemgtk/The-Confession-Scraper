There is this guy that is in a few of my classes this semester and I am so attracted to him. He has the whole "adorable nerd" thing going on. Sometimes I feel like when we look at each other or when we exchange small talk there is tension between us. It might all be in my head; I want to ask him out on a date so badly. Now I just need to find out if he is into guys too.
