All we have to do is smile, say hi or something. We then can start a conversation and hopefully be friends. I simply want to know you better since you are very likely to be interesting, talented, inspiring, kind, and self driven (I mean MIT must have chosen us for some reason). Next time if we see each other, do something to acknowledge our existences especially if we are already Facebook friends.
