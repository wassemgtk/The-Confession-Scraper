I feel so embarrassed. I'm failing (or barely passing) many of my exams. I'm a freshmen, and everyone else seems like they have their shit together. How am I doing so poorly? Does anyone know who I contact about getting a tutor? For multiple classes? Psets aren't the issue, it's studying for tests. Any advice?
