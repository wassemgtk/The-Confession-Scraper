Whoever put up the shirts in the student center was really inconsiderate. I have been consistently disgusted at how men have been playing the victim when they are the true perpetrators of rape culture. They will never understand the fear for their bodies that women experience every single day. They will never know what it's like to be afraid to come forward. They will never understand what it's like to be violated and discarded by someone who was indoctrinated to believe he did nothing wrong. They will never understand the pain of hearing survivor after survivor recall when they were raped. And yet I see this rude display in the student center as if none of the struggles of women matter anymore. What is the point of this shit? To push an agenda? All what this shit does is to make men complacent and irresponsible. It literally says "Hurr, us brahs also get raped too, so quit pretending you're special, we dindu nuffin!" It's pure sexism and an insult to me.
