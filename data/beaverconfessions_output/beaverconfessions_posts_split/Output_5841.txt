This is a confession I've been dying to make for a while. When I was in high school I was on the football team. The team did a hazing ritual with the freshmen. After practice hours on the first Friday, we all were made to run with our shirts off to the local marsh, you stood in there for an hour and had to be still while the mosquitoes ate you. Then we crawled through the mud and ran back to the locker rooms where Lady Gaga's "I like it rough" blasted while you got towel whipped by the upper classmen walking by. This was all while they called us every name known to man and mocked us. They got every single one of us to cry, but afterwards, having each other to get through it we were the best of friends. The Saturday after a senior threw a party at his house for the whole team, and they all accepted us as one of their own and had fun with us just to let us all know, it's just part of being on the team and it wasn't personal. The thing I want to bring up is all hazing isn't bad. This ritual served a purpose, to see who really wanted to be on the team, and to make team bonds stronger. I know a lot of people here who would find this barbaric and demand charges be pressed. But, done properly, in a controlled environment, like the one we had, it's no riskier then playing football and helps make you closer friends then you can imagine. Any of the guys from my class from the football team I'm close with in a way of it's own, it's a love I can't describe, but is beyond magnificent.
