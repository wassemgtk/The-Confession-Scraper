I'm pretty pissed off about all the campus security policies they implement around campus. Did you see in the tech that one of our own might get kicked off campus for holding a door? The security workers are a blatant invasion of privacy.

It's also devastating that there's no way for us to vent this anger. You can't cancel meal plan if you live in many dorms, and that's likely the only way we could do any damage to have our voice heard. I would organize some sort of protest but I don't think we could even get 40 students to sacrifice some of their time to fight it.
