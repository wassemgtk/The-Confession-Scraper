Listen. Wake up. I am a junior and working hard in MIT since my sophomore year. Freshman year was a total disaster. I fell for an innocent baby faced girl and she kept looping me around only to use me for her PSETS. We are here for us not for those girls who live in some kind of bubble. Make yourself super powerful in whatever you do. Go out alone and run around Briggs. You don't need people to feel better. Remember in a few years they will go their way and you would go yours. All you will have is a good body and mind, a family (like mine who pay my bills and give me full support) and now a girl really likes me. I am biding my time to talk to her. No more mistakes any more. Stop the hate posts and share more love, you will love more people and get some back.
