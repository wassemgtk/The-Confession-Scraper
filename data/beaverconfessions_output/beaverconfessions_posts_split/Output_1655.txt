To the anonymous student who posted that thing on 14.01 piazza page after the exam:
The TAs put in so much time to prepare for the notes. Many of us found that the concepts tested in the exam were covered in review notes, review sessions and practice exams. If you did so much studying as you said and still did bad, you should look into your method of studying instead of publicly shaming the TAs and the course staff. They are humans too.
