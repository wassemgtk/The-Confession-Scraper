One thing has been bugging me about the Bernie Sanders movement. I've heard a lot of people here claim to support it. But, I'm not sure everyone completely understands the full implications of it. We live in an individualistic society right now. Sanders wants us to become a communal society. So far he has talked frequently about the communal benefits, government paid healthcare, government paid college, large old age benefits, etc, etc. However, he has not really talked much about that the fact that in order to get these benefits we will need to make communal sacrifice. The model he champions is the Scandinavian system. In this system the average individual pays 70 - 100% more in taxes then the average American. Yes, taxes on the rich will go up, but we don't have enough rich people with enough money to get the trillions we will need to fund all of this. The middle class and poor will have to pick up some slack from it too. The other issue is children. When we pay social security and medicare taxes, we don't pay for ourselves, we pay for current retirees, and future workers pay for us. In order to ensure that we have enough workers in the next generation to pay for these benefits we will have to push every woman to have at least two children, ideally three to be safe. Two is the minimum needed to ensure population stability. And no immigration is not a stable source of population growth. For example, Mexico has completely reversed and now more Mexicans go back, then come here. My point is, if you aren't willing to pay double in taxes and raise at least two children, then please stop claiming you are with Bernie Sanders, because you don't want to make the sacrifices necessary for what he wants.
