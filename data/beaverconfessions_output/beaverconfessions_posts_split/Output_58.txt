Can the people who are submitting B.S. like, "Ohhh, the feeling of a hard PSet is orgasmic [yada yada yada]," just please not post? This is a place where we humanize MIT students. You're doing the opposite by saying your 8.012 PSet turns your masochist on (by the way, you freshman have no right to be saying that). Moreover, you're trivializing people's anguish. Fine, call me butt-hurt. I used to think just like you..................until my friend killed himself. One PSet, one exam, or one problem is not going to push someone off the edge, but they do contribute to that sort of shit. Don't dishonor them, and kindly STFU. Kthxbai.
