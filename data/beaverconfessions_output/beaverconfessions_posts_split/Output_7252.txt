Seriously, I hate the UGC.  Why are we forced to donate to an organization when honestly my only affiliation to them is them wasting my time telling me about we do.  It's not that I have a problem donating to the different projects that the public service center funds, but when you waste my time trying to talk to me when I'm trying to get to class or lunch it really makes me not care about the cause. In fact, it really irritates me.  I'm not against public service, in fact I'm in support of it.  But a donation is not a donation if you're being almost harassed if you don't do it.
