Sometimes we get too wrapped up in our own lives we don't/can't/won't see what's happening to those around us. If someone reaches out to you, please listen. Pay attention to those around you as well. It's hard to seek help when you are struggling, depressed, spiraling, suicidal.

For those on the other side, don't let a bad experience keep you from seeking help. I was ignored, and treated like trash by 5 separate people, all MIT students who I considered friends, in the past year. but im finally getting treatment, and i feel so much better. I finally don't feel like i'm drowning. I even feel free at times. It really does get better, but you have to take the first step. I send you all my love :) <3
