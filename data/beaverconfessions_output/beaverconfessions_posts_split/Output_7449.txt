A lot of sophomores are deciding about what type of gold brass rat to get but I can barely afford the ultrium.

When I asked my mom if I could borrow some money to buy the gold brass rat, she said "Sorry" in a hushed tone of voice that I have never heard her use.  She seemed to be so embarrassed that she couldn't afford to send that sort of money to me.  But she shouldn't be ashamed.  She made sacrifices for years for me to get here and has given me the opportunity to graduate a first-class school without any debt.  And so what if I don't have a gold ring to show it off!  In a few years, I will have a nice job and will be able to buy nice things.  Right?

But for right now, it still stings.  AM I THE ONLY POOR MIT STUDENT?
