Trump is a very sick and dangerous man. This is not a funny time. This is not an entertaining time. This is a truly frightening time. The day a person like this - with no morals, no integrity, no courage, no shame, no respect, no honesty, no decency, no limits - can actually be ahead in a PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN is a day I never thought I'd see. He's cruel and he is narcissistic, he's a bully and a mocker. He wears whatever colors will get him the most publicity - Christianity is a selling point? He's suddenly a Christian (one that knows next to nothing about the bible, one that acts and speaks in ways our God would NEVER approve of, one that was making fun of Christians thru all the years before it became beneficial to him to pretend to be one). He's not the cause of this rampant racism and hypocrisy and bigotry. I'd never give him that much credit. What he's done is find the very lowest level of the human heart, where hatred and cruelty and cowardice lives, and he's brought that rot up into the light. He's made racism acceptable. He's made bigotry acceptable. He's made indecency acceptable. He's made utter cruelty to others acceptable. He's made mocking people for their religion or their gender or their physical challenges acceptable. He's made cuddling up with Putin acceptable. He's made verbal vomit acceptable. He just brought out what til now was kept hidden. And guess what?? It should've stayed hidden. Do you  have a son who would have to go off to fight this man's wars? Do you have a daughter who deserves a safe country and a sane president?  People fed up with their own party unleash Trump on us all and we all will have to pay for their anger at their own party. This is not a good man. This is not a decent man. This is not an honest man. This is not a peace-loving man. This is not a Christian man. This is not a brave man. Mocking Christianity, unfaithful in marriage, dodged the draft FIVE TIMES, bankruptcy, talks about having sex with his daughter, laughing at the pain and misfortune of others.....I will never, ever, ever be able to understand how this country stooped to a level so low as to give this man a podium and microphone and a big rabid, blood-thirsty fan club. He will NEVER be my president. He will NEVER have my respect nor the respect of anyone who loves this country and sees this country as being a great one. It's time we refuse to settle and it's time this clown left the room.
