Was at Barker library today trying to study, and there was this incredible person talking pretty loudly on his phone. Whatever he was saying, it had something to do with Dennis Rodman being someone's favorite NBA player and the US ambassador to North Korea, who I don't believe exists. He was having this really cool conversation, presumably with his mother, in the hall right outside the dome where people usually try to work.

I was sort of annoyed at first, but then I just started to become amazed. Here before me was this dude being so obliviously inconsiderate that I felt compelled to stop and observe him for my amusement, as he cordially said goodbye to his mom.

I think I might have recognized him, too, perhaps from around Baker 2E or thereabouts. In any case, Dennis Rodman is definitely one of the most underrated players ever.
