it's a rough time of semester for everyone i think and i've been seeing a lot of stony miserable expressions on the faces of my fellow seniors this week- just want to say we're pretty damn close now and you ain't alone in your thesis/final project struggles and i'm gonna miss you fuckers shut up you're great and i love you
