Basically my mentor for the past year and a half and the person who fucking made me the person I am today is considering going back to their former life, which is precisely the life I _just escaped from_ on _their account_ and I'm just like what in the _fuck_ is going on

This is a person I would have stepped into a burning building with and now they're going into the same hellfire they led me out of

I'm not even angry I'm just so, so, so fucking confused
