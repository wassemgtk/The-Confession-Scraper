I kind of had a crush on this 6.042 TA last semester. He graduated, so it's pointless, but whenever some of that material is being used in my classes now, I can't help thinking about him (no, it wasn't the case that it was a hard class and he helped me a lot through it, it's just the environment that shaped my only memories of him).

I also happened to be at one of the senior week parties and damn did I want to steal a dance! I won't even mention how I was hoping I'd bump into him in NYC on July 4th... but I'm pretty sure there was something complicated between him and that Asian girl (saw her around over the summer), and I don't know what either is doing now, so whatever, I should just get back to work.
