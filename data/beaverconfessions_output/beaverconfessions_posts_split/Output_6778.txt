I'm pretty deeply disappointed in the UA. I don't understand what is going on, how decisions are being made, and what outcomes are being considered. It seems like our Judicial Board has one member, there is no Chief of Staff (who is constitutionally meant to succeed the UA P/VP), and other than Tech articles, the UA has failed to communicate what is going on to students.

I hope the new leaders elected will change the UA because what's happening now makes me embarrassed about MIT.
