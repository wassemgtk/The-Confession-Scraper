was visiting a friend in his room yesterday and he left for a while to go buy some snacks. While he was gone I suddenly felt an intense need to take a shit, and I was too afraid to use the bathrooms there, so instead I just pooped in a drawer he never uses. Then I realized what I'd done and ran away as fast as I could. I haven't heard from him since; I don't know if he's found it or (if he has) whether he knows it was me... :(
