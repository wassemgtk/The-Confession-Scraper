In response to #3439: I entirely agree. An MIT education is *not* worth the mental illness that you may experience from it. Your education may help to prepare you for a great career, but mental illness is permanent. When I was going through a rough time at MIT, I saw a mental health counselor who actively encouraged that I leave MIT and pursue activities that are healthier for my health. I followed her advice and I've been much happier since then. There is nothing at MIT that is worth self-injury.
