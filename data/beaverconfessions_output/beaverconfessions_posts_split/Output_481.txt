@7954 It hasn't even been 2 weeks since frosh arrived, how can it possibly be a 'huge' crush? I truly do mean that in the most respectful way possible, aka I personally know how easy it is to get overly attached to something as a proxy for something else so it could be that, could be something completely different, idk and idc. But realize that it can't possibly be a 'huge' crush yet; maybe in a while or when you get to know her even more it will develop into a huge crush, maybe it will fade, but I hope this perspective helps you figure out your actual feelings
