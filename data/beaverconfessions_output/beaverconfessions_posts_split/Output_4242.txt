I have a constant worry looming over my shoulder. My mom has had a terminal autoimmune disease for the past three years. About two months ago, she told me that she didn’t think she was going to live much longer. The worry that the only person who has ever supported and cared for me is going to die soon is eating me alive. I’m watching her slowly and painfully deteriorate, unable to do anything about it. It’s eating at my mind just as excruciatingly, looming over my shoulder 24/7. I can’t even bring myself to tell anyone about this except this blog. I’m supposed to be strong for her and take advantage of the top-notch education that is being presented to me –make a positive difference in the world somehow. Not to mention the fact that there are so many of my peers who have it worse than I do. It happened a few months ago, so I don’t know why I am complaining about this so much later… I should probably stop whining and suck it up, but I seem to have a knack for self-pity. Huh. What a shame. Well, I don’t really know what to say anymore. I have work to do, so have a good evening, everyone.
