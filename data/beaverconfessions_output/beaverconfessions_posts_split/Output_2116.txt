Ok maybe I'm missing something but did anyone actually give a shit about the name Housemaster? Because right now I'm 100% convinced that the only reason MIT even bothered to "look into it" was because Harvard "looked into it" and changed their name from Housemaster to Faculty Deans. It's not that I care what the actual name is.  I care about the fact that we have all been complaining about how many other MORE IMPORTANT issues and MIT decided to "investigate" this one??? Are you kidding me? 

"investigate"/"look into" = forming a committee to meet multiple times over food paid for by your college tuition with other budgeted items they thought necessary for this "pressing issue"

But again maybe I'm missing something. Maybe people were actually really upset about calling someone their Housemaster or being called Housemaster. Even though I've never referred to any of my Housemasters as "Hey Housemaster!" but instead by their actual names.
