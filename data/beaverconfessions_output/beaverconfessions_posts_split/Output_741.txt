Can someone explain to me what's so messed up about the idea of deporting illegal immigrants? I'm not asking this to make a point, I'm just genuinely confused and wanted to see what the reasons are that it's wrong. I don't have any strong opinions on it, but to me it just seems that because illegal immigrants are "illegal," deportation isn't morally or legally wrong. I just feel like inherent with the word "illegal" is the idea that they're legally not allowed to be here, so what's wrong with making them leave? In fact, because illegal immigrants are, by definition, illegal, wouldn't it be wrong not deport them? Personally, if I were an illegal immigrant about to be deported I would feel awful, and I totally get that it's morally messed up to uproot someone like that, but it doesn't make sense to me how kicking out someone who legally doesn't belong somewhere is a problem. PLEASE do not let this offend you; I'm generally interested in the reasoning behind this.
