woah the tech apparently spent 5000 dollars for a single meal for their own staff of less than 40 people. That's more than 125 dollars per person for a single fucking meal! And, apparently, its less than what has been spent in the last few years??? what is going on? How is this not being investigated? corruption ftw.
