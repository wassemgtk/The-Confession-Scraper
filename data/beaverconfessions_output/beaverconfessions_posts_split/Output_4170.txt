I'm sorry, so sorry, it was a tough week for me as well as a bunch of other stuff has been going on and I know that none of that is a valid excuse but that was some of the context. I shouldn't have done what happened and I honestly don't deserve to be in your life anymore. I wish I could explain all of this in person but it wouldn't make sense and I'm understandably probably one of the last ppl you want to talk to right now, but yeah for what it's worth I think you're the most amazing person on the planet and I'm absolutely 100% pissed at myself that I did anything to even possible remotely hurt you
