I'm almost completely anonymous here. There's probably only a handful of people who even know my name. I like it this way and I have no desire to self-harm but sometimes I think about how funny it would be that if I did kill myself some e-mail would be sent out about how great I was and how much the MIT community will miss me even though I interact with literally zero people here on a daily basis.
