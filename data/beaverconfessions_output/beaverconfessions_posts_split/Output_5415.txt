Fuck all the classes that have us turn in psets or put tests the day we get back from break (wasn't even a break more like an extended weekend). While the course administrators were chilling with their families, we couldn't truly relax because of the anxiety of how we are pushing off studying/working on a pset. Then they try to lighten it by saying, "The best way to enjoy Thanksgiving is to do it with (insert course name)." Fuck you! The best way to enjoy Thanksgiving with friends/family is by not doing any work.
