Does anybody else think all four of these "I think... Will Jack and Nikhil Buduma..." posts are written by the same person? It looks so weird that the two critical ones were submitted at almost exactly the same time and share phrases verbatim, the next two supportive ones have the exact same writing style and initial sentence phrasing as the first two, and the last one looks more like a social media ploy ("like this if you support...") than a confession.
