@#3910 If it is true that the UA and DormCon have known about this for months then it is disgusting how much remains hidden from the general student population until the very last minute. This is what happened with Bexley. This is what happened with storage. Why is the student government so unwilling to inform the students they supposedly represent? What are they and the administration so afraid of?
