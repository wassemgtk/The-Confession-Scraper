Ever since I left the city you got a reputation for yourself. Now everybody knows, and I feel left out. Girl you got me down, you got me stressed out. Because ever since I left the city, you started wearing less and going out more. Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor, hanging with some girls I've never seen before. You used to call me on my cell phone.

Late at night when you need my love, call me on my cellphone.
