STUDS VS SLUTS
Some feminists claim that a woman who sleeps around shouldn't be slut-shammed, bullshit!
It's so easy for a woman to get laid. SO freaking easy! All she needs 
to do is to look nice and say the magic words. Done. Guys, on the other hand have to be 'charming',
tell lies, be funny, have a fake job, e.t.c to impress women, before they come close to getting laid. Therefore, a guy who can do this successfully with many women is a stud. Conversely, a woman who sleeps with many men is a slut.  Using the term slut is justified because it's so easy to be one.
