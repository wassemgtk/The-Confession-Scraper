Gotta love how many of y'all will loudly and publicly idealize, fantasize, and discuss suicide to cope with other problems. Realize that reaching the planning and execution stage will shut anyone right up. Things get unfunny really quickly when you start visualizing the reactions of each person you know. The faces of your family as their entire world falls apart. A confused somber for your closer friends. An existential crisis for those who've looked up to you in any serious way. And the dehumanizing realization you're totally OK with all that if only it would stop the agony: physical, emotional, existential, and/or otherwise. 

I just wish all the fuckwits who aren't actually planning on killing themselves would quit talking about it. You drown out those who are. 

There is a healthy way to deal with suicide. You stay quiet and *watch* for troubled faces. You actively seek the advice and company of friends, family, your doctors when you are having trouble yourself. You don't create more noise by word vomiting about the time you felt like you wanted to die because you had a bad week anonymously online. 

For all you know, the guy/gal/other who looked fine in class yesterday might have a bag of horse in a drawer, waiting for the perfect spring day to fall asleep. And they might have spoken up if it weren't for the overdramatic little shitlets surrounding them.
