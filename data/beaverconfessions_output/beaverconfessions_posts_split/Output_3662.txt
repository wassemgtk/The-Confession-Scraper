I'm tired of seeing students here obsess over people they deem to be "legit" or "super smart," the kids who ace the grad-level classes and get tons of job offers. Sure, those people are very impressive and should be respected, but there's more to people than concrete measurements of accomplishment. 

MIT is an amazing place filled with high-achieving people, but this emphasis on achievement is too pervasive. I wish we could spend more time valuing and appreciating other attributes of people that matter more, like generosity or humility or bravery or kindness. I'd like us to spend less time revering success and more time treasuring our friends.
