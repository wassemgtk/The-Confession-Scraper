I am a cis woman and I understand that trans people face many challenges that I will never face and may never understand. The recent news regarding legislation in the South confuses me. I want to be supportive of my trans friends, but I have to admit it would shock me terribly to walk into a women's bathroom and see someone who looks like a man. I can't be the only person who feels this way.
