Whenever I'm in a big lecture, I can't help but look at all the people seated in the room and think how there's got to be someone in that room who would be perfect for me. How I could be in such close proximity to someone who could be so special to me. How somewhere in that room I could find love.

But I don't know anybody. We may mostly all be freshmen but I feel like I know only 5% of my class, if even. And somewhere out there is somebody who would bring so much beauty to my life, someone whom I've yet to meet.

I try to meet new people. I try to go to social events (though I detest parties), and I try to talk to people, but it's so hard. When I talk to someone new, 98% of the time I will never talk to them again. I may have an awesome conversation with someone (guy or girl) for twenty minutes, but if anyone asks for contact information, it's me, and then it's awkward, and then nothing ever comes from that. It seems impossible to truly get to know anyone new. I also feel kind of far from where most interactions happen because of my dorm's location, so 90% of the people I know are from my dorm. I like the people I know but I don't even have a close friend yet, and I feel stuck, like I've already met pretty much everyone I'm going to meet throughout my entire time here.

I'm not unhappy, I guess, and I know I don't /need/ love or closer friends, but it's so strange to think that theoretically, every day, I could be passing by in the halls a person that in an alternate universe, if things had happened a bit differently, I would love so much.
