Re: active consent again:
(1) Yes, not all girls want to be asked all the time, but some girls (like me) really appreciate it, so please don't imply that because of those who don't, guys shouldn't ask anyone. Get to know your partner.
(2) There are ways to make asking for consent really hot and it's really not that hard. Whispering "do you want it" in their ear, teasing them, etc... not only is it asking but you make the sex better for everyone with a little tension building, and with communication, sexy or not.
(3) The reason active consent is so important is because some people don't really look for implicit consent, i.e. will ignore clear intoxication, resistant body language, etc, and there are a variety of reasons why the person might be too afraid or unable to say no unless directly asked. Yes, not everyone is like that, but it's still the case that this is a problem for some people, and you make everyone feel safer and more appreciated by asking for active consent. And when the girl feels safer she will be more likely to let loose ;) I know this is long but I have had guys ask me about this so hopefully those that care will read it.
