@5755 Hello, 5612 here.  I am under the impression that you are not the person I was referring to.  I was very clear about my emotions to the person I was referring to, but their apparent discomfort to my feelings is what perplexes me.  So hopefully there is no bad blood between you and this person you are writing to, but if there is I hope that you can reconcile whatever may have happened.  Also, just in case you are the person I was referring to, just know that the only reason I want to see you as a bad person is because that would make it easier to get over your exodus from my life.  Seeing as you will not speak to me I can only make assumptions about why you avoid me, and I think the most likely option is because my feelings are an inconvenience to you, and I do not see you as a bad person for that fact.
