I am a female belonging to a minority race and I am honestly overwhelmed and confused by all the extremely emotional discussions and comments around racist or culturalist costumes over the past few days. It seems like anyone who suggests that they believe dressing as a culture that is not their own is ok in certain conditions (ie it's done respectfully) gets extremely toxic replies. 

To make it clear, I have been the victim of some pretty terrible racist/culturalist bullying. I come from a very unprivileged background. And those bigoted and close-minded people have hurt me very deeply. However, from my experiences at MIT Halloween parties/Spooky Skate/etc. over the past three years, I don't think that the majority of people who cross-cultural-dress are doing it maliciously. People who choose to do so usually have an appreciation and respect for what they portray. And even if they don't understand everything about the prejudices and difficulties that my people have suffered throughout the course of history, their intention is not to mock or humiliate.

I realize that this may be painting an overly optimistic picture. I have definitely seen offensive cultural costumes or references done for the sole purpose of humor. However, it seems as if the MIT Confessions community is using a too-wide brushstroke to paint all cross-cultural-dressers in a negative light.

I just wanted to say that I am a part of a minority group and that I will not be offended if someone not belonging to my race or culture dresses up (in a respectful way). There are many wonderful things about my heritage and culture that I celebrate and it makes me really happy to see other people learn and enjoy those things as well.

I may be missing something very important in my assessment of this whole situation. Maybe it really is extremely offensive to dress up as another race or culture, no matter how "good" your intention. If so, I honestly don't understand why. (And I have thought long and hard about this topic.) I openly welcome any comments/discussions if you have an opposing point of view.
