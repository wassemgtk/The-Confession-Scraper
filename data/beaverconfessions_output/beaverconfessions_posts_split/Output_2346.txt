One of my classmates asked me how I'm so happy here and have all my work and stuff together and well-managed. Of course I gave the cliché answer of time management and studying hard and of course he nodded in approval and respect. But what I really want to say is I look so happy because I'm a fucking liar and always have been. 

I lie to everyone. My classmates, my professors, my advisers, even my own family. I lie to all of them constantly. I put on a fucking show every time I walk out of my single, a show where I'm the main character with a big fat lying smile on her face. Sure, I look happy and put together. I have my hair done every day, with matching outfits and shoes and a perfectly organized room and perfect notes and near perfect p-sets. But I spend every moment I'm not in class or recitation alone. I eat alone, work alone, sleep alone, and hang out by myself all the time. 

I like to have alone time sometimes, but that doesn't mean that I like to be lonely and lonely is all I've felt since I started school here since I've failed to really make any friends. And I’ve tried to make friends. I really have. But I feel like I get constantly ignored and pushed out of conversations as if no one wants me around. And frankly if they don’t, I don’t blame them, I don’t really like myself that much either. One of my bigs didn’t even remember my name and at the Activities Midway (or whatever it’s called) during CPW, the members of my club introduced each other to the pre-frosh but neglected to introduce me as if I wasn’t standing right next to them and then when I tried to introduce myself no one cared. 

Some nights I shove an entire bag of candy down my throat even if I'm not hungry and then I cry myself to sleep. Every time I have an exam, I spend the night before it having a panic attack and then when the exam is over I go to a bathroom where I know that no one I know will find me and have another panic attack in there, wash my face with cold water to hide the evidence of my tears, and continue my little lying show with a smile on my face. I'm crying right now as I write this confession, but I’ll just pull out the bag of ice I keep in my mini-fridge for my swollen red eyes whenever I start crying and keep on going. The sad thing is that my priority is to sob soft enough so that my suitemates don’t hear me. 

I fear that I have depression and I fear that I'll spend the rest of my life alone and in a constant state of never-ending fluctuations of anxiety and panic attacks. I understand why no one would want to be around me. When I’m not in public I’m the biggest fucking mess you would have ever seen in your life. But of course I’d never let anyone know that, not even my parents because they would just worry about me and they can’t do anything to help me because they’re just not here. And me feeling this way isn’t because of MIT, I’ve had anxiety issues and panic attacks my entire life and I honestly love MIT but all I want is to not be alone all the time. I spent all of elementary, middle, and high school with either no friends or fake friends and I really don’t want that for myself here as well.

I’m only a freshman and I don’t know how much longer I can keep up this lie. I really can’t bring myself to tell anyone how I really feel. If you ask me how I’m doing I default to my beautifully rehearsed set of phrases that convey being ok. I guess I’m just too used to people invalidating my problems and telling me how much worse other people have it or just getting ignored entirely. 

So, to that person who asked me how I’m so happy, my real answer is I am happy but miserable at the same time. I bury my emotions in my schoolwork and hope they stay buried under piles of p-sets, notes, and to-do lists, but every now and then they slip up and resurface as they are doing now while I type up this confession in tears. But frankly, I’m not even sure what it means to really feel happy anymore and I don’t think I ever felt that in my life.
