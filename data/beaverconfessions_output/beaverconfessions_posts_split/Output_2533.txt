In regards to posts about Trevor, I just wanted to say I think that the community is completely justified in being angry, and is also correct that his post represents pervasive ignorance in this country. However, I think that what many of you are doing is not confronting that ignorance as a whole - you are attacking one kid, one of so many people that are ignorant to the plight the underprivileged in this country. What you are doing is cyber-bullying, and to put Trevor's “life on blast” is wrong. Trying to humiliate someone in front of the entire school is the kind of behavior that makes people kill themselves, and it is totally unacceptable. 

I know Trevor, he is one of the kindest people I know, and I know that more than anyone else he will feel the gravity of this situation and acknowledge his mistake. Make this about society’s problem, not about Trevor.
