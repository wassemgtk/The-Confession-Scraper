So I was told that the "freshman 15" meant that you gained 15 pounds from going to college, without even thinking about it. Meanwhile, I lost about 15 pounds freshman year, plus another ~10 pounds since then (despite gaining some weight back over the summer when I went to the bay area for an internship). I have not been consciously dieting in any way; I still eat at all the free food events, I still keep fruit roll ups and Cheez-its as snacks, and I don't do any sports. 

I think there has been some benefit to all the extra walking I do here as compared with the suburb I used to live in. But most of all, I think I just forget to eat. All I need is a dorm without a dining hall, a terrible sleep schedule, and a lot of work on my plate, and *poof* I can just eat way less and not even notice any hunger from it. Turns out it's really easy to forget about lunch when you wake up and have breakfast at noon, for instance. 

I'm eating fewer calories, but I'm also having only 1-2 meals a day, so I don't think I'm particularly healthier or less healthy than before. Similarly, I've noticed several really skinny guys who completely avoid fruits and vegetables, and who instead have a diet consisting mostly of soda, pizza, and Mexican food. I don't even know how that works. 

Anyway though, I just want to say that having been overweight and now being in a normal weight range, the idea that the latter is automatically healthier or a work of improved willpower is bullshit. I see a lot of people, especially on reddit comment sections for an image involving a fat person, pat themselves on the back for their weight management skills and for being such healthy responsible people. And maybe some actually are, but I'd be willing to bet that most of them are just a product of their environment. I think that questions like "Is your city a walking city or a driving city?", "Is food easily accessible for you throughout the day?", and "Does your schedule have regular times for eating 3 meals a day?" are often way more important for determining weight than "Are you a responsible person who eats healthy food?"
