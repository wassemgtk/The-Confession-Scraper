So playtime is over now right?

    So Bernie was fun and all and totally like a grampa who tells you all those stories about back in the day walking uphill both ways to to school except with Bernie it was like an easy coast downhill both ways and that’s just not how things work right?

    So we knew Bernie wasn’t going to be the nominee you right? We knew that. Hillary was always going to be the nominee and honestly for me the whole Bernie thing was a little insulting but I get it. I get why people liked that atmosphere or whatever. Like I don’t like Phish and think they’re actually bad musicians it’s not just their songs but I totally get why kids follow them around on tour. It’s fun and it’s a complete break from reality right? Bernie was like a vacation from real stuff and I totally get that real stuff is sometimes a little onerous but honestly we aren’t fifth graders anymore and real life isn’t homework it’s just real life and real issues that we need to take care of like right now.

    So I’m actually really happy for Bernie because he was too old for this nonsense anyway right? Like I totally love the idea of Bernie heading back to Vermont in a covered wagon eating beef jerky and smoking a pipe and just kind of grumbling the whole way until he gets back to his log cabin where he tosses a few logs into the wood-burning stove and fries up some bacon and flapjacks in his trusty cast iron pan and just covers everything with that famous Grade A Amber VT Maple Syrup before taking one of his storied three hour naps right? And obviously he’s wearing real flannel not the hipster stuff and also suspenders. I get it I do. He’s like a cartoon from a kids book and who isn’t a kid at heart right but sometimes we have to be adults. Like everyone loves cartoon curmudgeon pancake Bernie and that’s actually the real Bernie which is so lovable but definitely not president material. So I get it and I hope that he hasn’t done enough damage to his reputation to lose reelection because we’re definitely definitely going to need him once Hillary wins.

    So if you have a Bernie bumper sticker on your laptop or on your door please take it off k? We really really need to stand together against Trump here because I read yesterday that he has like 53% support acrosss America or some other kind of nonsense from The Economist which is super biased and pretty much written by Karl Rove. He also won New York. So please all you Bernouts please head on over and join us at Team Hillary because even though we’re super strong already which is why we crushed Bernie in the primaries and he’s going to drop out soon we still need all the help we can get to defeat Trump who is running away with this thing and getting tons of press lately.

    So here’s probably the best way to get started and get on board:
