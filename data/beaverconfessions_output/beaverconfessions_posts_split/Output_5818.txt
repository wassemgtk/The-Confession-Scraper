So what's going on with Mizzou? I hear stuff about 1st amendment, KKK, poop and seeing all these I Stand With Mizzou posts yet I have no clear picture of what the hell is actually going on. Seems like half of it is made up (the whole " KKK on campus confirmed working with the cops " by the black student gov. president is ridiculous, as well as the hunger strike by a millionaire) and the other half is sensationalized. I'm all against racism, but I'm not sure these protestors are helping themselves out with all of this crap.
