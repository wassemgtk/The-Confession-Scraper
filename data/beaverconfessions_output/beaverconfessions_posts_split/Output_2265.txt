I've been thinking about joining one of the dance teams on campus, specifically Ridonkulous. I saw you guys at Footwork and you were great. But then I remember that I don't know how to dance and have practically no rhythm. I honestly don't know how I did marching band in high school without tripping over my own 2 left feet. Oh well, it was a thought.
