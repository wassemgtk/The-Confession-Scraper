If MIT really cared about mental health, they would do something about the weather. Do they have any idea how depressing it is to walk outside to 20 degree weather when it was in the 70's just a week ago?! The administration brags about having this magical weather machine, yet they refuse to use it for anything besides CPW... Seriously?! So basically they only care about recruiting, and then when we're actually students they let it SNOW in APRIL. I am SO disappointed with the administration and how they totally neglect the students when it comes to the weather.
