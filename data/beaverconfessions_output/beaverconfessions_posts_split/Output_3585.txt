I feel like I am in a position where I must feel well-grounded, well-composed, and mature. I feel compelled to greet everybody with a smile and try my hardest to make everybody feel happy. So I do. 

Truth is - I feel pretty bad right now. Severely demotivated. And I'm not sure why, but almost nothing makes me happy anymore. I don't think I feel comfortable sharing my feelings with anybody anymore, even though I've been pretty open about them with the people who surround me, because nobody has done anything to help me feel better.. and I feel a bit selfish for wanting somebody to help me out. 

Unsure of what to do.
