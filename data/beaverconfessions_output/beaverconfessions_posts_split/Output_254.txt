Fuck you, MIT. I used to believe in myself. I used to think with enough hard work I could do anything. Now here I am, switching classes left and right because I can't pass basic shit. Why am I even here? I could have done a lot better and been a lot happier at a college back home. I don't want to do anything profound with my life, not anymore. Thanks for crushing my dreams, MIT.
