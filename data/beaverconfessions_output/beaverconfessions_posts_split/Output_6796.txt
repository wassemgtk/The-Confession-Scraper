There is this girl I really like. She was on one of my recitations last semester. I went to every recitation thinking today I will ask her out. The semester went by and I thought I'd never see her again. But then she showed up in my lecture this semester. Second chance, huh? Except I repeated the same story. Every day I wanted to ask her. Every day right when she stood up to leave, I'd say to myself "This is your last chance. It's now or never." But when you have trouble talking to people even to introduce yourself, asking someone out is a long long shot. And then one day, just like that, it did become my last chance and I didn't take it. She stopped showing up and ever since, I can't stop regretting being such a chicken. Once on a blue moon, I see her in the infinite. I want to smile at her or just say hi but I just walk away as fast as I can. If only I had more courage. If only I could get one more chance to ask her out. Oh and the best part? I don't even know her name.
