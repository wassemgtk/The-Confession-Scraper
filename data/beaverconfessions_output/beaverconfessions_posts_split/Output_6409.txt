I have a lot of friends here who want to see this country become a western European style socialist nation. They think it will solve all of our problems. I actually think it won't. The problem is those European nations are very homogeneous. The people are mostly the same race, ethnicity, religion, culture, language, etc, etc. That's how they achieve such mass social agreement. America is a massive melting pot of every culture mashed together under a few basic principles. That's why it's so hard to get anything done politically here. I feel that if we went European socialist, people here would go back to outright racism, classicism, xenophobia, homophobia, anti-antisemitism as seen in much of Europe where immigrants try to move in. When we are all dependent on each other for a living, we fear outsiders and differences.
