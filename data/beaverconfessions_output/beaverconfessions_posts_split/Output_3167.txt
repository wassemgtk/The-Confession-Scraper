The email titled, "Announcing Our Student Openers for SpringFEST 2016!" is so shittily formatted, it makes me cringe and want to throw up. I wonder if the UA person behind the email is actually just secretly plotting to make us all recoil in disgust. No one's aesthetic sense can be that barbarous. You can send a plain text email that would be better. WTF is up with this one. Can 6.UAT use it as an example of what not to do, and have the students fix it in class like they do with powerpoint slides. Turn every moment into a teaching moment.
