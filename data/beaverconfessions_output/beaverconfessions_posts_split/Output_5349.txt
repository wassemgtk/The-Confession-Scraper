So far, I've seen a couple photos of Humans of East Side calendar since some of my FB friends use those photos for their profile picture. They look really amazing! But I feel really awkward to buy one especially since the photos are sexual themed... Idk, it's just awkward to have a somewhat erotic calendar filled with a group of people you know on your wall
