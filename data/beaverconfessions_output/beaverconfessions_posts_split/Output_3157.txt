#5228 Respect their boundaries.  If they don't want to interact with you, that is their right.  There's not a "deserve" here.  They may not feel comfortable anymore, and that's okay.  If you were abusive before, you should be prioritizing their feelings over your desire to be forgiven.  It's easy to want to reconcile for selfish reasons.  Don't fall into that trap.
