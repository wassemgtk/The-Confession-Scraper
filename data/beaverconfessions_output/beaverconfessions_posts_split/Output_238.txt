@8188 Don't switch majors. People who take the easy way out to become a HASS major have a hella hard time finding and keeping jobs. It's two hard years now or many hard years after. You can still apply to law school, and have a fallback if it doesn't work out. Take it from an alumnus who sees too many of my friends struggling right now. It's unpopular to talk about how different majors have different difficulty levels and different employability rates while you're an undergraduate student, but reality will smack you in the face afterwards.
