After through analysis, I've concluded that handicapped bathrooms are just perfect for a quick wank on campus. First, I like loud porn, and in a locked, handicapped bathroom there is no risk of anyone walking in on or potentially hearing porn through my headphones. In fact, I can play the video without any headphones using my laptop speakers, reducing the potential of annoying headphone wires interrupting my session. In addition, there are diaper changing tables that you can place your laptop on, so you can sit on the toilet and have a wank without dealing with shit quality mobile streams, or having to try and balance your laptop on your knees while wanking. Finally, there is always an abundance of tissues, soap, and hot water to clean up after you're done. What more could you need?
