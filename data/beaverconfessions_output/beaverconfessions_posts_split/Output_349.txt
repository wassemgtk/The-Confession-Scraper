Have you ever loved someone so much that you can't stop thinking about them, and you want to spend all your time with them, but they will never love you back because, let's just say you aren't their type. And you feel comfortable around them, but still they will never love you. So you throw this love into all your other relationships and then everyone just thinks you are lovable, but no one REALLY loves you, because they sense that the love wasn't intended for them. So all you are is alone. But you still throw on your shoes and live another day because you STILL love someone.
