I would be so much more productive if there was somewhere I could go to pset that would allow me to smoke indoors. I waste so much time having to pack up all my stuff just to step outside the library for a cigarette. Can we quarantine off some basement somewhere on campus or something so us smokers can have a place to study while smoking our dirty little lungs off?
