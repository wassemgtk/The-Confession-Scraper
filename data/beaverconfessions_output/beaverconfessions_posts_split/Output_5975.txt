During the HackMIT weekend this guy who was here for the event started talking to me. During one of the times I saw him, he repeatedly tried kissing me and grabbing me even though I forcefully told him no multiple times. He eventually stopped and apologized, but if I was in a room alone with him I feel like he wouldn't have stopped and that still terrifies me to this day.
