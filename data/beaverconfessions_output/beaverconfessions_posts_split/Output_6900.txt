To that cute couple on the other side of the library desk:

I realize that the two of you are having a great time whispering and giggling to each other while you guys study. I also realize that you guys are whispering juusstt quietly enough for me to look like a complete asshole if I came over and asked you two to please be quiet. But forreal tho, except for you two, the entire library is silent. FUCKING SILENT. Everyone can hear you, we're all thinking the same shit, and its annoying as fuck. There are study rooms and shit literally 20 steps away from you guys. Just walk over and yall can talk normally there instead of being straight fuckfaces and distracting everyone around you. 

So please, shut the fuck up (like completely) and be considerate of those around you :)
