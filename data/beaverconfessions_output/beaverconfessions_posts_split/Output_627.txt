When I was in Unified and I complained to upperclassmen about Unified, the only thing they would say to me is, "stop complaining, yeah it sucks, but you guys have it so much easier." 

That pissed me off. But now when this year's unified kids came to me complaining (BECAUSE THEY ONLY TOOK 2 FINALS WHAT IS LIFE), my inner monologue is, "god just stop complaining, you have it so easy." 

And now that Unified is being split into four separate classes, I'm even more salty. When I was in unified, I told myself I wouldn't be the kid that wanted sophomores to suffer just because I had, but now I do. It's a right of passage, and this new way they're doing it is going to be WAY easier. Where's the course 16 suffering??

I'm just kind of disgusted with myself that I feel this way....
