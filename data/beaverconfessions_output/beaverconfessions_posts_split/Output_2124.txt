I'm only risking this because I've noticed a lot of fascist/natsoc sentiment going around lately. If you're living with the greatest story never told, get your butt on over to IronMarch and start doing something about it. MA needs more street activism, not more confessions, and I know you want to find like minded people. Your views and talents will be, for once, welcomed.
