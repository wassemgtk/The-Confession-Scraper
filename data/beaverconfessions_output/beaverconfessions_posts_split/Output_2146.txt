Is it okay to stop having casual sex with someone because you think that person is shitty? Like, there are worse people out there, but to me this person is a selfish leech who takes and takes what they can from people without batting an eye. It comes out in everything, from the way this person handles money to the way this person has sex, but especially in the way this person treats people. I feel like I shouldn't care about this person's character because my objective is a sexual relationship and not a romantic one with feels. But I'm afraid that people will misconstrue things if I do break it off for good. After all, I wanted a physical reward and not an emotional one, so why should this person's character matter?
