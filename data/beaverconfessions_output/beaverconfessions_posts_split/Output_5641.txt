I appreciate how transparent Matthew Davis is as president, he cares and it comes across in his emails, like the one about drop date today. It seemed like an email from a friend. Also I have a crush on him but I doubt he's single and also it's be weird to just go up to him and be like, "I want to fuck your brains out"
