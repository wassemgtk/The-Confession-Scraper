Every day at MIT feels like a huge waste of my time. My classes aren't interesting and will not help me with my career goals and my peers don't stimulate me. It's too late to transfer and I don't think switching majors would help. I sometimes think I'm just depressed, but I'm not bad enough to get medicine. What should I do?
