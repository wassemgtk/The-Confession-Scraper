Awhile ago, I fell in love with my ex best friend, a guy who's currently an upperclassman. At first, he was talking about us getting into a relationship once I'd adjusted to my first year in college and could get semi-regular transportation to Cambridge but, at some point, I think he decided I was only worth fucking- not loving. Part of me still hates myself for not getting into MIT (maybe we would've had something legitimate), but another part of me is grateful that I wasn't able to get into a relationship with someone who'd probably never known how to love me in the first place.
