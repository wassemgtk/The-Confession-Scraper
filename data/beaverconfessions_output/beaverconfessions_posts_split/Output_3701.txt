My Ayida story: I called her after getting out of the ER, and she told me she could meet with me the next day. So I emailed my professors and let them know that I'd be speaking with Ayida, and in response Ayida sent them all an email saying that she hadn't endorsed my request, and couldn't confirm my words. I called her to clarify what had happened, and she was livid. She said that this was academic dishonesty, that I had used her name without her approval and I could be reported. Now, I had just been discharged from the hospital and was already not in the best state of mind, but this just freaked me out more. She told me I could come in and sort it out within the next half hour (I don't even know why it had to be in person, but she made it clear that I had to get out of bed and make my way to S3 through all the ice and snow to talk to her) before she left at 5. She also said that she was leaving exactly at 5, whether I was there or not. I was literally shaking when I got there, and I felt like I was going to pass out. I apologized profusely (though I have no idea what I really did wrong), and she was nicer about it (probably because I really looked like crap), but I switched deans after that and am actually still a bit scared of S3. I know most deans aren't like this and maybe she was having a bad day too, but I'm pretty sure that wasn't the right way to handle that situation.
