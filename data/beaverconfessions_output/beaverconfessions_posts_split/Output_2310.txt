@6067  You can ask trans people about their genitals/deep feelings at the same point you can ask cis people about their genitals/deep feelings. It's when they open up to you or are close to you.  Trans people are people, so treat them like it. If you wouldn't ask a cis person about their genitalia, then don't ask trans people, either.
