This issue has been on my mind for a long time and after watching the last democratic debate, I realized I had to make this post. I am quite honestly astonished by the sheer number of Bernie Sanders supporters at MIT and other elite institutions of higher learning across the U.S. 

While I actually agree whole-heartedly with him on social and foreign policy issues, his fiscal and economic policies are as absurdist as a 1972 Luis Bu√±uel movie. Not only would a 15 dollar minimum wage instituted at a federal level decrease overall social welfare but it would actually hurt the poorest people of the country the most. There would be much fewer jobs for American workers and more jobs outsourced. People that are willing to work for less aren't able to. Of course certain cities/ states can viably maintain a 15 dollar minimum wage which is why it has been instituted at those levels. Then Sanders goes on to say that he would be in support of regulation that would make it illegal for American companies to outsource jobs and would like to see an end to most of our free trade agreements with China, NAFTA, etc. This is almost comedic in stupidity. If that regulation was actually passed, companies would simply move out of the U.S which would hurt the economy even more. Tapping into the global economic ecosystem is crucial for American success in the future and it is a backwards view to isolate ourselves. Finally, at the crux of Sander's economic policy is the villainizing of the rich. It's clear through all the various debates that he views rich people as greedy, evil people that provide no value to society. This simplified and narrow-minded view is ignorant. Yes the previous recession was in part caused by "greedy" leaders of banks but from a higher perspective the actual problem was caused by mis-aligned incentives on the part of the federal reserve and U.S government. Additionally, the finance industry is largely responsible for the innovation and growth of the American economy throughout much of the past decade, which Sanders clearly doesn't know/ acknowledge. 

No Bernie, I refuse to "feel the bern", and I would highly encourage fellow MIT students to consider the consequences of these fiscal/ economic policies thoroughly before blindly hopping aboard the hype train.
