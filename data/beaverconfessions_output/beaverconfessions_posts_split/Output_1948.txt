I've been secretly in love with my best friend for 2 years, and I don't have the guts to tell her because I couldn't bear the thought of losing her. Even if she liked me back, I'm afraid of starting a relationship with her because I have had bad experiences of past relationships going down the drain. I don't want us to date for a while, break up, and then never talk again.
