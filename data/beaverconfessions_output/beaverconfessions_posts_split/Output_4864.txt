I think most MIT students are contradictory when it comes to political and social issues. I don't think I've met a person here who does not commit doublethink. Some examples I've seen:

1. Only police should have guns, but cops are fascist assholes.

2. Evolution is true, but everyone is equal.

3. Support equality, but enact affirmative action.

4. Respect all cultures, but Christians are stupid.

5. The death penalty is wrong, but abortion is okay.

6. Capitalism is evil, but check out my new iPhone!

7. Oppression of women is wrong, but Islamists are freedom fighters.

Why is it that people can hold these contradictory viewpoints? I don't understand if it's because most people are ignorant or if they don't care enough to think these things through.
