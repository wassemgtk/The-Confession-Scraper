@5964 who said, "That 6.006 exam killed me...
- That's nothing to be joked about, there are people that actually get killed everyday!
That's how ridiculous y'all sound"

The difference is that no one thinks getting killed is trivial. Also it happens to everyone, it's life's great equalizer. 

People make getting raped seem trivial all the time. "So what, like you had sex, and regretted it?" That really hurts.

That's why it's not okay to use getting raped as a joke.

In a similar fashion, it would be okay to say, "oh man, that test killed me," but it would not be okay to say, "oh man, that test gassed me in Auschwitz" or "oh man, that test lynched me like they do down south" or "oh man, that test hit me like a Muslim jihadist hitting the World Trade Center." Those last three statements aren't funny, because they don't happen to everyone. They're specific to certain groups of people that got hurt by other people.
