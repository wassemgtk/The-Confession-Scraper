I'm a big public speaker, I've been doing lots of events, conferences, etc. I used to really like it. 6.UAT is making me dislike public speaking and feel less confident. I worked really hard to get to where I was pre-UAT, and UAT just drills in that I can get better and improve with more practice and makes me more focused on not little details that really don't matter because that's what my TA likes to look for. Fuck that. I have 0 desire to do this shit.
