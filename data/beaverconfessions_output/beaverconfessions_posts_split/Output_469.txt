Last year, my friends got bored & made me download Tinder, and we found a grad student in my major and swiped right. I freaked out because I was worried he might end up being a TA for one of my classes at some point, but we ended up matching and chatting a bit. Of course, when I looked over the syllabus for one of my classes this semester, his name was there in the list of TAs !! My class is tiny i'M SO SCARED there is no way to avoid him what to I do??!
