At the beginning of the semester, I finally said screw it and changed my major to what I love instead of what might land me a job. That coupled with a lighter courseload has allowed me to feel actually...happy. I'd forgotten what it's like to not be stressed 24/7. I'd forgotten what it's like to be grateful to go here. But after three years of stress, misery, depression, and failure, I can finally say IHTFP.
