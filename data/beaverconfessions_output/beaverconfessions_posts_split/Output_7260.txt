The most valuable lesson I've learned in college (so far) is that the key to moving forward is learning when to take a step back. Taking the extra time to introspect allows you to better visualize your future, and it often lets you explore doors to amazing possibilities you might never have considered otherwise. To all my fellow peers who have ever felt hopelessly behind or incompetent in TFP in any way, I encourage you to treat your MIT experience (and beyond) not as a race, but as a marathon. It's been said before, but truly each and every one of you is here for a reason-- not just for what you've accomplished, but for your potential. If you take the time to appreciate and believe in your own potential, no firehose will ever be powerful enough to knock you down.
