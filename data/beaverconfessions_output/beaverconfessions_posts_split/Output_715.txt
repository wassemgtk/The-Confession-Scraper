I was only 9 years old. I loved Donald Trump so much. I had all the merchandise. Every night I pray to Trump, thanking him for deporting illegal immigrants. "Trump is Love" I say, "Trump is life." My dad hears me and calls me a racist. I knew he was jealous of my devotion for Donald Trump. I call him a cunt. He slaps me and sends me to bed. I'm crying now, and my face hurts. I feel a warmth approach me. It was Donald Trump. I'm so happy. He whispers in my ear "We need to build a wall." He then gets me out of bed and reaches in his pocket. I'm ready. I open my wallet for Donald. He gives me a small loan of a million dollars. It hurts so much, but I do it for Donald. I feel my wallet tearing as he puts the money in. He roars a mighty roar, as he fills up my wallet. My dad walks in. Donald Trump looks him straight in the eye and says "You're fired." Trump leaves through my window. Trump is love. Trump is life.
