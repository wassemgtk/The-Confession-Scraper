I've been seeing a weird misunderstanding of tolerance amongst my friends. They all claim to be very tolerant people. I asked one how do. He said for example he was very tolerant of gay people. I asked if he liked gay people and he said of course! That's not tolerance. Tolerance is putting up with people you do not like. For example I tolerate the Westboro Baptist church. I don't like them but I let them do their work in peace.
