My qualms with SHAC or DormCon or UA Council is simple - they do not represent us. The administration reaches out to them thinking that theses individuals have the mandate of the people, by definition of their position, and that suffices as "student input," but that's simply not true.

Please, someone comment on this with the non-white Dorm Presidents.
