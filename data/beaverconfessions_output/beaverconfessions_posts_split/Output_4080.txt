My insides are trying to murder me, I'm pretty sure from drinking milk tea from LaVerde's (don't do it!). I have a presentation to do today, and then an essay due on the same day as a midterm in two days, but all I want to do is stay in bed. And because of that, it's actually so much easier to just do the stuff on time than go to urgent care for something I know will pass soon, then go to S^3, then email and negotiate with all my professors, just so I can do the work a couple days later. It's weird how much work it takes to say that you can't do work because you're sick.
