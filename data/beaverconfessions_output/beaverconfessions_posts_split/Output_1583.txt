I have been going to MIT Mental Health for most of this semester and recently started on a medication to treat depression, but I don't talk to my friends (specifically those who I know also have depression; I want to ask about their experience with meds) about it because of the timing of it all. I remember from semesters past that people complain about "fakers" who go to S^3 or Mental Health only at the end of the semester as some sort of excuse, but this is legitimate for me. I don't want to seem as though I am faking anything to my friends, so I instead fake that everything is perfect.
