I really hope that people don't hold me to the promises I make while drunk. 
I also really need to stop letting myself make decisions while drunk.
It's not that I say things I know I don't mean, or that I make promises that I don't want to keep, it's just that drunk me tends to overestimate sober me's capabilities, as well as overestimate her ability to remember the things drunk me has said. 
sorry everyone <3
