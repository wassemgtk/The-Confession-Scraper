Before heading out for the break, I asked my UROP supervisor to please find out what's wrong with my access to the lab.  I used to have access, but then about a year ago it was shut off and hasn't been turned on since (even though I still have been UROPing).  I still manage to get inside, even without tailgating people.  He responded with "So you've been essentially breaking in all of this time?".  Well, when you put it that way....
