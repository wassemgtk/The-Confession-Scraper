I don't walk around and tell people that I am a first generation and I have been working really hard to get straight As at MIT. When people approached me saying how they punted the psets and still managed to get an A and used personal relationships to get a great internship, it just made me upset. But when I think of all the things that my family has done to put me into this school, I can't ask for more.
