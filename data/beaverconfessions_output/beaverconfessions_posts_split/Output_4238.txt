MIT broke me. Before I came to grad school, I was a happy, confident, care-free person with many friends. Now I struggle daily with self-doubt, fear, anxiety, guilt, loneliness and a fatal apathy for everything I do. Even going to my office every day requires an immense effort, because there I will be surrounded by so many people who work harder than I do and are genuinely passionate about their work. I have few friends, and I’ve grown accustomed to solitude because I have neither the energy nor the patience for social contact. On top of that, add the pain of a long-distance relationship. Last year, antidepressants saved me from the abyss of depression. But now, I’m on the highest dose I’ve ever been on, and I’m slipping back helplessly. I don’t know if I can make it through the next four years. I could leave MIT and start a new life, but thanks to my time here, I can see myself succeeding at nothing. All my life I’ve believed that suicide was the last thing I’d ever do, but as my love for life wanes, I’m starting to feel less and less certain.
