I keep having this recurring issue with some guys. Take the other day, I was at the gym in the shower after my workout and there's another guy there. We say hi briefly and talk a little. Just friendly conversation, then all of a sudden he's sucking my cock! I'm not gay and I have nothing against gay people, but what gives? And then it happened again in my dorm, just chatting up a dude, chilling, and then out of nowhere he sucks my cock! Do I look like a guy who wants other guys to suck my cock? I've tried to intimidate and scares the guys off by wearing a black leather studded thong and pulling out and ejaculating all over their faces and chest when I'm done, but that only gets them more excited! I don't know what to do.
