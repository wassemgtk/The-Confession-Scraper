Sigh. Honestly, I want to punch someone whenever I hear DON'T VOTE. When you don't vote, you are letting politicians know that you don't care about what they do. Voting is our way of showing them "Don't fuck with our tax money. It's not yours. It's for us. Also, do your fucking job." At the end of the day, their bosses (more like should be) us, citizens. When you vote, you are telling them you are watching. Without YOUR vote, they can't get anywhere. 

But I also understand that you feel frustrated because I felt and still feel exactly like that. It's hard to keep up with politics when you have so many things on your hand. Also, thinking about voting critically is good, but please just please don't give up. It's a country YOU live in. If you really think voting for a candidate is stupid, at least just show up. Don't vote but still register, so they know that there are people out there who care but can't make a decision for whatever reason. That will at least help to bring up an issue that there's something wrong with politics. If people don't care about what goes on in your country, history repeatedly tells us, there's no bright future.
