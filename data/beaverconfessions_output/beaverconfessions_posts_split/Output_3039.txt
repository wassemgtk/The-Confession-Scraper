to the post about "stud vs. sluts": how difficult it is to be a "stud" vs a "slut" is irrelevant to the issue at hand. The problem with the negative connotations of the word "slut" is that it implies that sex is inherently bad, as if having a lot of sex reduces a person's value. This should not be true for any gender, as sex (as long as it is safe and mutually consensual) is not a bad thing.
