I have a friend on a varsity team I've been spending a lot of time with lately but I think his varsity teammates probably wonder why he even hangs out with me. I think I'm bringing down his "coolness" and I don't want his teammates to think differently of him. Should I just stay away from games and the team? They probably think I'm a charity case.
