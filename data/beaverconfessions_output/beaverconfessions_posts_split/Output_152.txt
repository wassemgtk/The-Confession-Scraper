I have a huge crush on you but I also really admire you as a role model... so I am feeling quite conflicted. I'm terrified of telling you about my crush, getting to know you better, and finding out that you're not as much of a role model as I thought you were. But part of me also wants to confirm that you're also an imperfect human,and I'd crush on you even harder for that.
