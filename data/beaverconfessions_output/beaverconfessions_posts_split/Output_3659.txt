I just spent nearly 30 hours working on one class this weekend. I haven't even really been procrastinating, there was just that much fucking work to do. Whoever thought that 6 hours of class plus 3 hours of pre lab, 6 hours of post lab each week, and an outside research project is only a 12 unit class clearly can't do math...
