Do people actually like go over their psets and exams with the solution keys and stuff after they get them back? Professors send out emails saying solution keys have been posted and all the time I see people asking on piazza when solutions will be made available or where they can pick up their graded psets or exams, so it seems like that must be important to people. Am I the only one who will look over my pset for like 5 seconds if I happen to be in class when it's handed back and then just forget about it? Aside from that I only even acknowledge the existence of past psets and exams if I remember a specific problem being relevant to one I'm currently working on. Hell, I don't even have any idea what my scores were on both midterms for one of my classes this semester and I don't really see any reason why I'd put in the effort of trying to find out lol.

(p.s. this isn't meant to be some kind of bragging about how little I care and/or try type post because I know I would definitely benefit from reviewing psets and exams, but I honestly just don't give enough of a shit to actually do it and I want to see if there's anyone else out there who is similarly apathetic.)
