Earlier this week I met a guy on tinder, we go out have a few drinks, things are going well, so we head over to his place. The sex is good, and he's feeling a bit dirty, so who I am to not join the party? He asks to cum on my face, and I let him, and he offers to lead me to the bathroom to clean up since I can't open my eyes. I think what a gentleman. At that moment he takes the opportunity to smash a taco in my face. Blinded and covered by ejaculate, sour cream, chili, hot sauce, cheddar cheese, ground beef, and guacamole, he offers to actually lead me to the bathroom to clean up. I should have known better. As he lead me into the hall I forgot to remember the stair case. As I slipped and tumbled down the stairs head first I head him yell, "Avalanche Amigos!". As I lay naked at the bottom of the stairs covered in a variety of Mexican foods, ejaculate, and every bone in my body aching I realized he just pulled a sex position called the "Mexican Avalanche" on me. Not my worst Tuesday night.
