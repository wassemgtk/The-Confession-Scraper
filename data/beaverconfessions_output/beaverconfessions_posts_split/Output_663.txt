I had massive panic attacks after having some prolonged illness near finals, and I had to OX two classes, even though I had decent A's in both. The worst I could get at this point is a B in those two, and I did well in my other classes. 
Is an OX really worse than other grades? I mentally, and somewhat physically, was incapable of taking an exam, and at this point I at least have a chance at a good GPA. I wasn't really thinking about the long-term outcome, but now that I'm better, I guess I should ask.
