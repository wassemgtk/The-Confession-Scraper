Really enjoying the unintentional comedy coming out of the race protesters on other campuses. They decry the institutions as racist and want to give them the power to silence protesters, not seeing the inherent danger in that. My personal favorite is the complaints about the lack of minority faculty and how they need faculty who "represent them", along with safe spaces for minorities and in some cases minorities only on campus. How long do you think it will be before the SJW crowd goes full circle and demands "separate but equal" facilities for white students and students of color?
