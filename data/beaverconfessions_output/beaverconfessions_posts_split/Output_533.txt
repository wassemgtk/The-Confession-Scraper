I took to studying some economics and politics this summer in light of the election and it dawned on me. I have no honest idea of how our economy fully works, and a shrewd, but not fantastic idea of how our political system works. I should not vote on something I don't comprehend. Is it my right? Yes. It's also my right not to vote. I know some people get very upset at this idea and say we should all vote, but should we? If a man was having a heart attack and I ran up to him on the street and his wife turned to me and asked if I was a doctor and I said no, but I'll still try to save him. She would angrily say get back and call a real doctor, not, "Thanks! I'm so glad you care!" Perhaps we should apply the same logic towards politics. Because of this I am choosing not to vote this year. In the last election I just voted for the guy I liked and his party down the line with no idea of what he actually wanted to do in office, which in hindsight was very stupid. Some people would argue that almost everyone falls into this category so I should just go vote anyway. Two wrongs don't make a right, and the enemy of my enemy is not my friend. I'm not going to do something stupid because everyone else is. So my advice to everyone is this. If you really don't know anything about politics or economics, please don't vote, you are not helping, you are only a part of the problem. And don't do it because your activist friends push you to do it.
