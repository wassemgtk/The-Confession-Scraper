there's this girl I know who hates her boyfriend, but is just stringing him along since she just likes the thought of having a boyfriend (she even said this). He is clearly way more dedicated than her, and even though they broke up and got back together (twice!) he would be heartbroken to see her go. I want to tell him that he has no future with her and should move on ASAP, but I'd be causing collateral damage to the people I heard the rumors from.
