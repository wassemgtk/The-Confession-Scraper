I feel like my life is just endless psets now. Everyday after classes is spent just working on the weekly psets I have, just to keep up. It's gotten to the point where I don't even know what I like to do anymore. I'm so tired, but it's not like I really have the choice of not doing them without repercussion. Sorry for the rambling/whining, it just feels as though I've lost whatever ambition and motivation I had left, forgotten the point of life (if there ever was one to begin with?).
