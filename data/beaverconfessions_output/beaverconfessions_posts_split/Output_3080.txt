The moral thing to do when you catch someone cheating is nothing at all.

Exams are just a pointless game we all have to play so that when all of the academic work we do here over the course of 4 years gets condensed down to a number between 0 and 5, hopefully our score is close enough to 5 for us to be deemed worthy of a job offer. Whether someone cheats or not has no effect on your life or potential for success, and the punishments for things related to academic integrity are so harsh they hardly fit the "crime" of cheating.

Most importantly however, you shouldn't say anything because, as we all know, snitches get stitches
