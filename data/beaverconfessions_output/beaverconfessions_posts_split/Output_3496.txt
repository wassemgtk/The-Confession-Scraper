There's something I've noticed in abortion debates. Pro-choicers in arguments with pro-lifers always bring up how banning abortions would be an attack on women's rights in the form of denying them bodily autonomy, place women who can't support children in poverty, further traumatize pregnant rape survivors, etc. Now as a pro-choicer, I believe that these are absolutely important, legitimate issues. However, in the specific context of an argument with a pro-lifer, bringing any of that up is utterly irrelevant. Why? Because the other person literally believes that abortion is baby murder. They are not going to consider baby murder to be a human right. They are not going to think subjecting someone to poverty is worse than baby murder. Even the prospect of traumatizing rape survivors, horrible as that is, pales in comparison to baby murder. What should actually be the main point in an argument like this is the issue of personhood - what it is and when it begins, that aborted fetuses are not persons. If you're gonna attempt the almost insurmountable task of convincing someone on the other side of an issue as controversial as abortion to your side, you should at least first and foremost fully and truly understand how they think.
