I'm not course 6, but one of my favorite things to do ever is code while high. It's incredibly satisfying even when I'm working on tedious data processing stuff. I've been smoking and coding all afternoon and 9 hours of working went by in what felt like an hour or two. Idk if it's like this for most people but I highly recommend trying it.
