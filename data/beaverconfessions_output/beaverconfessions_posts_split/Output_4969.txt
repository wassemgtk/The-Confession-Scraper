In response to #3460, I don't know what other occasion you don't want to describe, but people can help you. You can talk to someone about what happened to you, many people think that would make things better; you can also just ignore it like I chose to.
Since I was little I received unwanted attention from many people, from little things, such as some guy showed me his penis before I was 10, to something worse. But there was one particular guy, who would kiss me against my will on many occasions. The first time it happened, I was 12 and I got angry and punched him in the face. Everyone around me said that I overreacted and really nothing was wrong, so since then I never cared when someone kissed me or touched me when I didn't want to. Since then I got angry one more time: when I was 14, one guy, whom I was really close with and trusted a lot, held me down for another guy because it was just a game or at least started as a truth or dare. This past summer a guy got me drunk to have sex with me. He was holding me down on a bed with the weight of his body, and as I was resisting and asking him to stop, he was just laughing and telling me that I wanted it. The following day I hanged out with him and other old high school friends like nothing happened, I guess I became insensitive to whatever people would do to me.
After coming to MIT, I for the first time in my life realized that what has been happening before was not the way things are supposed to be. It was the first time here when I learned what word "consent" meant. I'm not saying that nothing unwanted can happen to you here, but I'm saying that there are many nice people, whom you can trust, and you can have very positive experiences.
