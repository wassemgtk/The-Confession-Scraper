I understand that our class doesn't have much of note going on, but I am upset that TMAYD is included so prominently on our ring.

Though I’m sure it was created with good intention, it seems it has had little impact on mental health other than generating campus fame and news stories surrounding a single student. In my opinion, while it may do a little bit toward raising awareness, it doesn’t tackle the problem it sets out to solve: that we should have an open dialogue about mental health. Instead, it gives everyone a way to believe they’re helping by labeling themselves “open to talk” when they’re really doing nothing to help those who are too afraid to be open about their problems. Do we really believe people with crippling anxiety or suicidal thoughts are going to reach out to us now that we’re wearing a wristband? Perhaps its true intention is to create a culture shift, but I see little evidence of this happening.

Furthermore, the student who founded it is now franchising the operation and spreading it to other schools. Their name is plastered all over the TMAYD website, which includes an application to have them come to your school and talk. You can even purchase gear and donate to TMAYD, but it seems like none of the money is going to real charities or institutions that help those who suffer from mental health. While there is nothing wrong with spreading a worthy cause, it feels much more like an expanding startup than a mental health awareness organization because of the way it is structured.

If anyone has data that suggests the contrary, please comment. It won’t make that part of the ring great—it will still just be furthering the fame of a single student that already happens to be rather popular amongst our class—but I don’t want to be disappointed in our Brass Rat.
