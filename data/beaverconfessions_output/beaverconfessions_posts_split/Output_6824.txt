When I came to MIT, everyone told me it would be terrible. They told me that it would be a cutthroat, competitive environment, that no one here would be supportive. 

I'm happy to say that they were entirely wrong. If the recent events have shown me anything, it's how supportive and caring the MIT community is. The way our community has come together astounds me. I've noticed how everyone has become so much more aware and caring, taking the time to check up on close friends and even those who we've only met once. 

Forgive me for trying to put a positive spin on things, but I can't begin to say how proud I am to be part of the MIT community, and I'm so thankful for the opportunity to be here. Christina and Matthew, I wish you had the chance to see MIT the way I do. All I can hope is that this support continues even when our campus isn't experiencing tough times. Then maybe, just maybe, one more person will feel a part of the family we have here at MIT.
