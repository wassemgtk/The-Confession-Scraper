I went to the registrar's office in Building 5 to order official transcripts as I have in the past.  This time, the sassy lady at the desk glared at me and told me that I could only do it online like I was an idiot.  The slightly nicer fellow in the office informed me that "MIT outsourced official transcripts sending to a 3rd party." 

 First dining, then security, and now MIT grades.  What will MIT outsource next?
