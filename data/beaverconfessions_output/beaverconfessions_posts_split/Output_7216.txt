There's a guy I know from hanging out on his dorm hall a lot.  He calls everyone (even girls) "dude."  Maybe it's just my background/upbringing, but I find this annoying and kind of demeaning.  I'm not the type to call him out on it because it's clearly a habit.  It's just that even when I go out with people during the day (and therefore make an effort to look nice/kind of feminine with flattering clothes, makeup, etc), then go hang out on the hall right after, I still am addressed as "dude" instead of by my name, it hurts.  I know you're a really good person, and I have a lot of respect for you.  I just feel like I don't have your respect when you don't feel the need to call me by my name.  Names exist for a reason.  Use them more often than you do.
