Is it bad that I'm glad MIT decided to not completely listen to FFMIT? Because I really don't like or agree with FFMIT and it seems like no one feels the same around me...
I love the earth and crap but I don't agree with their solution to the problem. I don't really think divesting would do much other than give a university a political stance. Oil is big enough to not give a shit about loosing a couple million.
