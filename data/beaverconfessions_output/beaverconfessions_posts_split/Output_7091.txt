To all the people who wanted to go to MIT to do something good for the world:
You already have that power, right now, as students.
It's easy to be bitter in a place like this, but just showing someone kindness, whether or not they are a friend, makes this place more rewarding.
I feel like once a few years have gone by a lot of us lose sight of that. 
Keep doing nice things, it doesn't take that much time or effort, and we can turn this place around.
