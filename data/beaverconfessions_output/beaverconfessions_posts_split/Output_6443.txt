Why would anyone ever want to drink from a firehose? Seriously, if you're thirsty and a drinking fountain isn't enough, you need a water bottle or like, a gallon of water, and you can take it at your own pace! Or a regular hose! Getting blasted by a firehose sucks and is bad for you, and the big reward at the end is that you can get a job where they regularly blast you with a firehose. I don't get it; doesn't anyone here just want a pleasant life?
