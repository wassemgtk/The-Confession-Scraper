I'm a second semester senior and for the people who are fascinated by the idea of pursuing a double major, I'd say really do your research. Just because it sounds cool or you like the idea of it, doesn't mean it's worth it. People often compare themselves with others and see where they rank...don't do that. If you want to do course 15 or 9 or 6-2 or 18C, follow your passion. Just because it's an ego boost to say you're doing multiple majors, or because you think it's a good challenge is not a good enough reason. I'm barely getting by and I've had to fill out this damn add drop form nearly 8 times in the past week to make sure my schedule works. Pursue a double major, but come in with a plan, be flexible to doing other classes if your initial schedule doesn't work, and do it for the right reasons. Oh and in 5 years, it's not really gonna matter that much.
