I hate you so much that I hope that every time you walk around in socks you step in something wet, when you are in the most comfortable position in bed, you have to pee, your headphones always tangle in your pockets no matter how neatly you wrap them, whatever you are watching stops to buffer just before things get good, you forget what you were about to do when going through a door (and then stub you toe), and that every time you are barefoot you step on a LEGO brick.
