This is a post to take back my last post (which referred to a response to another post about calling her "my girl")

I submitted my last confession premeditated before allowing others to comment on my last post. Now that I have read other people's thoughts on the situation, things have changed. 
The Internet is not a place to judge people's intentions through a post because you cannot assume you know the connotation they have assigned to their words. Passive aggressiveness through text is very subtle, yet powerful. 
Please do not condemn my thoughts on having pride in my girlfriend. And I will not condemn you for your sensitivity. 
Thank you.
