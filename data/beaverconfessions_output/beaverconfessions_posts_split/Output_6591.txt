When I was in highschool all the boys would make fun of me at gym. I dreaded walking into the locker room and being forced to take off my clothes and hear the laughter, the taunts, feel my humiliation rise. I was humiliated by the size of my penis. I remember them saying, "Hey Donkey Slong, whens the new game coming out?", "What's with the third leg?", and asking, "What's with the timber between your legs?". Their taunts towards me for it ran ceaselessly, that and the fact that I was openly homosexual.
