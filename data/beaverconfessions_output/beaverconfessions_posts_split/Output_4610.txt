Tonight, I attempted to use the Wii remote to masturbate during a game of Super Smash. Not only was the vibration power weak, but I kept losing, which made me angry. I did play with Captain Falcon, so if you are into cartoon characters with super erect nipples, that’s an added bonus to this method. Also, it looks like Playstation’s Dual Shock control has a more powerful vibration, so if you’re between Nintendo, X-Box and Playstation, maybe that’s your deciding factor.
