Does anyone else have hyperhydrosis?  It really sucks and I'm always sweating no matter how much antiprespirant or what kind I use (I've even used the clinical stuff through an Rx but had bad reactions to it).  It contributes so much to my anxiety day after day and makes me want to hide up in my room and just not go out.

I'm going to try and save up enough money to get some cosmetic surgery for it this summer.  It's really expensive and insurance doesn't cover it but I just want some piece of mind so I don't feel like disgusting trash when walking around campus. :/ :(
