I dealt with mental health issues related to depression and anxiety last year and for a while I thought I was better.  I stopped taking my medication (under help from my doctor) and in general my anxiety got better, and my depression improved as well.

Little did I know that was simply due to it being close to the end of the year.  Starting up this year, I'm once again faced with the mountains of Psets, essays, and labs that just take a toll on me.  It's so hard to talk to anyone about anything, and honestly I view the whole TMAYD thing as just another fad for people to pretend to care to look popular.  I know it's not everyone but that's definitely the vibe I get.  Holding up a facade towards your friends tires me out just as much as Psets do.

It's hard to talk to anyone, and for the love of god I don't want to go back on my medication.  It helps with the anxiety and depression, but it makes me feel like a zombie.

I wonder how long it will take for the administration to say something about mental health this year.  I don't want to have to hear about another suicide and I think we need to have legitimate, preemptive discussions about mental health.

But that's just me, and I'm a cynic at heart, I suppose.
