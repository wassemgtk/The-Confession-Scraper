I feel like I have this odd sixth sense about when things are about to go wrong. It's actually really creepy. Like the other day, a few people from my lab and I went to a Celtics game with our PI. All of the sudden this feeling struck me and I thought, "This day is not going to end well." Sure enough, later that evening my dad beat the shit out of me with a set of jumper cables.
