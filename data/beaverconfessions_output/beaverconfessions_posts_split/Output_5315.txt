I keep hearing the in the media how we need to have "honest discussions" about race relations between blacks and whites. That is not really going to happen in my opinion. Here's why, nobody can really talk about it without character assassination. If you talk about it and you're white, you get called a racist, if you are black, you get called an Uncle Tom. Everyone is too afraid to have an honest discussion, so lets stop pretending we are going to have one, and just keep the message honest and simple. We do not talk about race differences under any circumstances ever.
