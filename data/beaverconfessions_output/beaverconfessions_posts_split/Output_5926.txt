I saw some graphic recently where it depicts a man touching a woman's hair and being like "oh so soft" and the woman thinking "stop touching me." I think this was meant to show something about gender interactions and men not respecting women's bodies, which I think is a totally valid point. The thing that made it weird for me is I've been in the exact same situation as the woman in the picture except I'm male. 
I also have had the experience of being unwillingly followed around and unwantedly touched and kissed by a girl I had absolutely no interest in and thought I had made this clear. I felt like I couldn't defend myself physically without being blamed and I felt really disrespected. I have pretty much succeeded in blocking this out to the point where I can't really say it has had an adverse effect on my longterm wellbeing.
However, what I'm trying to say is I feel uncomfortable when I see things that seem to indicate stuff like this only happens to women because I feel like it sort of denies my experience to only highlight interactions like this when the man is the oppressor and not the victim. At the same time, I understand that the scenario probably is (much?) more likely to occur with the offending party being male and I don't think it was intending to deny my experience.
So I just felt like getting this off my chest.
That said, to my fellow guys, make sure to respect women, and to the women reading this, make sure to respect us too.
