I just went to a Body Sculpt group exercise class to fulfill my fucking PE requirement one day before my last final here. I skipped my normal exercise routine to do this. Now I have shooting nerve pain in my rotator cuff from mixing strength exercoses with aerobics, and my back feels like jelly. I still have to study to do well enough on this final to graduate and I just can't fucking believe the last-minute debts I have to pay off to this shitty fucking school. Fuck the PE requirement -- it was the second-most detrimental thing to my mental (and physical) health at MIT, beaten only by the lack of weekend walk-in hours at Mental Health.
