i had a best friend who, in every single conversation and sometimes multiple times a conversation would say "dont fall in love with me"
oh, how many times did i ask her to stop (that shit got annoying)
but word of advice, if you want someone to not have feelings for you, it's not a good idea to constantly remind them of the ...likelihood? that theyll fall in love with you. for a while i thought you were just trying to mess with my head (if u were, as u can see, it worked)
