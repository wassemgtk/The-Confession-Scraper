How and why spiderman can be considered one of the greatest superheros of all time is beyond me. Shit, if hes a superhero then I, and every other individual who identies as male should have the status of superhero as well. Whats so great about a seventeen year old boy with the ability to shoot sticky white stuff out his wrist?
