To the kid that mocks me in class every time I say something wrong or get a wrong answer:

Fuck you. Just because you understand something the first time doesn't make you an inherently better human being.I can brush off a few disparaging comments, but enough is enough. 

We are a fucking community. We are here to help each other survive these four years. So instead of being an egotistical dick head, how about you maybe tell me why I'm wrong without being condescending? How about you respect me because I'm human, instead of treating me like I'm less because I don't understand these things as fast as you do.

Get over yourself, because the faster you do, the better it will be for all of us-- including you.
