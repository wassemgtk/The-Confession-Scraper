I got an internship at a top national research laboratory coming out of my shitty high school, but two years in a row, as an MIT student with the help of all the career resources here, I can't even get recruiters to respond to a fucking email. 

At least having 3 summers worth of landscaping on my resume will probably be a huge help when competing with people with fucking google and facebook and apple on their resumes for jobs after graduation, right?
