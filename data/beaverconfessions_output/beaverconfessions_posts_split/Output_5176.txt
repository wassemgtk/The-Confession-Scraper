Here's what I don't get about the assisted suicide debate. Why do you need a doctor to do it? If you honestly want to kill yourself, why don't you just do it yourself. It's so stupidly easy. I think the truth is, people who are adamant on it, really just want social approval, not the actual help of a doctor.
