I have been developing a theory but I'm afraid of the backlash my thoughts might receive, so I have opted to test the waters through MIT Confessions. I am a straight white woman, and these are my opinions.

I believe that gender is binary. I believe people can be trans, but I do not believe in the fluidity of gender. That's not to say you can't claim to be gender fluid, and I can't tell you what to say or how to feel about your gender. But at the same time I cannot be forced to call you 'xer' or 'them.'

Here's the meat of the idea: The issue of transgenderism isn't new, and the concept that gender is a social construct is also not new, both of which I agree with. However there is no inbetween. Due to the nature of biological sex, there are only two 'mental sexes' or genders. Your gender and biological sex can coincide, or not coincide, but there are only two of each (outside of extremely rare cases of hermaphroditism, which is an edge case).

The advent of being genderfluid is, as best I can gather, a result of globalism and the internet age. As teens grew into adults in the days before the internet, they found their place among their friends and in society based on the small group of people with whom they associated. In the age of the internet, teenagers are finding that they aren't so unique afterall, having been exposed to the opinions of people across the world every day via internet blogs and social media. As a result, the fragile ego of the rising adult causes a scramble for identity. Ultimately, the person clings to something to be different. This is equivalent to being goth in the 90s and early 2000's.

Thanks for your thoughtful responses.
