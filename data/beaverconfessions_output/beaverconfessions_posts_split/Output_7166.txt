I know a girl who will be moving to my EC hall next semester, who "has no filter," who seems to think that it's her worst fault.  I don't think she realizes just how much I envy, respect, and love this about her.  It helps her somehow stay positive and smiling and energetic no matter how much shit gets thrown at her and no matter how hosed she gets.  I wish I knew where this strength comes from because fuck knows I need it.
