NOTE:This is just a thought moving through my mind for some days now and is here only for a healthy debate, I don't want to hurt anyone.

So, we are all up against on race, gender,culture and religious differences recently and are just building upon the idea of humanity, but is this possible at all? I mean to say, For solving a problem, the intelligence (or wisdom level) should be more than what was used to create the problem, so if these differences were not really human idealogical conflicts, we really dont have the power solve it, because the difference is in the very nature that created us and it is just expressing itself,
for example the more you move away from reality, the more it appears in unison, just like a person who takes penance, there are only two entities, universe and oneself, but the more you try to comprehend reality, it seems to breakdown from the "universe" to say "galaxies" to planets to countries to people to cultures to people to family to brothers to bodies to organs to cells to nuclei to atoms to electrons to quarks(there are even two of these), See its in the very nature?

So are we heading in the right direction?
PS: I may seem crazy but it was nice thinking through, maybe you too will enjoy exploring this.
