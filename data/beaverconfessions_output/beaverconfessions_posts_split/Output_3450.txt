God, Dylan Blake is such a badass, with those sexy sunglasses and rough leather jackets.  But your rough, spiky, bad-boy exterior just hides your cuddly and warm interior.  I just want to cuddle endlessly.  Of course, it's not just that you're a human armadillo, you're so much more than that.  You are...a truly singular person, and while you now experience this through pain, one day this very same pain will be an asset, because like anything and anyone worthy of their space you are being forged through adversity.
