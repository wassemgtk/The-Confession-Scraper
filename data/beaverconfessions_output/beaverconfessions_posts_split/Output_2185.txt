I can feel the creep of depression and procrastination and hopelessness invade me once again, after it seemed like it had subsided. And after a solid 2 or 3 weeks of no suicidal thoughts, I can feel those slithering back into my brain too.

But fucking hell, I'm not gonna give up because I've tripped over a pothole in the road. I'm gonna get better.
