I can't even imagine what a disaster it will be if Trump becomes president. Just think of all the horrible things he could do!

He could use false intel to send our country to war without Congressional approval. He could kill thousands of innocent civilians, and even some American citizens with drone strikes. He could go back on all of the things he promised during his campaign. He could fund and arm rebel groups in other countries who then later use those funds and arms against us. He could illegally spy on U.S. citizens. He could have an affair with a White House staffer. He could bug the offices of political opponents and people he was suspicious of. He could attempt to covertly overthrow foreign governments. He could force an entire race of people to relocate, essentially resulting in genocide. He could do all of this, and much more, and then lie to each and every one of us about.

And he's never even held office before! Hopefully one of the real politicians running for President wins. Everyone knows real politicians could never do any of these horrible things. Oh wait....
