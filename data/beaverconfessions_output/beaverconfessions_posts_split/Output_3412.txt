People complaining about MIT Medical like "the other day I went to Urgent Care and I had to wait a whole THIRTY minutes. I bet if I went to MGH I would have only waited like ten minutes. WebMD said that my sore throat and sniffles was probably at least one of cancer, AIDS, and ebola, but the MIT doctor said it was just a cold! They didn't even prescribe me any amphetamines or morphine!! QUACKS!!!
