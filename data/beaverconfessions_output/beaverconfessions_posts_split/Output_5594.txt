I'm a UGC volunteer, and it's personally hard for me to speak to you all in the infinite. I believe in the philanthropy, but all the complaints and the determined ignorance of our presence in Lobby 10 is disheartening. If we're in the way, if you don't want to or aren't able to give, if you don't believe in helping out fellow student projects because you think MIT is somehow hoarding more money than your tuition, that's fine. I just wanted to say that at the beginning of my shifts I'm anxious because I know I'm stopping you on your way to class, and I know most of you are going to ignore me, but I think it's worth noting that a "no thanks" is a thousand times more humane than denying us the acknowledgement of being your colleagues.
