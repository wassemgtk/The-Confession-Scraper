Hey guys. Can we stop with the living group hatred? I don't see any reason to hate on other people's living groups. We all go to MIT and we all have different living/social preferences. Cool. Great. Let people do whatever they fucking want. Your living group is not superior to others and it's also not inferior to any others. Living groups, as radical a thought as it may be, can have different cultures. If you don't like a living group, great. You're entitled to your opinion. There's no need for you to be dramatic and anonymously shit on it. Grow the fuck up.
