I have a question for transgender or gender fluid (generally not cis) people.

I am a cis male, and am happy identifying as such. However, I've never felt a strong sense of resonance or identity with my gender; it's just sort of a fact about me, along with my height or eye color. While my gender affects my interactions with the world around me, I do not feel like it in a vacuum changes who I am or how I view myself. Thus, I identify as male out of convenience.

It seems to me that to be transgender or gender fluid, one must have a much stronger sense of gender identity than I do. My question then is where does this gender identity stem from? Do you feel there is some innate, primal difference between the male and female psyche, and you don't identify with that assigned to you? Or does it have more to do with identifying more strongly with the societal image of men vs women? Would the latter still apply if we ever reached a point where we got rid of gender as a societal construct?
