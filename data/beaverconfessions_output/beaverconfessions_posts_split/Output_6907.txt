I don't understand why MIT decided to remove Walter Lewin's videos from OCW. I understand that his actions are not good ones and should be punished, but I don't think it's right to remove the lectures of a great professor from a free website that's supposed to be a database of classes. Lewin's lectures have helped plenty of students around the world learn physics. Why is it that his mistakes have to deprive future students from learning? 

Is there no separation of the professor from the person? I get that MIT may not want to associate with him during these allegations, but I'm still bothered by the removal of a great resource because of the actions of the person. We're burning 'books' and removing an amazing way to learn and experience a subject because the author did a bad thing, and that scares me.
