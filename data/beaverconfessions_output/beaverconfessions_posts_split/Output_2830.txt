To the guy from 5E EC that I called out for being a rapist in lobby 7: you know who you are, and you know who I am. Turn around when you see me, and leave her alone. You ended my relationship, you hurt me, you hurt her, and god knows who else you've done this too. Fuck you. I don't know how many more times I can see you without things getting out of hand.
