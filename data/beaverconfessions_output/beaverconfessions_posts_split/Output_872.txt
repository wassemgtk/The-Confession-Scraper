I am a prefrosh and currently having trouble with my dorm choices despite hours and hours of research on my preferred dorms.
Could anyone tell me more about the CULTURES and overall living environment at Simmons Hall, Next House and Baker House? (and Maseeh Hall too if it has any culture cuz many people say Maseeh has no culture) 
Anyway, here's my current ranking of top 4 dorm choices:
1. Simmons/Next
2.Simmons/Next
3. Baker 
4. Maseeh
TBH, among the four, I haven't visited Next House, but I'm an instrumentalist and I heard it has a good music culture (or just theatre? I'm not interested in theatrical acts) + other good stuff (like best dining hall etc.), so I put Next as one of my top choices.
