I wish my friends would stop telling me to "take a study break" and hang out with them. No. I've already taken the breaks I need. If I didn't need to be studying, I wouldn't be. I'm so sorry that you all can apparently do fine on the finals without looking at the material much, but I can't. Leave me alone.
