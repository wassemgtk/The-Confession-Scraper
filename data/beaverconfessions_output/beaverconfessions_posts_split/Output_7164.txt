I don't want to go to my internship this summer. The other interns are a bunch of assholes. Some of them contacted me, and I was friendly, but if I could not help them exactly the way they wanted me to, they were just rude. I contacted others with simple questions, and they did not reply, but they replied to the messages of other people....
