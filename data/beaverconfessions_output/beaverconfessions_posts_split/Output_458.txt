So a guy from back home who forcefully sexually assaulted me freshman year during break just got married (saw the pictures via old mutual friend's FB).. and I just keep wondering about the girl... does she know? how could she possibly know? has he hurt her? what would she think if she knew? is she ever afraid of him like I am? I'm scared for her..
