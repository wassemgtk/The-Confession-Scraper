To all overwhelmed and depressed people:
You think your life sucks.
You go out.
You wanna jump out of that bridge. 
You stay there a couple of seconds just staring at the water.
But, before you jump, try just throwing away your burden that you have in your mind.
Throw away everything. It's all in your mind. All those things that you have due tomorrow, due next week...all expectations you have from yourself and from other people...all inner thoughts and insecurities... Just fuck it. Fuck it all. Do you really think they matter? They don't.
You have nothing now. Your mind is free. What do you wanna do? I mean, you can still go in the water (it'd be convenient if you have a swimsuit). Wanna go back in your dorm? Oh wait, you're at MIT! How fucking lucky you are! It's a beautiful evening btw. Can you see the stars? Now decide what you want to do and do it. There's nothing to stop you. You are free. It's all good.
