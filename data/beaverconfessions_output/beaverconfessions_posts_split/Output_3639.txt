I'm a proud feminist and support whatever my fellow ladies want to do with their own bodies, but please, other women, stop telling me that I would be would be happier if I didn't wear a bra. I have large breasts, and if I don't wear a bra I get back pain and horrible posture, not to mention that it physically hurts to move around. Yet, I get so many comments from other lovely feminist women telling me that I don't need one, that I should #freethenipple, that no woman ever wants to wear a bra, and I'd be so much happier and liberated if I didn't wear one and didn't give a fuck what others thought. Believe me, what other people think isn't why I wear a bra. It's because I will literally be in pain if I don't wear one, and wearing a properly fitted, right-sized bra has been a life saver for me (shoutout to r/abrathatfits), and I love my bras. So please, before you insist that I, or any other breasted person, should not wear one, think about how feminism actually encourages each woman to do what is best for herself.
