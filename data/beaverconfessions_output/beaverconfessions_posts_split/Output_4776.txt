Anyone else think the term "leftist" is weird? I've never heard the term "rightist". 

Also the whole using political labels as if they're offensive words (on both sides) is kind of weird (though I've mostly seen them used negatively from the conservative side). Like, I wouldn't be offended to be called a democrat or republican if I was either, because that's already how I self identify.
