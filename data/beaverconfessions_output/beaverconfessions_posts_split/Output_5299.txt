I saw this girl with the most magnificent nose piercing that my eyes have ever had the privilege of beholding. It looked like a stud, twinkling like the stars in the sky, but had the badassery of a hoop. I am just an average joe that also has a nose piercing and would like to know where you got it. I was so focused in on the piercing that I lost the chance to take in the features of your face...awkward. I also may have asked random people thinking it was you...they didn't have a nose piercing...more awkward. If you exist hmu.
