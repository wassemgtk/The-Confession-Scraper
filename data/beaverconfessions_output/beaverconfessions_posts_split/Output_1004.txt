You graduated 
Onto better things in life
Miss you already

True friendship I had
But you won't be coming back
You're worth all the pain

Miles apart, we are
Visit me now and again
That, I too will do

From winter to spring
From spring to summer we go
Change is upon us

Summer will begin
To each our own thing we'll do
Enjoy time away

Stories we will tell
Hope you'll be alive and well
Til we meet again.

Apart, we sure are
Forgotten you'll never be
Til we meet again

Always on my mind
Dear friend, my friend, a great friend
I'm one call away
