Sometimes, I think that the only things I can contribute to conversations are random factoids and punny witticisms.

And that scares me.

It makes me feel like I don't actually have a drive or desire. I don't connect with people on a personal level; I just serve to provide a tiny bit of humor or curiosity for no more than a few seconds.

Weird as it is to say, I feel that I don't even have a strong emotional attachment to myself. I'm going to go through life without ever having an idea as to what I want to be, who I want to be with, and how I can make it happen.

I'd like to think I have friends, but my interactions with people are just so linear and shallow that I can't help but wonder if they simply recognize my existence and go about their day.
