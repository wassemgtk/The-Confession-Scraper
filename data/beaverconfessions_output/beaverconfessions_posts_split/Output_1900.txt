Squirrel Man here… looks like some of my confession got cut off. The worst part of all of this is how these squirrels have been affecting my love life. Last year, I finally mustered the courage to ask out this girl I had liked for a long time. We went to a fancy restaurant and had a wonderful time. Afterwards, we went to get ice cream. While we were in line, she started going on and on about how pecans are the best topping and how she never enjoys ice cream when she forgets to ask for pecans. I’m rather open minded, so I asked for pecans on mine as well (I mean, why not). We walked to a nearby park and sat down on a park bench. We began to eat our ice cream and holy shit, she was so right… the pecans were fucking delicious. So I told her how much I liked the pecans. Then she accidentally spilled some ice cream on her shoes. She put her ice cream down between us and leaned down to wipe her shoes with a napkin. While she was leaning down to clean them, out of nowhere, this fat squirrel scurried up between us on the bench. I tried to shoe it away but instead it ate the pecans… By the time she got back up, it had scurried off… She had this look of disgust on her face and all of a sudden it was clear to me that she thought that I had so enjoyed the pecans on my ice cream, that I stole hers. I tried to explain to her that in fact a squirrel, not me, had taken them. Needless to say, we didn’t have second date… This other time, I was at a party and really hitting it off with a girl. I talked to her for probably an hour when I realized that I really needed to pee. I so badly did not want to go to the bathroom and risk not finding her again at the party, so I decided to hold it. Alas, I could hold it no longer and ran off to the bathroom. After I went, I realized that I was getting sort of warm and so, on seeing the back door next to the bathroom, I decided to go outside to get some fresh air. After a minute or so, I decided I was ready — ready to go back in there and ask that girl out. I turned around only to find a squirrel blocking the door. Unlike other squirrels, this one was excessively jittery and poised to charge me down… a potentially rabid squirrel. I was fed up. Jeez, not again… So I spread my arms wide and tried to look as much like an eagle as possible to scare it away. It started moving towards me… accelerating… I lost my shit and ran away. I got two blocks away from the party. I was about to go back to the party when I realized I was only one block away from my room. Meh.

I used to attract girls, now all I get are squirrels.
