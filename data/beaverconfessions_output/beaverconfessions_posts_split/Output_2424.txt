Why are tourists allowed in libraries? I understand MIT's policy of being "open" to the world, but don't we deserve some level of peace and quiet from tourists' loud camera shutter sounds, children yelling, etc? I've even talked to Barker staff about this and nothing's ever been done. The Barker reading room in particular needs to have some level of privacy for students, during the day there is literally a non-stop flow of tourists in and out of that place. We deserve at least ONE nice, quiet place to study on campus.
