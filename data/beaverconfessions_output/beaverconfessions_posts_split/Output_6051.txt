The worst part about having affirmative action is that sometimes I doubt whether I'm fit to be here.  Am I here just because I'm a minority, or do I actually deserve to be here.

My friends from high school say that I got in because of my ethnicity, and sometimes I wonder whether or not they're right, especially when my impostor syndrome starts acting up.
