I'm freeeeee! I just got out of a long-term, ridiculously emotionally unhealthy relationship and the world just looks so much brighter. Of course I feel like an idiot for letting someone else make me feel completely worthless and depressed for well over a year, but it's over and I'm already so much happier :DDDD
