I am a sophomore at MIT now. People told me all last year it takes about a year to integrate and get friends and all that, but it's been a year and a half for me and I'm still friendless. I see everyone else walking in to class in groups laughing and talking while I just sit there alone like the loner I am. I just don't know how to make friends, and I honestly need some. I don't think I can continue on like this much longer
