I would do anything (within reason) for my friends or even just a fellow classmate. Got a p-set due tomorrow and you are starting it now at 11pm because you were sick all week? I got you. Feeling too sick to leave your room? I'll be there in 30 minutes with a green box with your favorite meal. Having an emotional breakdown because it's all just too much? I'll drop everything in that moment to comfort you, get you a glass of water, talk, or whatever you need. Forgot your ID and got locked out of a building? I'll be right there in 10. But when I'm the one that's sick and starting a p-set late the night before it's due, when I feel too sick to get out of bed, when I'm having a emotional breakdown because it's all too much, when I forget my ID and get locked out of a building, everyone disappears.
