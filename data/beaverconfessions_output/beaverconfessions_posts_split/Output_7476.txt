Dear MIT Confessions Community,

I really like one of my guy friends. He lives in another dorm, so I don't see him very often. I love spending time with him and try to get him to come visit me or spend more time with me. But he's not overly responsive. He likes spending time with me too, but he never texts first, etc. nor asks me to hang out with him. I can guess that he doesn't feel the same about me, but I still want to ask him out. Any thoughts or advice?
