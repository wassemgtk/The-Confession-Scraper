Dear people currently taking 7.013 it is a common courtesy in a lecture hall to shut the fuck up when the teacher is talking.  Whining to the person next to you about your first world problems and then asking what was that the professor wrote on the board is NOT OKAY!!! If you want to talk GTFO and talk outside.
