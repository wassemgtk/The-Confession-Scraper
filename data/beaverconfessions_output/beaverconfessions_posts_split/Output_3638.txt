When I first got to MIT, I didn't concern myself too much with grades. I thought, "In my major, companies won't care much about my GPA since I'm in the top program in the country, ahem, world." I wasn't planning to apply to graduate school right away, and I preferred to spend more time fostering the important relationships in my life and pursuing my extracurricular interests. My parents disagreed and it has been point of contention. A few years later I started applying to summer internships and many of them had a 3.0/4.0 minimum GPA requirement. I only had a 2.8/4.0. I thought, "Shit, my parents were right, I should've tried harder. It's going to be more difficult to find a job than I thought." I applied to six, got interviews at my top two choices, and received an offer from one of them. I'm really excited :D I guess I shouldn't have tried harder after all?
