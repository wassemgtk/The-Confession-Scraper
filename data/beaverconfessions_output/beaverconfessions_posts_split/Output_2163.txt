Ever since I came to MIT I feel like I'm the dumbest person here. I used to call myself a genius.
But MIT has made me so unmotivated and unconfident that I feel like I'm wasting my time and the talents that I wanted to develop here. I can't pay attention in class. I can't do any psets. I don't know what to do.
