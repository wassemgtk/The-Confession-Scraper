I'm a senior now and I had always planned to do an MEng. But I'm not really enjoying my research or my grad classes, so I don't think I want to do an MEng anymore. But I'm kind of forced to do an MEng because I only applied for internships instead of full time jobs and I don't even have any internship offers yet.
