You know, I really love going to MIT. It was my dream to come here since I was 9 years old. Yes, it's hard. And it often kicks me in ass, but I frankly wouldn't have gone anywhere else and I definitely don't regret coming here. I know other people here hate it and/or are having a really hard time here and those people certainly have a right to that opinion. But people constantly tell me something along the lines of "Oh, you like MIT? That's because you're a freshman, you'll hate it eventually." or "Everyone hates this place." or "No one actually cares about other people here.". Sometimes, it's nastier than that. Look, I understand that you may not like MIT and that as I get older it will get harder, but just stop bitching about it for the sole purpose of making me feel as bad about going here as you do. It's not funny, or cool, or whatever. It's downright obnoxious. You may be doing it to let out some anger, but its not fair it's not fair to try to convince someone that if their not miserable, they're doing it wrong. You have the right to feel how you feel, but so do I. I spent my whole life hating going to school especially because of bullying and race issues in my town. I literally would not get out of bed for school some days. College is literally my last chance to have a good experience in school. Give me a chance to decide for myself if I really like this place. But for now IHTFP (I have truly found paradise). *Rant over*
