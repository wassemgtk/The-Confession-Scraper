I honestly wish I had the courage to just tell you I like you, because then you could say you don't like me, and then I could leave you alone for the foreseeable future. 

Or you could go out with that one girl you're always sitting with. (I don't have the guts to go sit with you like she does -- I wish I did. You guys look so happy together, it's really cute.) That’d actually help me a lot. I mean it wouldn’t make me feel better, but it would confirm all my negative feelings? Something certain would be nice at this point.
