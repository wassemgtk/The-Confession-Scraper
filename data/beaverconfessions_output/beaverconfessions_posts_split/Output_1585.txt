There's this guy that I've had a couple classes with over the past couple of years, and every time I saw him he would have the gloomiest look on his face. Even when I would joke around with him, I could never get him to give even a hint of a smile. Today I just saw him walking down infinite with the biggest smile on his face. I don't know why he was smiling so much, but for some reason that gave me so much hope. If he can find reason to be happy during this time, then maybe I can too. Just thought I'd share.
