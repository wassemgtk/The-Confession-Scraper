I confessed my feelings to my best guy friend, and he told me that he felt the same way. The only problem is that we both just graduated and will not be in the same country. I will be working in China for a few years, and he will be studying in Korea. Realistically speaking, we know that a relationship would never work out and that we'll probably never be together. There is a good chance we'll eventually grow apart due to the geographical distance. It just hurts knowing that I never clicked with someone as much as I do with him. I know that there are "plenty of fish in the sea," but I'll probably end up comparing every guy I date in the future to him.
