The OP of #7356 is an idiot and was just baiting people. The overwhelming  majority of Muslim/Arab people aren't that stupid or hateful.

What I wonder though, and this is unrelated, is why is criticism of Israel so often flagged as anti-Semitism? 

I know that like any group of people, the Jewish and Israeli people cannot be generalized and stereotyped, and that like the rest of us, they're just humans trying to do well in life. (As are Arabs, Palestinians, Muslims, and literally everyone...) I don't have a problem with the people.

The policies and actions of the Israeli government however, I do have a problem with.

How can someone express their opposition to the actions of Israel's *government* without being called anti-Semitic? Are there certain words they need to use or ones they need to avoid?

I don't buy the argument out there that criticism of Israel is inherently anti-Semitic. Labeling political scrutiny as religious discrimination is a cheap way of silencing opposition.
