No matter how hard I try I just can't seem to do anything right.  All my grades suck, but I'm constantly working and studying and I never feel like I have a life.  How come my roommate can drink and party all the time and rarely do work and do better than me?  What have I done wrong?  This school makes me hate myself more than I already do.
