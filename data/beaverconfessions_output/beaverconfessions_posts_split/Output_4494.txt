Dear “Doctors” at MIT Medical AKA judgmental fucktards,

You’re supposed to be doctors. You’re supposed to help your patients. You’re supposed to treat your patients to the best of your ability without judging them whether they come to you for mental health or physical health reasons. Just because you are a college medical center does not mean that you should just give us shitty service. We already have more than enough shit to deal with as college students and as MIT students specifically, the last fucking thing we need is for you, our medical care staff, to do a subpar job, especially if we are forced to be stuck with you for the next few years. We have plenty of professors and TAs for that. 

I have heard horror stories about how you treat students that come to you for mental health and how you’ve let really sick students wait in a waiting room for 2+ hours. How can you people call yourself doctors when a student comes in with a 103 degree fever and you send them home saying they have strep throat? A 5 year old could have made a better diagnosis than that!

From my personal experience, I know you people suck. I came in for a normal checkup and yes I knew that I am genetically predisposed to hypertension and high cholesterol and obesity, and that I’m a little overweight, but my family doctor at home in South Carolina never made me feel guilty about my weight. And this is South Carolina, the land of tobacco and BBQ! You sent me to a dietician that only made me feel worse about myself. It was fine at first, she gave me some good advice at first. But then when I talked to her about my Anxiety disorder and my binge eating, she instead of actually giving me advice told me that “You just sound like you want to eat.” And when I gained like 2 pounds from my period, she told me “You’re not trying”.  What the fuck? You’re supposed to give me actual medical advice! Not shame me for an eating disorder! I love food. I like to eat. Just telling me to cut my portions in half and eat things I hate doesn’t fucking work! I don’t need to feel like I’m starving here! Is it my fault that I was never taught how to feed myself healthy food and that we get shitty dining options from Maseeh? That’s what I came to you for! Is it my fault that the “healthy” weight for my height and age is not necessarily a healthy weight for my body type? I’m never going to weigh 110 pounds! Don’t fucking judge me for it!

I know that there has to be some good doctors at Medical, maybe I’m just bitter. But I think that maybe, just maybe, the doctors that are still there need to work on being more accommodating and sensitive to student needs. MIT Medical should not have such a terrible reputation of being the worst medical care you may ever receive in your life. MIT is more than hard enough, getting decent medical care should not have to be another thing added to my very very long list of things to be stressed about. But then again, I might just be bitter.

Sincerely,
A very bitter sophomore
