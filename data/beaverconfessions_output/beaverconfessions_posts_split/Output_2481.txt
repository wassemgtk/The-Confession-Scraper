I find it awesome that so many people care about so many social issues. But I also find it sad that no one will ever be sensitive about the things that have affected me the most. People have no qualms about calling themselves or others retarded, or looking at someone and saying "You're adopted." A high school teacher once went so far as to ask who would be stupid enough to die in the manner my parents died, having no knowledge of the situation. I was the only one who even noticed this, of course, because people just don't care about things that don't affect themselves. So many people make so many judgments about other people, without taking a moment to realize that there are real people affected by what you say and how you treat people. And yeah, I get that my personal issues aren't really up there on the level of importance as Black Lives Matter and the LGBTQ movement, but you know what? If people took 2 seconds to think about what they say before they said it, it would make a hell of a difference.
