Here I am sitting alone in the park. A child with no say, no passion for anything but living. Hoping that my Prince Charming will swoop in and save me from a boring life with hardly a care in the world. Oh, it would be romantic no doubt. But a tale that only caters to the rich, those of us who can afford to look nice and take time from our not so busy days to sit enjoying the sun in th Boston Public Gardens. How did I become so callous? That of all the problems and poverty in the world, the only thing I date dream of fixing is my boredom. But still I sit. The girl who thinks too much but never enough.
