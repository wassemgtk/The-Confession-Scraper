My mental health just keeps fluctuating... Functioning for a week, stop working for a week... Never long enough to keep up with school, but also not long enough to flunk out.

basically I have shitty grades in a pretty useless major (not science/engineering/math).
future doesn't look that bright.

at least I know I have well-off family.
