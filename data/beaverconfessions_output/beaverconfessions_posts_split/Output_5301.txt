We are the under-rested--
the overstressed
Backs hunched, fingers rattling keys--
pushing.

We are the "prove myself"s--
the "am I good enough"s
who by some small stroke of luck are bound
by an institution.

Bound by late nights,
by too much caffine,
by self-doubt,
and by relief.

We fought to get here--
We fought to stay here--
We fought to leave here--

We will fight because we have been here.

For today,
For tomorrow--
