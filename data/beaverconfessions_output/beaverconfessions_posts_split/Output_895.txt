This has been such an intense semester… Struggling through final projects and psets last week… my girlfriend broke up with me over email during the weekend and there are still finals to come. Honestly, I feel so shitty right now, so uncertain about years to come and yet…

I was walking across the bridge just now. And I saw this view: two long ugly cranes piercing the sky and … the dome - shining with lights just like in a postcard. This was such an amazing moment. The moment of realization that I’m here at MIT. The place I couldn’t have imagined to be at a few years back. And yet I’m here.

Yes, it feels shitty. But my life is so rich here. I’ve learned a lot, made such wonderful friends, got to know a beautiful person (fuck the email, though; who does that?). I am pushing my skills to their boundaries and have matured a lot. I am no masochist, but I know that even though it is a tough time right now, I will cherish it in the future. Life is beautiful in many ways.

We can make it, guys. Just one more week. Good luck everyone! Everything will be great :)
