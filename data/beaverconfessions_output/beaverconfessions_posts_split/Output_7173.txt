To the priveleged: remember that people have the right to speak out about their struggles. To the non-priveleged: remember that even priveleged people have struggles, albeit lesser ones, and see my previous point. Also, I really wish I didn't have to dichotomize into priveleged and non-priveleged, because it's not us and them. It's all of us together, especially at a place like MIT.
