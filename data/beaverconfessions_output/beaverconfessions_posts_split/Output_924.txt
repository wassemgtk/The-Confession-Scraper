So, the other day T.I., Dr. Dre and Marsha Ambrosius dropped the song called Dope. The song itself is so smooth, so you should definitely check it out, but in the music video Travis Scott makes a cameo with an MIT sweatshirt!!!!! Shit is beyond lit, MF Travis Scott with an MIT sweatshirt bruh... Check it out here (he makes cameos at around 1:49, 2:29 and 2:50)...:
