Begins rant:

As a black non-American male who can actually dance, [as confirmed by my awards from dancing competitions] lets say I am actually frustrated by the type of girls I meet on the dance floor at MIT and around the Boston area. (Am 21+) . In my experience, I have met two types of girls.

1) The white, asian [including Indians of course], or black girl who is insecure or probably lacks exposure and refuses to dance with any black male. I make this conclusion because I see them dancing with another  non-black male immediately after they turn down dancing with me. And repeat this disgusting behaviour throughout the party. I actually try to watch to see if I can prove myself wrong. Unfortunately, they prove me right every fucking time.

2)  The ones who understand that a party is just a party and are willing to dance with anyone who can prove that they got moves.

Now, if you belong to group two, clap for yourself. Those who belong to group one however, should check themselves or their prejudices. Do you prefer dancing with non-black males to black males? Why?...
Do you understand that this behaviour could have a racist undertone? If you act this way because of what the media perpetuates, check yourself. Relax and have fun. Parties are supposed to be fun and not a space to bring whatever racist tendencies you have. 

This post about discrimination also rings true for black women and online dating as well... but I won't delve into that for sake of brevity.

I feel like this part of the world is overly obsessed with unfounded assumptions about races to the point where communities at schools like MIT and other schools around the Boston area are so segmented. Lets chill and have fun people, We share more in common than our differences to be honest...
