To the guy who left a puddle on TOP of the urinal in building 66... seriously dude? Let's say the urinal is 2 feet high and your starting height is around a foot up. In order to reach the top of the summit, you'd have to either be firing your cannon at 60+ degrees or shooting out at a painful 2+ m/s (you can plan your trajectory next time here: http://www.mrmont.com/teachers/physicsteachershelper-proj.html). Thanks.
