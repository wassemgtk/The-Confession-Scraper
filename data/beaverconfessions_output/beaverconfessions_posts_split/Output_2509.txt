Was in Baker D and overhead a group of black women talking about Trevor McMichael's post, and how insensitive and offensive he what he said in the caption. About 5 minutes later after getting my food, I hear them from across the dining hall calling each other retarded and laughing hysterically.

This stood out as amazingly ironic to me, and I now realize I've seen it in many other instances than this.

I understand that people would find his post offensive, especially if it spoke about something you could relate to. But seriously, you're going to act like everything you say is PC and that you are so careful about every word you speak? Sure, his post was on facebook (public) which opens him up to much more criticism, but don't pretend that you've never said anything analogously offensive, or that if you did that you always self-reflected and caught yourself. 

There is so much judgement, ignorance, and hate in this world and I understand that you want to rid our community of all of it. But who do you think you are to be excused from your own social contract when someone else breaks it? Especially when you don't always hold yourself to it either. Hate doesn't justify hate. 

How about we think a little bit more about all the things that WE DO to those we impact, and a little less about what we think society is doing to us. How about we use these instances of lack of knowledge to EDUCATE, rather than take out all the anger, the anger that has bottled up from the injustices in our lives, on one another.

So many people are so quick to be skeptical of Trevor's intentions and sincerity in apology. First of all, think of something you've said or done that could be insensitive towards a group or persons and imagine having probably 100s of people talking to you about it and shaming you for it. Think about how you would respond. Think about how that would feel. Think about how difficult it is to say the perfect apology when it's so easy for anyone to say "well that's just not good enough". Why do you want to inflict these feelings on to someone so badly?

Let's have a bit more empathy. A bit more understanding. Give what you want to receive. More talking, less accusing. More learning, less labeling. For fucks sake, stop letting every word that is said affect your emotional well-being; life is hard enough already. It should be addressed, but why emotionally attach to a principle that can only bring you down, especially when the whole motive is to get rid of that principle? You can make change from a more unattached and empathetic role.

Anyway, I love you all. I felt like this is something that should be said a little bit more, and even if people disagree I think that this is the direction we all truly want to go in in our conversations (love, empathy, and understanding that is).
