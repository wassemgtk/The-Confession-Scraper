I'm not apologizing for things I shouldn't apologize for and I'm not thanking you for hurting me and "teaching me a lesson on who to trust." You don't get to be the person that makes me feel like I did anything wrong, and you don't get to  be the person that "opened my eyes." You have no power over me and in short, well..fuck you.
