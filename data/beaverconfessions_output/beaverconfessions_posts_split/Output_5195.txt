When lacking motivation to start a pset, clearly what's needed is incentives. Orgasms. I'll give myself one if I do half of it. Or a quarter. Or just this subproblem, which is obviously the meat of this entire pset anyway since it is taking me so long. Wait, actually, I'm horny *now*. Whoops.

It's gotten worse since freshman year, since now I've been to trained to think of nighttime as work-time. It's midnight and the essay is due at 10am? Great, I have 10 whole hours. I can do anything in 10 hours. I can drive to Chicago in 10 hours. I can probably do a whole semester-long project in 10 hours.

Whoops.

Sometimes it feels like the problem is procrastination, and sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes I want to beat myself up for dicking around, partying, binge-watching whatever it is, throwing away entire weekends. But sometimes it feels like I'm doing the maximum amount of work per week possible while still staying sane.

Precious, precious time.

Last time I asked, this time I have to implore. Last time I begged, this time I have to grovel. Please please please I need an extension. Take pity on me! Observe: genuine, salty tears! Taste them!

I have no sympathy for myself.

I should have started earlier. Every damn time. You were doing something else yesterday? You should have started that earlier, too. And so on. You have four tests this week? And when did you become aware of this? That's right.

The only valid excuse I can think of for assignments given WEEKS ahead of time is if somehow all the material required wasn't taught until a couple of days before the assignment is due. But that really doesn't happen very often.

I used to wish the stakes were higher, quicker. Immediate pain. No, I am not an adult with more than 24 hours' foresight. For fuck's sake, schedule my day for me. Give me zero-tolerance late policies. Mandatory mini-checkpoints for long-term projects. Someone to whip me if I don't go to bed on time.

But I'm not even sure it would work anymore. If my life depended on an assignment due next Friday at 10 a.m., and I know beforehand that I will be forced Thursday night to go to bed at 10 p.m., then, well, it would probably be the end of me.

Can anyone spare a little willpower? We'll just hook our brains up with a plastic tube. I have cash.
