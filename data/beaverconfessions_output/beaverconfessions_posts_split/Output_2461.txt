If this MIT Confessions page has impacted your life in a real way, good or bad, and you're willing to share, I want to hear from you: mitconfessionstim@gmail.com
Anonymity can be granted. I'm doing this for a story because I think MIT Confessions has become a significant yet under-analyzed force on our campus. Both good and bad have come out of it, and we should acknowledge that.
