As far as I can tell, there are two common types of people who use dildo.io. Let individual examples of each be Alice and Bob. Alice has 50 people checkmarked on her dildo.io account, all of whom she'd be legitimately happy to fuck, though there are some people she is more interested in than others. She's happy to match even with people who have checkmarked literally everyone else in the interface. Meanwhile, Bob has maybe 1-3 people selected (and maybe Bob wouldn't even want to fuck all of them, but would be interested in some sort of hookup, or in dating, or whatever). Bob has his settings such that he won't be matched with someone interested in more than 10 other people, because it would be super awkward to be matched with someone when they're one of a few for him, but he's one of many for them.

So here, even if Alice and Bob would both love to hook up with one another, they don't get matched. I don't think either Alice or Bob are necessarily doing anything wrong, but the Alices and Bobs of dildo.io should just be aware that this is a common way for them to not get matches, and that no match != no interest.
