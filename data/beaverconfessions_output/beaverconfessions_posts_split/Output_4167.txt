@4249 Calm yourself. Let's discuss this. First: By triggering, I mean literally triggering-- I have PTSD, as diagnosed by two separate psychiatrists. I'm on heavy antipsychotics to stop the flashbacks and to manage the severe depression. It's possible for other people to have PTSD too, and I don't want to risk someone having an episode in public. That would be beyond mean.
If you need help, please get help. I'm dealing with my stuff in the way it works for me. You deal in the way that works for you. At the end of the day, we both went through shit that sucked and we're both just trying to survive. (I'm not trying to blab my personal business to the world-- I was discussing the regimen of drugs I was taking to prevent HIV. Not giving him a blow by blow of the last time I was raped.)
I'm sorry this happened to you. It's something no one should have to go through. But please remember that we're in this together. Why attack each other when we can support each other through this horrific experience? Attacking each other will only ever make the real problem-- the rape culture pervading our society-- worse. 
I hope that you find closure somehow, whether or not it's through talking to every person on the street, or never talking to anyone. And remember, no matter what, you're stronger than you know :)
