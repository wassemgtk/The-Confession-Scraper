ive been trying, for the past 2 months now, to figure out why so many of the people whom I considered my closest friends here (and who also live with me, for that matter) suddenly topped talking to me. it feels like they hate me and I know I must have done something to cause it, but I haven't been able to figure out what. All my guesses end up being wrong. I don't want to move. My therapist says the direct approach probably isnt the best idea. I don't know what to do.
