While clearing out my wardrobe and packing up my clothes I discovered that 90% of my t-shirts are from free events and career fairs. There's nothing inherently wrong with this (they're very comfortable, after all) but I suddenly realized post-graduation I no longer have any desire to walk around in public wearing the logos of companies I'm unaffiliated with and feel zero affinity to...

Guess I have to start buying real people clothes now? But more than that, I wish I hadn't been so froshily excited to collect so many useless company t-shirts that I only ended up wearing once or twice only to donate all of them away... it's such a huge waste.
