Maybe I am in the minority:I thought the Fossil Free MIT blue ribbon tape was a pretty neat and effective way to broadcast their message. It certainly caught my attention. It was big and bold and impossible to avoid. I thought it was wasteful at first. Sure, they could have done something else, but any complaining about the blue ribbon tape is, I feel, quite unjustified. The only reason I see people complaining is because they are an environmental group; I am sad to see that the same people are not complaining about the yellow ribbon MIT Facilities puts up on Kresge nearly every week, in an absolutely futile attempt to keep the grass green. It is akin to criticizing them for putting up copious amounts of paper to broadcast their events, just like every single other student group on campus. Are we to restrict this group, that is fighting to combat global climate change, to solely forms of communication that in no way affect the environment? If you have to use a few trees, or use a few gallons of gas, in order to save billions of trees and human life as we know it, by all means, you have my blessing.

Thank you, Fossil Free MIT. I am not a member, but your display brought a great issue to light. Everyone is talking about it, and even if they are discussing it negatively, at least they are talking about it. Plus, you got a response from President Reif! Go you! Please continue to encourage people to divest from fossil fuels, and make the world a better place. And if you have to use a few yards of blue ribbon tape once every year, by all means, do so: I think the cause you are fighting for is a little bit bigger than a roll of blue ribbon tape.

Peace.
