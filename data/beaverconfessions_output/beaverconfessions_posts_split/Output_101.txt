@8339 Yes, international students are expected to have much higher achievement than U.S. students in order to be admitted (3% international, vs 8% U.S.), so they are smarter (as in the common-sense meaning of "smart", sorry for not being PC here). In fact, most of them have IMO/IPhO/IOI/etc. medals, which are some of the top achievements that are widely accessible by students. In addition, STEM education in U.S. is crap compared to countries that contribute to a major percentage of international student admissions.
