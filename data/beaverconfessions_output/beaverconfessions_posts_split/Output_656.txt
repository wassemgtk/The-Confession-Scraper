To be honest, I really hate Kevin Kraft. Last summer, he insisted on meeting for a disciplinary item, and when I told him I was on the west coast and couldn't actually meet in person, he got mad and in a phone call accused me of trying to evade punishment and being uncompromising. I even took time out of my work day to phone call him!

I've been terrified of speaking about this to people but now that I'm graduating, this is one thing I definitely won't miss. It's so ironic that someone who harasses students is the face of the CoD. MIT should be ashamed for this.
