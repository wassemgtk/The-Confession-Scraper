I got invited to an event called "The Great American Smokeout". I naturally assumed this was an event celebrating smoking. So I showed up with my joints, cigs, and a cigar for good measure. Then I found out the event was actually hosted by the American cancer society and it was an anti smoking event. Boy did I get some dirty looks there.
