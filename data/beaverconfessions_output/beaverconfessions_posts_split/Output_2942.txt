You 2019's can complain all you want about your class council, but they've got nothing on the 2016's. For such a large class, the amount of tickets they get for signature MIT class events is alarmingly low. Boos Cruise was a mess. Senior Ball? We have a huge wait list. Hell, even our Senior Toast during senior week looks like it's gonna have a ticket cap. These are huge events that everyone should be able to go to and make memories of our class together. MIT students talk a lot about "people first" and "supporting your peers", but where is all of that in practice, if the most fundamental events are already exclusive?
