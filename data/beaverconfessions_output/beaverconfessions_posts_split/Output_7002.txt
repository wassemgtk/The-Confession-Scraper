I got externship offers and asked my dad for advice on which I should pick. He wasn't impressed because none of the companies are "big" and he thinks I probably wouldn't learn that much. Sometimes I get sick of this. Why the freak is this still happening? I thought I left 'not good enough' behind in freshman year but it's still following me around and it pisses me off.
