People who support Trump and claim MIT people aren't being "open minded" about it: I can only speak for myself here, but dude... I have never been close-minded toward my Trump supporter aquaintances. That'd involve shutting them out and not giving them a chance to explain where they're coming from. But, indeed most would do the opposite--we'd ask you questions and try to understand you and do a whole darn analysis of your background versus that of the Nazis--to try and understand your view. 

TLDR: !!!We're not being close-minded by searching for an explanation/good argument. You're being close-minded by realizing you don't have one and not changing.!!!
