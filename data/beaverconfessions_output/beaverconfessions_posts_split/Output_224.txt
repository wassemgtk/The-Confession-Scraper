How can I make new friends?
I try my hardest, but I just can’t…
I had an group of friends, and I was happy in MIT.
But this semester they pushed me out of the loop.
They don’t talk to me anymore.
I can’t blame them.
I’m not a very social person.
I have autism.
Making friends has been a challenge my whole life.
I thought my friends in MIT were the kind of people who would understand my struggles.
But they didn’t.
I see them together all the time.
They look happy.
I’m glad they are happy.
But I want to run to my room and cry when I see them.
They used to be my friends, and now they are not, and I don’t know why.
I want to move on, make new friends, but I can’t.
Everybody here was a group of friends already.
Nobody would want me in their group.
I’m shy, I don’t talk much, I’m weird.
But I want friends.
