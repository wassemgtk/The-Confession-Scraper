I really hate it when non-MIT people post on here. I already feel like an animal in a zoo. Everyone's watching you. Staring at you. You're a tourist attraction. They're there. Watching you walk. "Wow MIT students have legs too." Watching you work. "Wow MIT students get stuck too." Watching you in bed. "Why is that MIT student having sex? They should have been solving the world's problems in that time." I'm listening to non-classical music and I'm on my phone and they know. They're watching you now. Look around the room and ask, where are they now? What corner have they taken over to watch your every move. Is it human nature? To take whatever's different and turn it into an attraction? Well reader, are you the watcher or the watched?
