Growing up in a financially unstable household, lacking friends, under the care of an unbalanced parent is the worst. I've always felt different from other people and it's only ever been a giant pain in the ass. Believing the oft said adage about difficult experiences building stronger character is much more palatable than realizing that the opposite is true for the majority of those affected. I'm tired of thinking the way I do, and would swap out my psyche for that of a unburdened, spoonfed ignoramus in an instant. They sure get further in life and forge nicer friendships. Feelings are tiring as hell, fucking christ.
