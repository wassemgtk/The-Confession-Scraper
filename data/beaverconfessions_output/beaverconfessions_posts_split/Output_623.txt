I want to install my tech at MIT. But I still don't know how to do that. Friends told me that I should ask seniors. 
FYI the tech is capable of locating a powered off stolen device and doesn't use the device's battery power. It works effectively on every device from a GoPro to a Laptop (or MacBook). 
Help a brother here.
