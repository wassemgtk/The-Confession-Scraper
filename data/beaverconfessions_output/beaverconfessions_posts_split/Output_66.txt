Dear MIT Housing,

If you're going to be dicks and catch people who don't leave during one of the way-too-many fire alarms because apparently you haven't fucked over the students enough, at least do it on a weekend when I don't have actual shit to do. Then again, this note assumes you care at all about student welfare, so I guess this note is useless.

Signed,
All of MIT
