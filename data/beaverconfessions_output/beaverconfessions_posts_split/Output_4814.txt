@ #3610. It's not all one person. I know because I do some, but I'm really curious who does the rest. Having pride in my race really does make me the scum of the earth, but you keep working to perpetuate your victimhood, and I'll keep working to perpetuate the idea what white pride is beautiful. And whoever is with me on this, whoever you are, I love you from afar.
