you are stronger than you realize. your strength is not your ability to hit balls out of the park. it's not how many KO's you get in the ring. it's not your pset score. it's not the number of friends you have. it's not your charisma, it's not whether or not you have a UROP, it's not whether you're working on a super cool project, it's NONE OF THAT.

your strength is your ability to get up after life knocks you down. it's about being hopelessly shattered and broken, but picking up the pieces anyway. and i don't know you, but i bet you've done this many, many more times than you deserve.

and it's hard. i know it's hard. you struggle to get out of bed, get dressed, and go to class. you might not be able to some days, but fuck if you aren't going to try. you hate yourself, you're tired, you just want it all to end, but you still work and work and push and push, even when all you feel is dead inside.

but you aren't. you. aren't. you're alive and kicking, you're clawing at any straws you'll get to survive, just to get to the next day. the blizzard has been beating on you mercilessly for days, weeks, months, years on end, but you're still keeping that ember alive. please don't ever give up. i know you're stronger than that.
