It's finally come to that point. I've eaten my fill indiscriminately for two years here, and now I'm pretty sure I'm 13 pounds over what is considered a healthy weight for a person of my age and height.

I'd like to say this weighs heavily on my mind, but that would be a lie created for a silly joke. Instead, I'll simply try to partake in less cake and work my way from there.
