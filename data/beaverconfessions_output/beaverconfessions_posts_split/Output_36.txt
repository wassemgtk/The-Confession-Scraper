Is there any scenario where voting for Trump would genuinely be an overall better choice than voting for Hillary? If someone held a gun to a person's head and said they had to choose one of the two to vote, would Donald ever be better to choose? I'd never vote for Trump, gun or no, but I'd like to know what others think.
