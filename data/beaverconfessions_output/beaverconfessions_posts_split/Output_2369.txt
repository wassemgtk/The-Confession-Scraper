I'm in love with my best friend, and I have no idea what to do about it. We're graduating seniors, and we won't even be in the same country after graduation. Part of me wants to pour my heart out to him at graduation, but part of me is scared that he won't feel the same way and I won't hear from him again because it'll be too awkward.
