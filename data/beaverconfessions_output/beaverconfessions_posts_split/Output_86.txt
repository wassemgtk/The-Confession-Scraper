Trying to keep it together as a senior. It's still hard, but I think I'm finally getting the hang of it. I still need a few pills to keep me going, but I'm still going, and intend to keep going. 

I like looking back on how much my friends and I have changed in our time here. We still don't have all our shit together, the future is still a bit scary, but more and more people are starting to figure out what they want, who they are. It's nice. Hang in there, it get's better, I promise.
