4162 People like you are the reason I barely ever talk about my rape or difficult experiences, even with close friends who could help. I agree with your boyfriend, it's private, stop using it to get sympathy from people. Stop being so attention seeking, makes me suspect people are lying when they talk so much and to a bunch of people they don't even know that well about something private and difficult. Also, "triggering"? Shut up. I hate this "pat yourself on the back because everything you do is right and you're a beautiful special snowflake no matter what". You disgust me.
