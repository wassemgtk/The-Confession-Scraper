I tried to talk to S^3 because I feel like it's impossible for me to finish everything that I have to do. They basically told me that it's my own fault and all I can do is talk to my professor and hope for the best. 
 

I wish I could communicate to them how panicked I am and how strong the desire to hurt myself is without getting worrying about getting forced out of MIT.
