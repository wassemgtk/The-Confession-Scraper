Has anyone actually gone up to a stranger wearing a TMAYD wristband and told them about their day? Just curious. There's a good intention and it's getting a lot of publicity but I haven't heard of anyone it's actually helped, other than the people who get to feel good about themselves for wearing wristbands...
