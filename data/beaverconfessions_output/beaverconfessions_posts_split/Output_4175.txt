In the dating scene I've noticed an issue with men here not accepting every womans identity. For example, I physically am about 200 pounds, but I do not identify as a fat person, I identify as an athletic runner who burns around 4000 calories a day and thus at dinner can do things like order extra nachos for myself because I need the energy. Unfortunately here many men do not yet seem ready to accept what I identify as.
