I hate it when people refer to the ones they hang out with as "support groups." Like wtf does that even mean. If they're people you enjoy being around, call those motherfuckers "FRIENDS." This may seem like a no-brainer, but I can't even begin to bitch enough about how artificial this place gets once everything simple has a bs label.
