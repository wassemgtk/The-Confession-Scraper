No matter how much I tell myself otherwise, I honestly do not feel smart enough to be here. I'm thankful to be here, but I don't think I deserved it. It's my third year here and I still feel this way. *gasp* :( I wonder if it would have been better for society/world if someone else had been in my place, and been able to accomplish more than I have.
