Last year I tried to go to the Moving Day parties but my social anxiety got the best of me. Now I keep trying to move on, but my mind constantly goes back to that moment when I couldn't bring myself to go. It's horribly painful and makes me feel pathetic. I can't do this basic shit that comes SO TRIVIALLY easy to everyone else. How am I supposed to make it through the next 3 years of MIfucking-T?
