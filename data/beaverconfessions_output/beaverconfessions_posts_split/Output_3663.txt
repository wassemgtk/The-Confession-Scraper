I have a secret fantasy wherein Trump becomes president and all the leftists move to Canada (notice, never Mexico) as promised. America flourishes with the protestant work ethic restored. Traditional family values take society off of its death spiral and return it to a time when men, women, and children coexisted beneficially. Whites stop apologizing for being successful and stop capitulating to the whims of a vocal minority. The government is once again a small affair, and it concerns itself less with the workings of its citizens' lives and more with solidifying America's status in the world economically and ideologically. The media drops its leftist agenda. People stop watching the TV and start reading newspapers again. Winning is no longer a bad word; protecting your family and your nation is the honorable thing to do; veterans are again held in high esteem; charity is the new welfare, not least because manufacturing is a renewed American enterprise as a result of improved trade deals. 

This is all possible. Please keep your word and move to Canada. I'm sure Trudeau is awaiting you eagerly with rainbow flags and little special snowflake confetti.
