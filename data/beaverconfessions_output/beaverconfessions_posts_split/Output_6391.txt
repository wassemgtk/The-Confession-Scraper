I was very sick for two weeks. The replies I got when I got in touch with S^3 and my four professors telling them when I would finish my work? 1) Drop my class, 2) I'm giving you a zero on the exam you missed and you should drop my class, 3) I'm giving you a zero on the exam you missed, 4) silence. S^3 is being less than helpful right now. This is super frustrating and isolating and is not helped by my depression/anxiety.

I'm lucky because I have a great support network of friends, but it's strange that this community always seems confused and surprised when there's a suicide. Sometimes the only thing keeping me from that is a friend who happened to check in at the right time, and I know I'm not the only one. This was already an issue, but callous profs aren't helping.
