I came into MIT so excited to learn and meet people, and I'm still excited to learn and meet people, but now overlying that is a sense of I'm not doing enough or I'm not good enough. I look around and everyone's doing such cool things and I feel like I have to also do those things, but I have no inherent desire to do them. When I started this year, I told myself I would not let my surroundings tell me what's best for me, but I already find that MIT has reshaped what I think I need. How do you get rid of this institutional influence? I just want to be me.
