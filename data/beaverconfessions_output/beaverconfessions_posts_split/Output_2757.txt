I'm so in love with Ka Wai Lee. When I found out she had a boyfriend today, I was heartbroken. I still remember the memory as clearly as a flashbulb memory (9.00). I was cooking mushrooms in butter and I could feel my heart melting with the butter. And then I ate it. After this, I cried in my room and my tears caused water damage on my laptop. Now I can't finish my psets and I have to go in to tech help. I told my mom that I dropped my laptop in the toilet, but actually, I dropped in my heart. Pls help
