I had some BS happen in highschool when I applied here. Background. My dad is white and my mom is half black half white. So I'm 3/4 white and 1/4 black. I'm pale, you can tell I'm part black when I grow my hair out but I tend to keep it short and everyone who doesn't know me assumes I'm a tan white guy, and usually they guess I'm Italian. When I applied my guidance counselor who was white tried to get me to put down black as my race. I pointed out that I look white and am mostly white so white made the most sense. He persisted and made the argument that I've had a "tough time" as a "person of color" in life, so I should do it to "help ease the admissions process". I'm from a rich Jewish long island suburb I've been very fortunate. So I want to say to all white people out there who I one of, black people are not your little pity cases. Doing someone a favor for no reason other then them being black is condescending. Stop trying to be a white savior. If you really want to help black people then stop trying to tell them what race they are and that they are victims. I'm not a victim, maybe some of my ancestors were, but I'm far from it, I'll pull myself up by my own bootstraps.
