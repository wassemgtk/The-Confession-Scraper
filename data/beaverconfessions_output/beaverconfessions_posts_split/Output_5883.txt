As a nearsighted person, I'm appalled by the continuing prevalence of Halloween costumes that involve eyeglasses.  Does nobody else realize how offensive and insensitive these costumes are to me - a person who has to go through the grueling ordeal of staggering around my room every morning, virtually blind, feeling for my eyeglasses? Surely, the MIT community must recognize that these costumes make a mockery of me and my condition.  

I've spoken to some other individuals who share my disability, and many of them expressed that they do not feel offended by these appropriative costumes.  Yet, their individual offense is neither necessary nor expected for recognizing offensiveness in general.  It doesn't matter whether they're offended, or even whether the majority of nearsighted individuals are offended.  The only thing that matters is that MIT must make a safe learning space for everyone - including me, and including other nearsighted people who are offended by these costumes, who I'm sure exist but just aren't vocal enough to speak up for themselves.  And as the most easily-offended nearsighted individual in this community, I get the privilege of deciding what is or isn't appropriate here.
