Seeing the students of MIT take the time out of their psetting, studying, and general MIT lives to show the prefrosh how amazing this place can be has truly demonstrated the caring and genuine character of MIT. Making CPW happen was difficult, but it became a great reset for my perception of MIT. Y'all are amazing, and I'm so glad to be a part of this magical magical home.
