I just graduated here a year ago and I have a great job now thanks to the internships I did here. I have grown worried at the movement to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour that I've witnessed over the past year because of where I was. When I started my first job here freshman year I had no real skills and got minimum wage. It was lousy pay for lousy work but it got my foot in the door. I got some skills and the next internship took me because of the first one for double the minimum wage. The third took me for more, then after graduating I got a good business job for good pay and benefits which they agreed to because of my experience. Nobody would have hired me the first time for $15 an hour because I was not worth it, I would have been stuck either doing an unpaid internship, or none at all. Some people argue that minimum wage is not a living wage. Of course it's not, that's the point. Minimum wage jobs are not about making a living, they are about giving workers with no skills a foot in the door to begin building them. Plus most low wage jobs are in industries such as restaurants and supermarkets that are very low margin businesses that rely on low wages to stay profitable. When you raise the minimum wage you make the workers with the least skills compete against workers with more skills and the low skills ones take the punishment. Employers will either hire fewer low level workers, cut their hours, or both as a result. So please don't push for a higher minimum wage, it may feel good, but it does not do good.
