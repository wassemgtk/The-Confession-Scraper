I prefer problem sets over people. Problem sets won't break your heart. Or steal food from your fridge. Or fake competence without having any. Or waste your time gossiping about the next transient relationship. Or complain incessantly about things beyond their power. Or... I think you get where I'm going. 

Where my misanthropes at!?
