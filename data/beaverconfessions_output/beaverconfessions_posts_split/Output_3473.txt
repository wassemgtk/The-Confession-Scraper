Okay so let me tell you of a story of 30 days ago. It was a Friday at 6 pm - I distinctly remember this.  I was going up the green building to meet up with a friend, because we wanted to go on a roof, right? So we decide to meet up on the 9th floor at the lounge area, somewhere completely empty right? WRONG. It was PACKED high with people, so many people. They were having one of those... Ida Green Tea sessions and oh my gosh /literally/ everyone from eaps was there, and I don't use the word literally wro- wait there was one person who wasn't there. Yeah... that one grad student whose door I unlocked on the 18th floor. It wasn't like I used magic on it or anything, I had the actual key to it because the radar gear was in the room, and for some other reason that person was there. Yeah... talk about awkward. But not as awkward as when I went into that room.. boy did one of these things not belong.
