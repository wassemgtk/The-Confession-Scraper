People get shit for expressing opinions anonymously and "not attaching their name" to it, but I think that's like justifying privacy invasions because "if you're innocent you have nothing to hide".

There's no shame in anonymity. Anonymity is good! It fights groupthink and encourages honesty. I have opinions that I wouldn't express publicly, not because I'm scared of backlash, but because I value my relationship with people who I'd offend. And I don't think that's dishonest, I think it's socially conscionable, respectful, and human.

So don't attack people for not having the "courage" to state something publicly, even if there are sassy style points to be won. There are lots of reasons why they might prefer this forum.
