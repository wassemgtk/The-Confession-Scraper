I have two beds in my room, because once my (probably ex by the time this is posted) girlfriend said she would come sleep with me sometimes. But she never came.  (By sleeping, I do mean sleep. I don't mean sex nor anything related)

I wish I haven't moved from a double to a single now... It feels too lonely.  Sometimes I sleep in the lounge just to have the company of other people.

I jokingly invite friends to sleep in my room, really wishing one of them would say yes.   I have trouble sleeping now that I'm feeling very depressed, and having someone sleeping near me relaxes me, and makes me incredibly happier. 

I wish someone reading that would come sleep in my room or invite me to theirs. I can make you breakfast if you want :)...
