Normally when a tragedy happens I prefer to mourn and not go into the blame game and get political. However tonight Obama came on and said we should politicize the events in Oregon. You want to get political? Fine, the gloves are off Mr. President. 

Lets start with some facts. 
1. Murder is at a decades low in this country and continues to drop.

2. Guns laws have become much looser in recent decades and murder continues to drop lower and lower.

3. Mexico has some of the strictest gun laws in the world yet has the highest murder rate of any developed nation.

The truth is you can't stop crazy people from doing crazy things by passing crazy laws, that's crazy. Gun control does not work, in fact the opposite solution may be better, and that college was a "gun free" zone.
