to the person living in the single next to me...You're always so quiet but I always wonder if you can hear my frantic phone calls to my parents and the conversations I have with my friends, or the weird music I play at 3 am, or the arguments I have with my boyfriend. I wonder if you have this strange window into my life when I barely ever hear anything from your side of our common wall...
