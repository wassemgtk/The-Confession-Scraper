@5867 It is possible that you are getting the software dev. positions partly because you attend MIT. From someone who left school early and then chose to go back and finish the degree- stick with it. If you've lost interest in the courses, engage with your professors more and explore topics that come up in conversation. A lot of our experiences are shaped by our mindsets so when you catch yourself thinking that "this is so boring, I have to take this class," try instead, "this is so exciting, I get to take this class!" Things will improve if you engage more. I promise.
