I needed to vent. This is where. 

I'm increasingly frustrated by the decisions made I by the black community in large. This rant is mostly inspired by the fact that the black community is giving away the nomination to Hillary Clinton. The damage may have already been enough to sink Bernie. African Americans gave away the southern states in risk oculus margins, and are the only thing that has kept Clinton afloat and winning. I just don't understand how the black community can ignore a man that walked with MLK and has been an active civil rights protestor for literally all of his adult life. Instead, the black community is giving away the nomination to a women who, while Sanders protested in in UChicago, worked for the campaign of a Republican. She and her husband signed into law the 'crack down on crime' bill. She's called black youth super predators. She has private jail interests giving her money. This is all aside from the 'general' reasons why Bernie is a better candidate, like not being beholden to special interests, being on the right side of the Iraq War and disastrous trade agreements like NAFTA (which Bill Clinton signed into law), and being pro-gay marriage even when it was unpopular (Hillary didn't 'evolve' until 2013!). It's just ridiculous to me that the black community is failing so miserably at recognizing who's in their best interest and causing that person to lose. This alone is representative of the overall ignorance and lack of organization of the black community in large. Black leaders, BLM, and other black organizations should be doing a much better job of informing the people who they are supposed to serve. This leads to Black Lives Matter. I just cant fathom how awfully they are set up. For one - the name. Like seriously, nobody recognized the danger and oh so obvious "all lives matter" 'rebuttal' to "Black Lives Matter"? Yes this is pure arrogance for those who use that 'argument', but why leave your whole movement open to such easy dismissive slogans. Moreover, its moves are more often than not disorganized and too open to criticism. Like the riots or the time that the black class president made ridiculous claims that the KKK was on campus. It's obvious that the media and people are often biased and over analyze these sorts of situations, and the blame is also squarely on their shoulders for perverting certain actions or slogans to dismiss the entire movement, but I just wish that they gave the media and racists less material to undermine them with. Anyway, end of rant. If you vote in a primary in the month of April and March (looking at you NY, California, Oregon, and Washington) register so you can vote in the primary! Deadlines for registration are normally around two or three weeks before hand.
