I can't help but feel that MIT cultivates an unhealthy focus on mental health a little bit. Like we're surrounded by this from posters to this page to the many organizations. I understand the need for it, and have gone through similar things while here. I'm not for the duck syndrome like Stanford, but being surrounded by misery and focus on misery makes me miserable. Five people on my living group of thirty have told me that they tried to kill themselves at some point. This can't be normal.
