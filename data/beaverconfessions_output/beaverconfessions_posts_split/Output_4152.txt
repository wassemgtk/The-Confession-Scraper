Does anyone feel that there are certain ethnicities specifically in certain areas of campus? For example, hispanics in this dorm, asians in that dorm? And if so, is this a bad thing? I feel like sometimes I've noticed a lot of cliques and exclusiveness in certain dorms...don't know how to feel about it...
