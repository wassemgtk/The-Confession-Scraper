I feel that MIT has made me less excited about learning. I'm just so stressed all the time trying to get all of my assignments finished that I have no time to actually enjoy what I'm doing or think about the wonder and the amazing implications of these topics. I feel like maybe I could learn more if I were somewhere else that actually valued me as a person and learner.
