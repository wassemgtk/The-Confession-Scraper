All of the unhappiness people I know have one thing in common. They blame anyone and anything but themselves for their problems. I've been down the blame road too, seeing myself as a victim of person or circumstance. But I found that taking responsibility for everything that happens in your life is difficult at first, then it becomes empowering and makes you a much stronger more capable person. I know that some problems may not be your fault. At the end of the day, only you can solve them by changing yourself, not someone or something else.
