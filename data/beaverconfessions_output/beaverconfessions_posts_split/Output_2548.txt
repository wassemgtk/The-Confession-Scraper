For those of you crucifying the freshman council- cut it out.  I am all for political correctness, but the stuff you are publicly shaming them for is ridiculous.  if they dropped a slur, fine, but they didn't.  they said "inner city kids"-- which has no bounds on skin color.  hell, they could have been inner city kids, and been told they had no direction.  how dare you insinuate their privilege based on what? their skin color? if anything that is the most screwed up part about all of this.  

in addition, how many mit students post "gangster" pictures of themselves and no one says a word.  but someone who has spent their entire freshman year dedicated to serving the class, making their lives better, "slips" up once, which barely qualifies as a slip up, and you go into full combat mode.  one simply could have inboxed them and said they found it offensive but NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO. lets publicly repost it 5+ times and make them villains.

YOU decided to feel that this was offensive.  YOU decided to make them scape goats.  with no basis.  none at all.  pick your battles, especially with people that don't spend the majority of their time trying to make student life better.
