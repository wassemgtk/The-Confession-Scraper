My FSILG really saved me this year. If I hadn't joined, I would've spent most my days sitting in my room, eating irregularly, and not talking to anyone. They really saved me from a deep depression. I'm actually social now (social for me at least), and I feel like I have a purpose being involved in the community. I finally feel like I have a place I can call home.
