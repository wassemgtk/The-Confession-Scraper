I have a great friend who has some very interesting turns of phrase.  He'll walk into a room or join a conversation and greet us with the colloquialism "what's gucci?" but with an unexpected twist: he won't say the "i" sound at the end of "gucci."  Yes, he begins conversations with "what's gooch?"
Obviously this leaves me somewhat conflicted and confused.  Is he asking a question for clarification, essentially seeking the answer to what IS a gooch?  Maybe he is unaware of the sheer gravity of what he's saying, and is unwittingly uttering the name of a very important but usually unexplored part of the body.  Or perhaps he knows, but is making the sacrifice in credibility to maintain brevity in conversation.  I'm not sure, and I may never know, but he's a good guy all the same.
