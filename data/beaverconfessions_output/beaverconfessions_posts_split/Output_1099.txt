A troupe of howler monkeys would have behaved better than the audience at the ADT show. Seriously, is it necessary to shriek your friends' name incessantly throughout their show, or act like you're hailing a cab? I understand that you want to support your friends, but you can do that by paying attention while they are performing, and limiting your shrieking and chanting to before and after each dance. SHUT UP YOU MOTHERFUCKING SAVAGES YOU'RE RUINING THE SHOW FOR EVERYONE ELSE
