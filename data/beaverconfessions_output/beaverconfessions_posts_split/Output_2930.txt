Really getting sick of my conservative friends here playing victim and whining about how people say they shouldn't dress up in certain costumes on halloween because of "cultural appropriation". The key to fighting jerks who try to use that tumblr nonsense as a weapon is call them out on what they are implying. When they should you are being insensitive to minorities ask them why minorities need special treatment. They usually respond with something along the lines of historical and modern oppression. Then call them out on what they really mean. Say in a baby voice, "Those poor little victims! They can't make it in society on their own! They need good white folks like us to help them!" That's what these sjw really mean, they subconsciously look down on minorities as their inferiors and think that they should be the white saviors. In short they are paternal racists, they look at inferiority as a good, not bad thing. Say it to their faces. They will either not know how to respond, or get angry, completely lose it and scream incoherently at you, make a scene, and make themselves look bad. When they do, roll you eyes, smile at them condescendingly, wish them well, and walk off. This happens because most of them are very emotional people with poor self control.
