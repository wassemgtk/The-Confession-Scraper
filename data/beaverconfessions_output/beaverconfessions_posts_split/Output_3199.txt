What's up with 2019 sweatshirts? You think if we paid a whole freaking month ago they would have come by now at least. Is the 2019 class council just coming up with some perfect algorithm so distributing sweatshirts won't become the trainwreck 2017 jackets almost became or they're just being stubborn and saying it was the former class council's job? If they haven't panicked enough from the flame war I say we should start it again ;)
