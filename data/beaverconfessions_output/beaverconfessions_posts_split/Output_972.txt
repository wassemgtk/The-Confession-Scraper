Time for some finals week positivity!  Who is the most interesting fellow undergrad that you have met at MIT so far?  "Interesting" is meant in this context to have a positive connotation; as in "unique", "eccentric," "individual," or "extraordinary."  Don't explicitly name them if you don't want to.  General anecdotes are sufficient!
