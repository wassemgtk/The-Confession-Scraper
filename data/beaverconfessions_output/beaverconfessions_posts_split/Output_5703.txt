BDS Israel!!!
Israel is the devil! Let’s BDS the shit out of them!!!
I totally support the BDS movement that calls for Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions against Israel.
I think Israel deserves to suffer financially for its war crimes, so help me cripple it economically by joining me and many others in the BDS movement!

My only problem with the current state of the BDS movement is that it’s too soft on Israel. I don’t understand why we are such amateurs. Let’s take this movement to the next level and really prevent every single dollar from getting into Israel. 

If we really want to be true with ourselves and BDS then this is what I suggest we do:
1) Boycott Facebook, after all, Facebook has offices in Israel. So by using Facebook we contribute money to a company that then pays salaries to Israelis. So no more Facebook.
2) Boycott Google, after all, Google has offices in Israel and they pay salaries to their Israeli employees. So no more using Google products.
3) Boycott Microsoft, after all, Microsoft has offices in Israel and they pay salaries to Israelis. This shit has to stop. So no more Microsoft products. (Notice that by now we’re starting to run out of technology to use).
4) Let’s not go into the financial industry, because almost all financial firms use Bloomberg’s services. The founder and owner is Michael Bloomberg, a big supporter of Israel. By using Bloomberg we are giving him money that eventually makes its way to Israel. So no more Bloomberg and Wall Street stuff.
5) Next time we go to Vegas, let’s not step foot in the Venetian Hotel, since the owner, Sheldon Adelson, is extremely pro-Israeli and donates a lot of money to them.
6) Boycott Intel, after all, they have a big office in Israel. But, fuck it, most computers contain Intel processors, so no more using computers.

Ok, that’s fine, I don’t really need all of the above. I’m a student at MIT, I can take classes here using only a pen and paper and reinvent all of this technology by myself. I just need to take 6.046 to help me with the algorithms.

7) Oh shit, gotta boycott 046 because all three professors are Israelis. Fuck it, I kind of liked that class.
8) Boycott MIT. Come on?! MIT too?! Yes, my friend, also MIT. MIT pays salaries to its Israeli professors and allows Israeli students on campus. I know, a real crime against humanity. So, gotta drop out of MIT.

Ok, I’m going back to live in a cave. BDS Israel!!
Bye.
