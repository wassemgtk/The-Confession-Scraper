I feel like I've hurt the people with whom I've had a past relationship. Not because I abused them or anything scary and evil and disgusting like that. It's just that I feel like I've been selfish, and didn't really think about their feelings as much as mine. But I vow to not do that again. I promise the next person I can call my significant other that I will love and cherish them for as long as our relationship lasts.
