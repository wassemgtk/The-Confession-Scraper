DON'T GO SAILING AT MIT'S SAILING PAVILION IF YOU THINK YOU NEED JUST EVEN A TEENY BIT OF HELP TO SAIL. My friend had taken sailing last semester and I'm taking it right now, and we thought it would be fun to go to sail since the weather has gotten warmer. Since it's been a while since she sailed and I only had sailed two times before, we of course made a few mistakes and had a few questions while rigging, especially when our boat didn't have the ball at the end to secure the back of the sail with. We watched the video that was put up, but obviously a 5 minute video isn't going to guarantee you know how to do everything. The guy there got all blustery and said, "I'm not an instructor, you guys should know how to do this, here let me just do everything" and when my friend said she was a little hazy since she took sailing last semester and the guy said "THAT'S NO EXCUSE" and continued to mutter under his breath as he worked around our boat, and said forcefully what he was doing like he wished us to disappear. 
I get that the sailing pavilion gets a lot of people who want to sail who might need help and there's not enough staff to do that and they have other things to do, but we didn't have to be treated like we had no right to be there.
On that note, are any of the sailing instructors ever at the sailing pavilion to help when not during sailing classes? I want to go sailing on my own outside of class again to just practice and enjoy sailing because I'm a hands-on learner versus a video learner, but now I'm pretty reluctant to go if there aren't people who are willing to be at least a little patient with me while I try to remember how to sail on top of the MIT workload. Sailing was supposed to be a destressor at MIT for me and remind there's life outside of academics, but now it seems like another feature of the hellhole MIT sometimes looks like.
