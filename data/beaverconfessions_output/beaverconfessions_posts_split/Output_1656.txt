Dear #6638 (half-eaten cookies guy),
You're the picture of evil in my mind. I thought this place was made up of nice people who cared about each other and valued each other as people rather than as objects. I don't prioritize my appearance because I'm busy trying to be a useful, kind, and interesting person, but that doesn't mean that your general insult to all of the women at MIT didn't hurt me personally.
Sincerely, 
Disappointed Cookie
