In response to #2642: I went to the talk on Palestinian Reality and Israel Impunity this weekend. It really blew my mind. I want to summarize some of the things that stood out the most to me. These are coming from Noam Chomsky and Mads Gilbert - both extremely respected and knowledgeable on the matter (you may disagree with Gilbert, but I hope you will still consider his words since he's been actually there for 8 years. At the very least, you can probably trust in Chomsky).

Besides hearing personal stories, one of the hardest hitting statistics was that Israel has killed > 1300 Palestinian citizens, most of which were civilians, including 500 children. Whereas in the same time frame there have been 13 Israeli deaths, 10 of which were soldiers. I'm not saying that ANY person's life matters more than another, or that we should tally up lives, but this difference is staggering. The UN has rules even in times of war. These include for instance minimizing civilian casualties and not attacking hospitals. But Israel's last attack specifically targeted hospitals and ambulances, and even UN shelters. In Israel's Dahiya Doctrine, they state that their aim is to cause as much destruction and loss of Arab life as possible. This is not an acceptable defensive strategy, on the contrary it is in direct violation of human rights and UN law. According to Chomsky, most of the world's countries have recognized this and are against Israel's actions, but are unable to do anything against the superpower that is the US.

I would strongly recommend watching the whole talk if you're looking for the other opinion. It's the most compelling argument I've heard. It's also pretty rigorous - every piece of information is cited. I'm not blindly asking you to believe their claims, but at least the citations and the identities of the speakers should encourage you to not immediately discard the claims, and do further research on your own.
