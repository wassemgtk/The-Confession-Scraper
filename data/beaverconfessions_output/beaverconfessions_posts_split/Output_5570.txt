The biggest regret of my life is treating you like shit. I loved you so much, but I don't know why it was so hard for me to show you. You've been gone for so long now, but hearing how you pretend to not know of me hurts a shit ton. I still have the fondest of memories of you, and I know those won't fade for a long time. I guess I just thought that was kind of mutual. 

Regardless of what you think of me, I will always see you as the love of my life. It's too bad you don't know what the good old days are until they're over.
