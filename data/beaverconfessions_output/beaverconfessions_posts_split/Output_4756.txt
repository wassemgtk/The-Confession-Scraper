i told a friend of mine that’ve i’ve been clinically depressed for a while now. she then told another mutual friend (ish?) of ours. This second friend later commented (*probably without knowing I was in hearing range) that she’s almost certain that I’m lying because “depressed people don’t just /not/ tell anyone”.

im not even angry; i mostly just wish i knew why they think I would lie about something like this, especially when I’ve never been one to be very forthcoming when it comes to personal matters.
