Is it bad that I prefer classes to UROPs and working on my own projects and stuff, especially as a course 2? People say you learn more from following your passions but I'm either a) not very passionate or b) too lazy to go to a lab or shop and work on something (so not passionate enough to bother). I just want to take all the classes. I'm not even doing well in them, so it's not like I have a perfect GPA to balance out my lack of projects when it comes to a job interview...
