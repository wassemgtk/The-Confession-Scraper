MIT is great and I get that we learn a lot here, but I hate how much this school can bring down me and my friends. I always feel like we're being depleted of a normal college life, and when my friends are sad about schoolwork I absolutely hate that all I can do is empathize with them. I would give the world for my friends to be well-rested and healthy, but I can't make psets go away and I can't buy more time for sleep. I don't know whether to give them space or to comfort them without changing their situation. Bad days get a whole lot worse when my friends are sad.
