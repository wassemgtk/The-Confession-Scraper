Every semester I've been here I've gotten an email from a concerned professor about my performance. This year both times it happened I just got really annoyed, even though I know they mean well. I've accepted that I'm a C student, because MIT forced me to. I recently switched to the flexible version of my major with a HASS minor so I wouldn't have to take hard classes anymore, but even now on 36 units of easy classes, even with all that extra time to commit to individual classes and the lack of sleep deprivation, I'm still getting that email. But it's still so much better than how it used to be, when I tried to be a normal MIT student taking a normal 48 units while taking all the classes required for my major. I worked my ass off, got lots of help, went to office hours, went to S3, never slept, went to Mental Health and got a prescription for Adderall, generally did everything right and then some, and still barely passed my classes, assuming you count a D as passing. It sucked. Maybe if I went back to that lifestyle on my lighter courseload I could be an A-B student, but I was so fucking miserable, and it's not worth it. If a low GPA is the price for my sanity, I'll take it. My blood pressure dropped almost 30 points from near-hypertension levels back to pre-MIT levels when I made that transition. I refuse to go back.

But I still have to meet with my professor to talk about how to fix my apparently problematic grades, which was a shock because I was enjoying that class. For the first time I was understanding what I was learning in a technical class, and I got full credit on some pset and exam problems, which is also a first. This professor is so much nicer than other professors too. I'm so used to being treated with contempt by professors, but he treats me with respect and it's such a shock. I don't know what to tell him. Usually the message I get from these meetings is, "just get higher scores." Guess I just have to grin and bear it like always and flounder my way to graduation.

IHTFP is not a cute little thing with double meaning for me. I genuinely, deeply, hate this fucking place.
