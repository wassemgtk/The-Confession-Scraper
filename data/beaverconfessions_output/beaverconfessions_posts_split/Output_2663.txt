@5676 Yes, the security policies are terrible. But as far as I can tell, the reason getting 40 people to sacrifice their time wouldn't be because anyone likes the security policies, or even that not enough people care. It's that trying to fight it WOULDN'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE.

The deans have admitted that the policy is blatantly just about liability, and not a result of any actual concern for students. Which is terrible, but MIT is a cooperation, and at least they're being honest about it. So they keep forcing their RLADs to send nasty emails that give students anxiety, "Shit, I forgot to yell at my friend for not tapping her ID! Am I going to get kicked out? Agh!" And they're going to keep ignoring giant student polls showing that everyone hates the security and that people don't actually feel more secure. And they're going to keep their dumb security policy that ensures that students have to constantly police and mistrust their friends, or risk getting kicked off of campus.

Because guess what? MIT can't get sued now, and that's really important here.
