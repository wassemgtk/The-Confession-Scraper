Call me Seven. Not related with my name. I am typical me. I am unique. Because I believe there's no other Seven in this world. But people could say I am lucky but they didn't know that I am just an ordinary girl. I am chinita. My mother says I have a certain kind of loveliness. Tall and I do have a white complexion. I joined beauty pageants when I was in my teen years. I'm not boasting myself. I'm just being myself. My parents separated when I am twenty. There's third party involved. So, as I go along, I realised that there's really no forever. Here my story goes: 
I met him online. To be specific on tagged. I don't know if you guys know it.  But I am pretty sure most of you does. I got star struck so I added him. I am single so I am searching friends online. And honestly, I love to have babies with blue eyes. (Ambisyosa! :D) I was glad when he accepted my request and we chatted from tagged to Skype. I told him my experience in love and how I was left broken by my  boy friends. He felt sad for me. Until we became close and I asked him to make a Facebook account so it would be easy for me to contact him. Months passed he courted me and I didn't reject him for I felt the same way too. But what made me sad when he asked me to show my b****. I'm not that type of girl so all our plans vanished. He even want me to travel to their place to meet him. Its really funny that I am the girl but he won't help me to come and see him. He would always say I am stupid. So, I let him go. And now I am still heartbroken. I know God has a plan for me. I may not be the girl he need but at least I'm not cheating on him. Weeks passed I learned that he  found a new girl from Philippines. I was being humiliated and betrayed that time. I walked to my cr and cried. I asked to myself "why boys are all like that?" I do hope he won't hurt her. As of now, we are chatting as friends. I don't know why I am so stupid to talk to him while I'm still hurt. They say that if two past lovers can remain friends, it's either they are still in love, or never were. I just hate myself for being stupid. Can I ask? Do I need to change myself? I am so conservative that almost everybody left me hanging.
To A :
Be the best that you can. I understand your needs. I am sorry for not giving you everything. I love you, goodbye.
