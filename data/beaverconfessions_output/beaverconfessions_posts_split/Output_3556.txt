So after seeing that post on nationalism, I thought people who post a lot of political stuff on here might want to watch this: https://www.ted.com/talks/jonathan_haidt_on_the_moral_mind?language=en

tl;dr liberals tend to value not harming others and fairness over authority, in-group loyalty, and purity whereas conservatives are the opposite.

While I'm pretty liberal (read: extremely) and don't agree with everything in the video, I think it was valuable to understand what conservatives value and why they might believe that certain things (e.g. nationalism) are more important than others (e.g. being humanitarian). Though I may not agree that they are more important, I can see why people support authority, purity, and loyalty--these kinds of things are what helps hold our society together. Just being nice is not always enough to build something--you need rules too (obviously you need to be nice when you have rules though...both parts are necessary to create a real society). Conservatives tend to value what has been established in the past, and what people in authority say--because that's what keeps society stable. Liberals realize the status quo has problems and tries to change that, but conservatives don't like it because it's destroying what has been built or betraying the group that they belong to. Both sides are important, and I think we need to do better to understand what goals and values we have in common and use that to better understand each other, rather than writing people off as completely irrational. 

To the conservatives out there though, I also want to say that I hope you can try to understand why liberals might value avoiding harm and being fair more than following established norms. Established norms are often flawed based on who was in power in the past, and result in unfair treatment of many groups of people. And ultimately, @the nationalism person, I think diversity and connecting with other people is a good thing because things like countries and races are really just arbitrary borders we've decided when in truth we are all just human beings on one team. What reason do we have for competing with other countries when there are things we could learn from each other and help each other with. I think nationalism has its cons in that many people support their country blindly, despite its flaws, and treat other countries as competitors or enemies when we should be working together.
