I am a freshman, and I feel that my world is tearing apart now. All the other freshmen that I know of are always with friends and being so happy, while I'm here alone, because no one wants to be with me. The few ¨friends¨ that I've made throughout the last month never want to hang out with me, and I'm even being ignored in social media by them. I'm really worried that this feeling is only going to get bigger and bigger, and it may never stop. Sucks to be the weird kid...
