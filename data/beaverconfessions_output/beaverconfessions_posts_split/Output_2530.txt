I've been having trouble sleeping for the past 3-4 months now.  I'll have nothing to do at around 1 am, and then I'll be awake until around 6 am, and then miss almost all my classes when I wake up at around 1-2 pm.  Maybe I'm lazy and just not disciplined, but I feel like I really need help.  I'm afraid to go to S^3 after all the horror stories I've heard from people going there, but I don't think I can keep doing this for much longer.  Can someone please give me some advice?
