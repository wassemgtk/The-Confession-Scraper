I made confession earlier about my concern with too many willing to expand power to the president with Obama in office, while not thinking about what a Republican president would do with such power. One commenter asked what limits I would like to see passed from congress on the president. The first would be limits on military power. While Obama has been in office we have launched airstrikes, drone strikes, and special forces teams in Syria, Iraq, Yemen, Tunisa, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. All without congressional permission. If you want to go to war with these nations or groups within them declare it, a single figure should not all of sudden be able to summon a force that has a few thousand nukes waiting to be fired on any spot for reasons not agreed on by the elected congress. I for one want to see congress pass a law stating the president cannot use military force against an enemy unless congress declares war, or they directly fire on Americans. And in that case, you can only go after the shooters, not everyone who they ever encountered. Or a general provision to laws passed stating that any item not explicitly covered by law does not apply. For example, you can't say the clean water act which stated that it was only in use for navigable waters, ie commercial boats and argue it gives you the right to regulate a pond in someones backyard because it may flood into a river during a storm. I know someone will always try to twist words, but the point is to put obstacles in their way to make it an easy court case against them. Now, even if you agree with everything Obama has done, do you want a Republican to have that power someday? I don't.
