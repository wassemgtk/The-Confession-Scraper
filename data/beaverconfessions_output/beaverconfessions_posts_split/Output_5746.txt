PSA: If you close your door by just pulling the doorknob and walking off and letting physics take over, you are probably slamming it.  I'm tired of getting woken up by "BAM BAM BAM" that continues for a full 2 minutes straight (btw, why are you closing your door that many times at 3 am).  Did your parents not stop you when you slammed your door growing up? Because you slam the door at least 20 times a day and my wall shakes at least a few times a day from it.

And this isn't even unusual, I have seen a lot of people closing doors this way at MIT, like about 10% or so.  And I have lived next to 2 of them.  (I'm a senior who has moved around a lot - almost one move a year so I have had a lot of neighbors.)  Living next to them is horror.
