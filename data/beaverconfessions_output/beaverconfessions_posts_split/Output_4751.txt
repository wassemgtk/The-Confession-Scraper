I think Bernie Sanders' education plan will hurt our education system. A lot of poorer families can't afford to go to top schools like MIT, and if MIT doesn't give them the financial aid that makes them competitive with the free public universities, then they may not go because a better education isn't affordable.
You'll likely end up with what we used to have: only the rich kids go to the best schools. And lower tier private schools that are more affordable but not free won't be able to compete at all with the public schools covered by Bernie's plan, so they'll probably close. I'm posting this because it truly frustrates me that no one else has put this together. And no, I'm not a Republican or a supporter of Hillary. I'm actually not impressed with anyone this election season.
