I'm attracted to one of my close friends. I have been for about a year. I think that there was a period of time he had a thing for me too. But we kept missing each other. Sometimes dating other people, sometimes just being afraid to ruin what is a great friendship. Now though, just when I've finally gotten up the courage to go and tell him how I feel, I find out he's hooking up (casually) with one of my close friends. I don't want to lose either of their friendships, and so instead I pretend like everything's okay. But I can't stop thinking about how I missed my chance. It actually feels like its too late. I always thought that when he figured his shit out and so did I, there was a chance we could be together, and have something pretty fucking awesome. If only I had gathered up the courage to take a chance. Don't make the same mistake as me, friends. No matter how awkward, no matter how scary, tell people how you feel.
