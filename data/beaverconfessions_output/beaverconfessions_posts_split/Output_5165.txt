i got an extension on an assignment that i still didnt manage to complete by the later deadline
really this is insane i dont even know what i'm doing anymore
and im not even crying like jfc i should be sitting here balling my eyes out im going to fail a class that i really like 
i guess even my subconscious mind has realized that there's no point anymore
