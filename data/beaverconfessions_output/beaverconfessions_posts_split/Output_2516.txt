2 days after I had sex with my boyfriend, I realized that actually I didn't want to sleep with him. However, I felt deeply constrained to my actions since I hadn't told him to stop or whatsoever. I thought I wanted him, but then figured out I didn't, even while we were having sex. This idea started tickling my mind all the time, making me really uncomfortable. I talked to my best friend about it and she told me that I may have incurred sexual assult and should report him. When I mentioned this to another friend, he yelled at me saying that I'm a whimsical bitch. 

Since I'm extremely confused now I'm desperately looking for any advice.
