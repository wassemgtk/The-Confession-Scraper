I think the culture of trigger warnings and microagressions is fundamentally unhealthy. While in all cases, respect and consideration should determine what you say and how you say it, I despise the proposed fragility of it all. It does an immense disservice to people to imply hearing that "America is a land of opportunity" is an inappropriate sentance, for example. It encourages people to see themselves as made of glass, subject to shattering on one misplaced rock. This is not a key to good mental health, and I think it is linked to self-perpetuating behaviours that can make things like anxiety and depression even worse. But you know, that's just my opinion.
