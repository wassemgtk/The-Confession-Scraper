Maybe I smile because I like you, or him, or her, or just you all. Maybe I smile because crying inside is enough. Maybe I smile because I rather see that spread around than get help for myself. Maybe I smile because I know I can't save myself, but could save you. Maybe, just maybe, I had a nice day. It doesn't fucking matter why I smile.

Never overestimate a happy person's happiness. Sometimes we are the most damaged ones out there.
