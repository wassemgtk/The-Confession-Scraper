I want to get married. Everyone says you shouldn't get married in college, that you need to be dating for years and years before you should commit - but that's just another overarching expectation imposed on us by society. 
I love my significant other. This person has redefined all my emotions in a remarkably short amount of time - and I truly like the person I am now more than I did the person I was 6 months ago. I want to keep this. I know there's no rush, but I'm ready. I just don't know how to bring this up to them.
