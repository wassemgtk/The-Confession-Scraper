A lot of my family and friends are nervous about being the victim of a mass shooting. I want to say, please calm down. Mass shootings are very rare. As hard as it is to believe homicide is at a 30 year low in this country and keeps dropping every year. You are far more likely to die in a car accident then by a gun death, yet nobody panics getting into their car in the morning. Most people who are murdered are murdered by someone they know, not a stranger. Mass shootings are so rare, and make up less then 1% of all homicides in this country. It's so statistically low that you should be more worried about dying from a big fall, or rare cancers, which kill far more people. To give you an idea, roughly 10,000 people are murdered with guns in this country, mostly with small hand guns. This may sound like a lot, but we have around 70,000 people die in car accidents, 500,000 die from heart disease, another 500,000 from cancer, it goes on and on. The point is, pray, talk, and mourn these tragedies, but don't harm yourself by worrying about something so unlikely to happen. The media is making a circus out of it to make money.
