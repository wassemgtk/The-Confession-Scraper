If Trump isn't killed it's clear that he's going to be the next President. What happened in Chicago is a symptom of a much larger problem. Fear. I'm a Trump supporter, yet if I wore a hat on campus, I'm not sure if I would get beat up or worse. I have yet to meet someone who can convince me that he isn't the best candidate. I don't agree with everything he says, but I agree with most. To those who think anyone supporting Trump is irrational, I would ask you to consider whether your perspective is limited, and perhaps when leftists stop making me feel as though I will get killed we can have a discussion.
