Maybe they should change the name of Puppy lab to dog lab.. It's really Dissapointing to think you're going to be surrounded by adorable little puppies when in reality they are mature (well trained) stress dogs. I'm not saying I don't appreciate those dogs too but cmon puppies are the elixir of happiness
