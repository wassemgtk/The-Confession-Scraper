I googled how Halal food is made (because it's always served in a lot of the dining halls to accommodate religious people's diets) and I've got to say that's pretty fucked. An animal has to be fully conscious after being stabbed in the neck/gut so it can bleed out over a few agonizing minutes because a mystical book says that's the way it should be? Fucking insane.
