I have so much less energy for people than I used to and it means I'm losing friends. which should be ok, because quality over quantity, right? except then those people that I make an effort with don't seem to be making the same effort for me. and I'm just so sad because I get that their work is important and that they have other friends and other friend groups  but I just really need a friend right now and I have no idea who I can talk to.
