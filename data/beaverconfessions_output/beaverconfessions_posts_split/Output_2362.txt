So, I'm not out of the closet in the sense that I don't go around telling or talking about my sexuality.  I don't confirm anything or deny anything for that matter.  There's this guy who lives in the same dorm I live in but I have no clue if he likes me or not.  Should I ask him out? I think he knows I'm in the closet but he's out though and I don't want to make it hard for him or me. He'll be in the area next year but not at MIT so should I wait until then?  Hard life decisions.
