I just read a Reddit thread about things women are unaware about men and proceeded to think of every insecurity I've ever had. So here I am sitting alone in my room watching the little mermaid, browsing Reddit, crying and thinking of my ex, whom I'm amazed that she dated me. But then I had to force myself to stop crying just in case my roommate walked in. Fuck gender roles. Oh btw throughout the relationship I could never think of a reason why she was dating me.
