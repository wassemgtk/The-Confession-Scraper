I don't get how people can be so peppy and energetic and excited to see each other. Like, yeah I'll genuinely get that way for like 2 people at this place, but otherwise I'm just too exhausted and tired to try and crack and smile and act like I'm happy to see you, casual-acquaintance or friend-that-I'm-not-that-close-with.
I honestly do think most people here are insanely interesting, and I wish I knew them better, but that takes effort and fucks that I just don't have. No offense, y'all.
