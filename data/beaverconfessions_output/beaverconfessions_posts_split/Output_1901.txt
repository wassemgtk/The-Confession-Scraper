There's this girl I've started getting close to recently. She helped me get through my breakup with my girlfriend and was really there for me when I needed someone to be there for me. We've hung out a couple of times and I've always had fun and smiled and laughed when I'm with her, and I can't help but think that I'm starting to like her. The only problem is she's taken, and although I know for a fact that relationship is not stable, I don't want to be the one to break them apart. At the same time, I can't stop thinking about how great it would be to wake up next to her in the morning and just smile at how happy I would be
