I think I'm falling in love with a guy but I don't know if he could ever think of me that way. Despite the Simmons stereotype, he's a fantastic person to talk to, is a math major (awwwww yeah ;) ), loves guitar and music, sings like an angel, has this adorable baseball cap collection... But he has so many friends that are girls, I doubt he'd ever pay attention to me that way. I don't even care any more, I just have to tell someone how I feel. I'm in love with him. Should I ask him out? I'm thinking Valentine's day.
