To the black community, with all sincerity and respect: I feel really uncomfortable discussing race with black people. I feel in constant danger of sincerely pissing you off or of my opinions being written off as invalid because I'm white. 

You guys have had to deal with immeasurable injustice and that understandably greatly affects the way you see and interact with the world. But I think the strong feelings you have about this should facilitate greater discussion not smother it. Black people, and other minorities, are exactly who I should be talking to to really understand and educate myself about racism. I think its vital that people not be afraid to. 

I'm not saying don't be angry. Be angry. But know that I'm angry too. Our justice system is fucked, and I'm not okay with living in a country that doesn't truly protect all of its citizens. But please don't take lack of awareness as an affront. I for one, never knew how sheltered I was,  how much racism happened  in my community, and how some actions that I perceive as innocent can be viewed offensively by others.
