I find it significantly easier to make friends online than it is to make friends in person. As someone who actually cannot talk to people unless someone else talks to me first (and even then, it's difficult for me to carry on conversations), getting to someone anonymously through some text on a screen feels like a great way to start until we get closer and actually become friends. But because I have so many online friends, I feel complacent knowing I have people to talk to, but I also feel incredibly lonely because I don't really have any friends here. It's really hard to integrate into friend groups when everyone is already happy with their friends and don't need another awkward late addition to their group. And even then, I still feel like an outsider when I try. Somedays when I'm lying alone in my room talking to online friends, I really just wish I had someone nearby, a physical shoulder to cry on, or even being silent and just knowing that someone here knows I exist would be appreciated. I'm afraid I could die alone in my room someday and no one would know, and no one would care.
