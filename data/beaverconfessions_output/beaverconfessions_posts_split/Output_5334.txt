I'm thinking of withdrawing from MIT for a semester or two. CAP might also ask me to take a semester or two off, depending on how the next two weeks go. Will talking to S^3 about my options and concerns make CAP more likely to force me to withdraw? I don't want a forced withdrawal, I might be interested in a voluntary withdrawal. Also how hard is it to get back in?
