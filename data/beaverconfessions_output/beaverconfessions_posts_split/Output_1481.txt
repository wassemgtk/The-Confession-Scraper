My ex-boyfriend has an annoying habit of checking in how I am doing once in a year or so  at a random time, probably, because I had a mistake to break up politely "let's be just friends from now on" manner. It has been already a week I have not opened his FB message, and I would literally do anything else in this life than open it. Being in love with math myself, I used to godify this math genius for 4 years in my high-school and college, and seek his approval of quite a lot of my life and career decisions. Now, I am scared in case he does not approve or make fun of something I am doing now, although otherwise I am  confident in my career choices. 

2 years ago I met my fantastic boyfriend whom I hope to create family with.  Answering my ex's question about my private life makes me uncomfortable. Lying feels bad. Acknowledging the fact that 
there is someone more important for me now than he used to be, and disproving something we both used to belief, and my own "I love you" words feels bad.

 I wish him all best from the bottom of my heart, and I proudly preserved the ability of being sincerely happy for all his successes which he deserves. However, I wish never ever hear from him anymore. Don't know how to tell him this in a polite way.
