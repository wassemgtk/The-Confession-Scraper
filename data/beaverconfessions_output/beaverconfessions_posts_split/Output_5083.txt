I'm scared to like the Anne McCants post because I'm worried she or someone else on the Burton Conner house team will get wind of it and find some way to penalize me or my floor with some petty complaint.  Our experience with her has been so bad that I'm afraid to show any sort of dissent.  I know someone has to stand up to her, but I don't know how to do so without getting my floor in trouble too.
