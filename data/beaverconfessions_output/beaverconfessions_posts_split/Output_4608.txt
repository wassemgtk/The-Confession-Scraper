To the perplexed senior:

Wasn't your class the ones who were upset about the chi phi symbol on your ring? You're being hypocritical. 

I would prefer having a chi phi symbol on the ring over TMAYD, because at least it supports a whole frats worth of people rather than furthering one students agenda.
