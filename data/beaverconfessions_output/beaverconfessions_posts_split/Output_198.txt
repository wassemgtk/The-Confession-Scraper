I hate that I get sick every time I eat, that I can't risk eating breakfast or lunch before an exam. I hate that I can't sleep, that when I do sleep, I wake up gasping in fear every hour. I hate that I can't talk to anyone about my childhood, because I was raised not to talk about or show pain, and even with all the stupid things I've done at college, the only things I have regretted were days where I was vulnerable. I hate that I can't tell anyone how I feel, that I have to suffer alone. I hate that I know that I don't have to suffer alone but my fear and pride are too great to get help. I hate that I'm adopted. I hate that my best friend tried to kill herself. I hate that I can't kill myself, because every time I think about it, I remember that awful knot in my stomach when the phone call came, the way that nothing felt real. I hate that when I was in fifth grade I was afraid to love anyone because every time I had loved someone, they left me or died, and I thought I was cursed. I hate that I was verbally and physically abused by someone who was supposed to love me. I hate that every time I tried to leave he threatened me. I hate that he would force me to kiss him in public. I hate that I don't feel bad when I broke his heart. I hate that people won't leave me the fuck alone. I hate that I cry alone at night. I hate that no one who reads this will even think about me as they read it.

But I also love. I love the way that even without knowing any of this my friends will stand by me. I love the way they come visit me randomly and let me crash in their rooms without question. I love that I have someone to talk to if I ever overcome my fears. I love the way my friends hug me and laugh with me. I love the way no one ever tells me I'm unwanted anymore. I love the way I can feel sexy, happy, and fun without feeling guilty. I love that people like me, with or without my scars.
