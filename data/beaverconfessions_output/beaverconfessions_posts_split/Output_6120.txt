After being at MiT for a couple of years I've had a lot experiences that have redefined my self-identity as an academic and a person. We've all struggled here-okay *most* of us for one reason or another. We've all questioned ourselves and the Institute for what it *claims* to offer.

For me personally, I've constantly struggled here. My freshman year I chalked it up to not having a strong technical background. I didn't take AP Chem or higher level biology and those were the classes I got my fifth week flags in. As I was getting adjusted to just how rigorous (read: how absolutely fucking ridiculous) MiT work can be, sophomore year came. Once again I was flogged by work. Now in my major I chalked up to never seeing the material before, but sophomore year I realized, just like most people realize sophomore year, that something is up. MIT
may be ranked one of the greatest schools in the world but you wouldn't be able to tell that by the quality of the teaching. 

See, every homework assignment I've EVER gotten at MiT. I've had to google, I had to Wikipedia, I had to Internet. Every assignment required me to learn what ought to have been taught in class. The problems were never really elucidated by lecture. They just show where the hole is, and the homework throws you in. 
After a few years here I've gotten tired of it. When I see professors say "you'll learn through the Pset" I realize that's often a poor guise to cover their poor teaching. And as much as people may learn from really hard problems only loosely connected to the lecture, I don't. Relying on excessively hard problems to most of the value to your education is one size fits all solutions that fails to take into account people's differing learning styles or the fulfillment of the undergraduate experience. I learn from teachers. Not problems. Even if I did, with the constant rush to the next assignment or the next problem you don't have the time to dissect a problem for its moral of the story. Let's be honest, you  don't even have time to sleep here. 

Now say what you will about MiT needing to be "rigorous" or hard, but in reality, I've spent years here just googling. Now googling Isn't inherently a bad thing , but when I find other universities with far better notes and lectures than MiT-constantly-I have my doubts about the Institute. 
I have my doubts when I see all of us struggling to get by, when I see suicide after suicide, and realize we are some of the smartest people in the world. Yet, collectively we struggle here. Yes, we came here for a challenge and yes struggling is a great way to grow, but clearly the struggle here is an order of magnitude off.

Great researchers don't always make for great teachers. And yes, the idea of having the best in the world teach you sounds great...but I realize being taught by the best *teachers* in the world would be a helluva lot better.

I'm just writing this because I feel others can relate and this sentiment should be voiced
