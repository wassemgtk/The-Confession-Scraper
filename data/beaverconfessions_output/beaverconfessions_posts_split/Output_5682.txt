FUCK. MENTAL. HEALTH.

I've been having some trouble getting coursework done and finally decided to reach out to mental health to see if they could help me. I called to make an appointment but after being put on hold for 3 minutes was told that they would need to schedule a time for a "triage specialist" to call me back. After being put on hold for another minute or two, they told me there weren't any times available for a call, so I would have to fill out the online triage form instead. I was on their web site at the time and didn't see anything about a triage form, so I asked where I could find it. The lady repeatedly told me it was on the web site, but when I still couldn't find any kind of form like that, she finally offered to pull up the website herself so she could guide me to it, then after about a minute of continuing to tell me it was on the MIT Medical site under mental health, she told me she couldn't pull it up right now because there were just too many patients in the office to deal with. That ended the call.

So in short, I feel like the one resource here that's supposed to be absolutely concerned with your mental health and wellbeing just told me they don't have time for me.
