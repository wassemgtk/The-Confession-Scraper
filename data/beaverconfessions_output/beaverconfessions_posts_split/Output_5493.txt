Man so like half an hour ago I answered a call and it was a Tech Caller, and initially when they were like "I'm looking for *my mom's name*" I defaulted to "She is speaking" because I was used to that from being told to go call and pay the bills for years, but then after his first few scripted sentences I was like man i have to be honest with you, it's actually me the daughter and no sorry this is a waste of your time we're not going to be donating, and we ended up having a really nice conversation and, here's my point, even during the conversation I was loving his accent and he seemed so sweet and genuine and 90% of me wanted to actually give him my number and ask him out but then 50% of me was saying "dude you've had a few drinks you probably shouldn't" but I'm still regretting that I didn't somehow make it possible to get in touch with him and.... idonno what i'm trying to do here but i guess my confession is that i really, really regret letting this guy slip away so easily. Part of me hopes that he'll comment on this, most of me knows that's not going to happen, all of me wants to make this anguish known to the world because before this I never understood people having those instances where they meet someone and are super into them and then go their separate ways and wish they could get in touch and... this is such a rant but even though i've reread this twenty times i don't want to change anything. I want this guy. For one night at least. Fuck, man. Ugh.
