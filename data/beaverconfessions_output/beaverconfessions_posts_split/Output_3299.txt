usually there are a few songs that i just listen on repeat for like weeks straight

so in the end these songs are destroyed for me

but the nice thing is that my emotional states and memories become associated with them, so if i ever want to think about happier times i can just relisten to a certain song and i'm instantly there it's so nice
