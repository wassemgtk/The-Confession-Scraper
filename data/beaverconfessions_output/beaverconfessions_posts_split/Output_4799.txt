I have a lot of people very upset with me right now, but I don't know why. Every time I think I've realized what I did and try to apologize or make up for it, I turn out wrong. No one will tell me why they're upset. and it's really hard trying to come up with solutions when you don't really know what the problem you should be focusing on is. This is a rhetorical question, but jfc, what am I supposed to do? Even if none of us stay friends, I really don't want to leave things like this...
