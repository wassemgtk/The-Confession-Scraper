I feel like crying everyday now.  006 has been kicking my ass and I can't wrap my head around these algorithms.  I did horribly on the first exam and more horribly on the second.  I feel like if I were to reach out they all would think I never tried hard enough and won't understand me.  Anyways, I just really need to pass the final with flying colors.  The pressure is real. I cry looking at algorithms and I feel like I'll fail the final too :'(
