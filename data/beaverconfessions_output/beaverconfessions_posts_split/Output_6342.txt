I once had a dream where I was sitting in a forest with a girl I was interested in. A werewolf approached us and I knew that if we didn't run away we'd be killed. This girl reached into my pants and started giving me a handjob. At that moment I had to make a decision: tell her to stop so we could escape, or let her continue and face death. I chose the latter. However, after death I was revived to moments before the werewolf attacked us facing the exact same decision. Every time I died I was revived and had to make the same decision over and over again. I forever chose the handjob over survival until I finally woke up.
