I'm looking for a UROP for the summer.  If I don't get one, I'll have to find 2-3 jobs in the city if I want to stay here at MIT.  But right now every single research topic/group that I've pulled up on the department site I'm interested in seems to be WAY over my head.  I've never done research before, and I'm interested in a department that I had zero experience in prior to coming to MIT.  I don't know how the fuck I'm going to get a UROP that excites me and is still doable, and I don't know why anyone would be crazy/daring enough to take me on in their research group.  What am I even doing here?
