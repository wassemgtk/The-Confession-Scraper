I am not sure why only the girls in ring premiere are being slammed. I didn't like their behavior at the event either but there were plenty of absolutely drunk guys who were shouting like the most uncivilized ones and using vulgar words and what not. My ear drums are safe - it's a surprise. I found them very very disturbing too.
