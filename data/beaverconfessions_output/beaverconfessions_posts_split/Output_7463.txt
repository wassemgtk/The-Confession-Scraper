I never know how to respond when people say: "Wow! you must be so smart!" when they find out I go to MIT. I hate hearing that. I'm not even sure if I'm smart or not. I was just an ambitious over-achiever back in high school who was lucky enough to have the opportunity to study here. I'm sure there are lots of smarter kids out there who deserve to be where I am right now.
