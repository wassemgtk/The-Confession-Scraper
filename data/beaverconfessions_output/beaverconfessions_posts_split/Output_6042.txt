I dressed up as an American Indian for Halloween. I was at a Halloween party and everyone was having a good time then some guy came up to me and told me how I was being, "culturally insensitive" and "culturally appropriating" the Indians. I calmly pointed out that Americans have taken pieces of Irish, German, English, Dutch, Italian, Polish, Mexican, and pretty much every other culture out there into a vast melting pot. Imitation is the highest form of flattery. This guy made it clear he did not care for reason and argued his great great grandmother was Cherokee and I was a racist in his eyes. I pointed out that he looked white to me and I doubted the Cherokee would recognize him as one of their own. He then went with the I'm offended and can't keep my mouth shut argument. So then I got nasty, I pointed out that the Cherokees lost to the rest of us, the only ones with honor choose to die fighting, the ones still alive were the cowards who choose to surrender and loose their land and bodies, so he had no pride to take in his Cherokee ancestry. He then stormed away in rage. If you want to start a fight with me over a stupid Halloween costume, prepare to lose.
