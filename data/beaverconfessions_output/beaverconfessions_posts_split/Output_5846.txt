some people are saying that they're sorry about the disappearance of the tunnel goblins - that they were an important part of mit culture - well can i just say i have no sympathy for that attitude! i was once attacked by one of our fucking precious goblins!! i for one am happy that i have the chance to traverse mit's tunnels without fear! much love to the pretty fairies on the east side, though
