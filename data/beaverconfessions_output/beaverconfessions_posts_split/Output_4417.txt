Dear anyone that thinks that #BlackLivesMatter shouldn’t exist and/or is unnecessary,

I am going to be extremely honest about this, some of you anti-BlackLivesMatter people really piss me off. 

The movement exists in order to bring attention to injustices like police brutality and racial profiling that disproportionately impact people of color. It's not saying that your lives matter less, but rather that black lives matter as well. Is that idea racist? Is it racist for me to feel that my life matters too? If you have a problem with that, then you are a part of the actual issue. Sure, "all lives matter" is obvious, but what matters is the action, not the words. People say all lives matter, but most people don't act like they believe all lives matter. Think about how we treat Syrian refugees, Muslims, undocumented immigrants, orphaned children, the homeless, the poor, the sick, the disabled, and many more groups of people in America. We say #BlackLivesMatter because we still live in a country where black lives are treated as if they don't matter. You may think that is an exaggeration, but it is sickening to see how many people support police brutality and how many people still believe that we should ship all black people back to Africa. 

The problem with #AllLivesMatter isn’t the fact that is says all lives matter. It’s because that hashtag came about as a response to #BlackLivesMatter which only served the purpose of trying to illegitimize the original message. 

And don't go on about “Why it doesn't #BlackLivesMatter include everyone?”. No movement can include everyone and people of other marginalized groups have their own movements. 

Frankly, you don’t want to have to need your own movement. A great analogy I like to think of is that these movements are like the fire department and the group they are for is like a house. You don’t call the fire department unless your house is burning, right? And frankly, you don’t ever want to have to call the fire department. So you people that think there needs to be a white lives matter movement, or a straight pride parade, or a men’s rights movement, YOU DON’T HAVE A MOVEMENT BECAUSE YOU DON’T NEED ONE! YOUR “HOUSE” IS NOT ON FIRE!

I have also been reading and hearing a lot of crap about Beyoncé’s halftime performance at the SuperBowl. People claiming that it is racist, anti-police, and that if Black Panther outfits on black female dancers are allowed, then next year, white people should be allowed to dress up in white robes and dance in front of burning crosses. These same people also say that the song Beyoncé sang should be inclusive for everyone. Let me explain everything wrong with that:
1. There is not a line in Beyoncé’s song that is racist or specifically says something bad about white people or the police. If you find one, post it and I’ll take a look. 
2. For the part with the police in the video. Is there anything racist about saying “Stop shooting us”? It’s a fair request and it’s basic human decency. That part of the video is anti-police-brutality, not anti-police. You can be anti-police-brutality and not be anti-police. Those two things are not mutually exclusive. Think of it this way, I’m sure all of you are against medical malpractice. Does that make you anti-doctor? No, and if that does, you have a problem. 
3. The Black Panthers are NOT a black KKK. The KKK were formed as a white supremacy group while the Black Panthers were formed to empower black people and fight against police brutality. I’m not saying that the Black Panthers are completely innocent, I know that they deviated from their original purpose and became violent. But unlike the KKK, they actually started off with good intentions. If you can find me a story of a Black Panther that harassed an innocent white family, burned a cross in front of their house, broke into their home in the middle of the night, dragged the family out of their beds and into the street, whipped the adults in front of their kids, then whipped the kids in front of their parents, and then shot or lynched all of them because of the color of their skin in order to terrorize them into remaining in a subservient role in society and then GOT AWAY WITH ALL OF IT, then you can tell me all about how the Black Panthers and the KKK are the same.
4. Formation is a song meant for black people. Black people are often excluded from pop culture and mainstream media, think #OscarsSoWhite, so why is having a song that celebrates our heritage racist? White people celebrate their heritage every White history Month which runs 12 times a year, every year, and that’s not racist. Black History Month is in February, which is literally the coldest and SHORTEST MONTH OF THE YEAR, so you people that think that there should be a white history month need to get over yourselves. Black History Month is necessary because typically the history of African-Americans and their involvement in the development and growth of this country is reduced to images of slavery and the Civil Rights Movement in low detail. So why does one song that is not for or about white people racist? White people, you don’t HAVE to be included in ABSOLUETELY EVERYTHING. It’s not fair to criticize Beyoncé for performing a song for black people when white artists have never been held to that same standard. Black people aren’t complaining about not being involved in everything, we are upset about being represented in almost nothing especially when the most common representations of black people in movies, TV, books, etc., usually are the maid/housekeeper, the sassy black nurse, the fat sassy black lady, the old black janitor, slaves, adulterers, baby mamas or baby daddys, or the characters from The Boondocks. We are just stage props in these things for the most part.
Sure, BLM is not the perfect social movement. If you can find me one, then I will be really impressed and you can ignore everything I said. But, it’s still necessary. You can’t possibly expect that nearly 400 years of slavery, Jim Crow Laws, poll taxes, grandfather clauses, literacy tests, oppression, sharecropping, segregation, discrimination, and racism can disappear within a few decades with the passing of a few laws. Most nations that have been around for centuries to millennia longer than the existence of the United States are still shaped by the ills of their past history, so how can you expect that America is any better? We are a great nation but we are NOT the greatest country in the world, we are not above other people simply because we are American, especially with how we treat our own people, especially people of color. We can do better than this. This nation has done amazing things. We have reached for the stars and landed on the moon, cured diseases, made peace between warring lands, and feed and clothed billions. If we can do those things as a nation, we can at least make things better for the people that live here and call this place home.
