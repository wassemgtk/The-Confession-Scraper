i have a strange feeling that i've been blackout drunk more times than i can remember. it feels very strange to know there are specific events that you just cannot remember. The more I try, the more pointedly these lapses of memory appear as gaping holes in my past. I don't even know how to go about asking anyone who might be able to shed some light on these moments what they can recall, because they often feel like clippings from dreams rather than from reality. Like, "Hey, do you remember what I said when we ran into each other in the kitchen the night of that party 3 weeks ago? I think whatever it was either made you laugh or made you upset, or maybe one and then the other? ... Oh, No? You don't remember either? Huh... well..."
