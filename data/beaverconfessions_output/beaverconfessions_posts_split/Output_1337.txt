I have a super unhealthy relationship with food and would love someone to talk to about it. I'm not comfortable talking to my therapist about it yet. Email me at bad-at-eating@mit.edu to get in touch?

I'm about five pounds overweight, and I can't stop obsessing over that number. I look in the mirror and see a fat blob. I would like to lose fat. I try and eat about 1000 calories a day, and usually freak out if I go over that number. The problem is, after about a week of great willpower, I binge and eat a ton of junk food. Usually this only brings me to maintenance at ~2000 calories, but I always feel terrible about it. 

I've lost a few pounds already and that made me really happy, but I feel like I'm not going about this in a healthy way. There's no way 1000 calories is a healthy number. Does anyone else have experience dealing with this sort of thing? How did you stop obsessing over calories and punishing yourself when you messed up? Will it end when I reach my goal weight? I'm just lost. :/
