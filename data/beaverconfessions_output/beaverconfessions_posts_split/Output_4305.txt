Goddamn it, it makes me so frustrated and feels like shit when I ask my friends for help and they ignore my pleas or tell me to google it. I know how to google shit, and I've probably already tried, if I got it I wouldn't be asking. Is an explanation or some guidance too much to ask for? I get the vibe that it's almost as though they feel that I'm undeserving of the points because they got it on their own, without any help. I never feel more lonely than I do when I'm doing my psets...
