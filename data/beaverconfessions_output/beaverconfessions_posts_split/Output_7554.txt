can't stand hearing people talking about how "dumb" other MIT students are. Especially as freshmen, when probably 90% of your scores and apparent strengths are based on high school preparation. Obviously if you already took a college class covering the same material as one of the GIRs you'll have it easier than your classmates. But if you actually were such a genius, you would have passed the ASE. So shut up and realize that you were incredibly lucky to have had a better high school education than 99% of the world, instead of putting everyone else down.
