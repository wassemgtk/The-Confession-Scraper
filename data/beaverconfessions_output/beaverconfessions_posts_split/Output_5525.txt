I entered my first relationship my freshman year. It was verbally and physically abusive and lacked consent. He kept braking up with me and then we would get back together. He told me to stop crying all the time, and that if I went to get help or went on meds he would break up with me. We finally broke up my sophomore year, and the summer afterwards I was raped by someone else. I blame the guy in my first relationship for everything bad that's happened to me, and truly wish that he would suffer or die. I feel guilty for feeling that way.

Today, I'm on a lot of meds and go to a lot of therapy. I'm in a long-term, non-abusive relationship. I'll graduate soon and be out of this terrible place.

It all sucks, but it gets better.
