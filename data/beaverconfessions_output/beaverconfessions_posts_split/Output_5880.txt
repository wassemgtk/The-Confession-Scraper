I'm kind of confused by the whole debate going on about the black dude that's upset people won't dance with him. People are arguing that it's racist if someone doesn't want to dance with him because he's black. It isn't racist if you aren't generally attracted to a particular race. There's not really a whole lot you can do about sexual attraction. I generally don't find white guys attractive, but that's not to say there are no attractive white guys. Sure, it's racist to say "white men aren't attractive," but it's not racist to say that statistically, I'm not as likely to be attracted to a white male. Equality is important but people are still going to have preferences and differences despite being on equal ground with one another.
