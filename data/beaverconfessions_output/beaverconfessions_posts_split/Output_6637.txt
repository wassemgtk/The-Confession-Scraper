To the weirdo guy who posted that he is "frightened" by what girls here do with boys. What is your problem? Why are you so cut up about it? I think it's awesome! If a girl wants to do "Caligula style acts" good for her. In fact I think I'll be joining. If a women wants to take more loads then a 25 cent washing machine that's none of your business. Why don't you worry about your own problems, like the fact that you are upset that nobody wants to give you the shocker while giving you head.
