What many people don't know is that socialist societies have actually existed for a very long time. For example, the Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt was actually an early socialist state. How so, you ask, despite the proletariat not even coming into being until centuries and centuries later? Because it had the Library of Alexandria, and as we all know, public libraries are inherently socialist. Unfortunately, the Library was burned down by Julius Caesar, and the Kingdom itself was later annexed by the Romans. But all was not lost. For the Roman Empire was socialist as well! Yes, it was an absolute monarchy whose economy was literally powered by slaves, but it also possessed a system of public roads. Public roads, as we know, are a prime example of democratic socialism. Now, there are some deluded people out there who believe that socialism is actually something about "social ownership of the means of production," whatever the hell that means. But don't worry! These revisionist fools shall be hunted down by our socialist police forces and socialist US military, so that true socialism can be protected!

Public services of the world, unite!
