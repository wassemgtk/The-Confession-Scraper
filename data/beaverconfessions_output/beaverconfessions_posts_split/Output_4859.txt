How do you tell you're in love with someone? I'm not sure if I'm there yet, or if I will ever be in my life, but I do love him, like if anything bad happened I would drop everything to come help, I would want to be there to help celebrate anything, and remind him every chance I get how awesome and valuable a person he is. I'm also scared of saying that I love him because I don't want him to feel like he has to say it back, especially if he doesn't feel that way. I just want him to know that I'm there for him no matter what.
