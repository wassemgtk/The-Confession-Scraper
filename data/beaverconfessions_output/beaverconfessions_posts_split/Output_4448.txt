Well, I was having a great Monday, thanks for asking. Right up until the moment where you decided to shit on me for absolutely no reason at all when I wasn't even talking to you. It was extremely rude to say what you said, especially given the fact that no one in our circle of friends has ever deferred to me, not even once, to hear my *****. Fuck you for thinking you are hot shit; you know nothing (basic-bitch version of) Jon Snow.
