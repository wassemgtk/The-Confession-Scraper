Um help, I won't go any farther in life if I don't get a hold of how sloppy and half assed I am. Can anyone recommend a method that they have used to reform logicking and writing? I'm seriously riding off of intuition 90% of the time, but if I just followed a process step to step it would be better.
I beg of you, anyone, I need tested methods and solid regiments. I already see 2 experts for ADHD, but they haven't lived it so they don't really have recommendations.
