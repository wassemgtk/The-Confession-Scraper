You only ever talk to me when you need something from me. I knew this from the very beginning but I wanted to get to know you better so I did my best to help. But really? Is it so hard to keep a conversation with me? Even when I'm in the middle of helping you, you vanish on me. Seriously reconsidering this relationship
