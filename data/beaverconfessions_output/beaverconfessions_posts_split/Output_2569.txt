Trevor McMichael is the nicest guy I know. He genuinely meant no harm by his post, and once he got called out for the caption he was absolutely devastated and is trying his absolute hardest to remedy the situation. People need to give him a break because he really is trying his best to represent the class and gain back respect from every person who was offended.
