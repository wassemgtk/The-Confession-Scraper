I really feel like I understand MIT and belong there and that is why I come to this page and obsess over how it feels to be there. I hate you guys sometimes because I get jealous but then love you because it feels I can really have amazing friendships with you. I know this sounds sad, desperate and creepy but I don't fucking care haha
