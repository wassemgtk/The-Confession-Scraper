I feel stuck and trapped in my old friend group, and I don't know how to make new friends. It may be too late for me. It's not that I dislike my friends, but I don't feel especially close to them. There's so much pressure to make your best, longest lasting friends here, but there's almost no one I feel really close too. I'm worried that I'll graduate with no close friends then go into the real world where it's even harder to meet people and be even more alone. :(
