This question may sound bad but please hear me out, I mean this in the least judgmental way possible: Why do Asians feel like they're underrepresented here? Asian Americans represent about 5% of the US population but at MIT represent about 30% of the student population. Meanwhile US population vs MIT population for other races respectively is about 12% to 10%(even though many black students will say that is number is more realistically 5-6%) for Black students, 16% to 14% for Hispanic/Latino students, and 63% to 51% for White/Caucasian students. (I'm not including the numbers for international students, undocumented people, or other smaller or foreign groups because the numbers on specific groups are a bit fuzzy.) But according to these numbers, how do you feel underrepresented? Again, this is out of pure curiosity. I do not mean this in any judgmental or possibly racist way. I just overheard a few Asian pre-frosh talking about discrimination in admissions processes and feeling underrepresented at a school like MIT and I just want to understand your perspective better.
