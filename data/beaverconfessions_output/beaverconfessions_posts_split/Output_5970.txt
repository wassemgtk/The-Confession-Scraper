I've had many bad friendships, and I'm trying to start over but I've lost all hope I had in me and other people. I can't make friends anymore, and all the time spent alone (amongst other things) is giving me suicidal thoughts. I made some changes, and I had such high hopes that everything would work out this year but it all came crashing down. For the first time in 3 years, I cant muster up any hope for the future. What do I do now?
