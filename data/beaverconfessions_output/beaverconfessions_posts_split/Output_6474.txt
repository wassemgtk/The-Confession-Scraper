Last semester I had crippling depression and anxiety. I cried anytime I was in class, and I cried at night on the days I did skip class. I almost cut myself a few times, but in one of my saner moments I gave my knife away. I talked to a few of my friends about it, but I feel so bad for all my other friends that I lied to. All of the "stomachaches" and "colds" I made up when they ask me if I had gone to class. I want to tell them so badly, to apologize; but I just can't. I'm so afraid of what they would think of me, eve though I know what what they would say, that it wasn't my fault and they don't blame me. I do though, I blame myself. I'm guilty.
