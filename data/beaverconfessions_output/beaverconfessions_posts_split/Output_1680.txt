To the girl who asked if I was okay Tuesday night in front of Kresge, Thank you :) your kindness made me feel a lot better. Thanks for saying "I'm glad" when I said I was okay. I was feeling fairly shitty and actually was just wondering if anyone would be sad if I were gone, but then I thought, "hey, she's glad that I'm okay." Wish you the best of luck for the next few weeks :)
