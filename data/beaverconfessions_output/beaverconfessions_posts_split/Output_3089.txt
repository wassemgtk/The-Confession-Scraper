How do I get to know someone I'm hopelessly in love with from afar? Someone who is but a star in the sky, a diamond in the rocks, whose one look can make me forget the world? And yet, you barely know I exist. How do I get close to you when we only have one class together and not many mutual friends? Fuck, talking to guys is hard. I just want you to know how beautiful you are
