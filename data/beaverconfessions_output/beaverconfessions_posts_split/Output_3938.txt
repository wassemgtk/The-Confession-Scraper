Well, I guess my social experiment has come to an end. I don't expect you to post this confession, though I certainly hope you do. I am Jane Rathbone. Of course, that is not my real name, but I am a real student at MIT. 

I created the account to see what would happen if someone were to espouse conservative views on nearly every liberal post, as I see happen so much on conservative posts with "Daryl & co." As I expected, the response was extremely negative, although I must say I was underwhelmed by the lack of strong arguments to refute my points. I challenged people many times to point out anything explicitly racist which I had said. I never received a response. I was called out several times, and when faced with respectable arguments, I argued back in a similarly logical manner. 

The result of this experiment is censorship of the MIT confessions page. I had been expecting this, but somehow it was still a surprise that the page admins could be so blatantly hypocritical. If you are unwilling to bear the opinions of the other side, I guess I just say to you: enjoy your echo chamber. To all of the campus conservatives, alt-righters, shitposters, nationalists, redpillers, et al (because i KNOW you're out there), I simply say never give up. The not-so-fierce opposition we face will inevitably self destruct. And meanwhile we must keep spreading the truth, no matter who attempts to censor it. The tides are changing my friends.
