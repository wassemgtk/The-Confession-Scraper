So I just read that the US may start forcing women to register for the draft and I think that's fucked up on many levels. The idea is that if women want the same rights as men then we should serve along side men. And I realize that the draft is rarely used but this is isn't even about equal rights and using that as the reason behind this is fucked up. If it was really about equality, then the military officials deciding this and pushing for this bill should not be mostly men. And frankly if the military can't even ensure the safety of women in combat now, specifically when it comes to sexual assault, what do you think is going to happen if women are forced to be there? 

I am personally very anti-war and think no one should have to register for the draft regardless of sex. But if this is really going to be about equality, then I want the same men that think it is right to send women off to kill others and/or die to give me and other women the rights we actually deserve. Rights like full access to birth control, feminine products (without a pink tax), equal pay, and the right to decide what to do with my own body without the influence of government.

I get that a lot of people may agree with this bill and I'm not "anti-America" for disagreeing with it. I just think it's wrong to use women's rights and equality as an excuse to force people to serve the military, especially when the military is not the only (or often even the best way) to serve your country. These men don't actually care about women's rights. If they did they would have done more about sexual assault in the military and other women's rights issues in the US.

I'm just irritated now. It's late, I'm tired, and what I read just made me really angry so I probably did not develop my points as well as I should have or even used the most proper and/or accurate terms, so I guess you can say this was more of an angry rant. I'll do more research on this later but I just wanted to blow off some steam right now.
