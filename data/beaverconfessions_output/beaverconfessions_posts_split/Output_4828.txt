As a Bernie Sanders supporter I think we need to address a thorny issue about the election. Although he's doing great and I hope he gets the nomination there's still a good chance it will be Hilary. A few die hards say Bernie or nobody. I want to push against that for a pragmatic reason, Obama. He's a great president, he's also done a great job of expanding presidential power. He's established the presidential ability to put in carbon regulations, net neutrality, not enforce laws on immigration and marijuana to give more people freedom, negotiate the climate deal in Paris, prevent federal contractors from LBGT discrimination, and use drones to fight terror, all without the need for congress or courts. This is great stuff, only there's one catch. Now if a Republican gets elected they can undue every single one of these accomplishments in a second, and there's more. A republican president could also order federal contractors to discriminate against LBGT people, set up the INS to deport millions, not enforce clean water and air laws letting polluters go free, etc, etc. By making the president more powerful, we set up a Republican to do catastrophic damage. Although we've gained much under Obama, more is now at risk then ever. If Bernie doesn't get the nomination we have to rally around Clinton, not for us, but for those without a voice.
