I'm so ashamed of myself but I have a huge crush on Chris Columbo. I catch glimpses of him in the Infinite sometimes and I get butterflies. Every time I hear people saying that they don't like him or that they're glad he's stepping down, I feel this mixture of anger and embarrassment. I just want this to go away. Please tell me that someone else feels like this.
