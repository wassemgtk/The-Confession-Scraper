I realize that TAs have lots of students, but after recently becoming a TA and realizing that memorizing names is really not that difficult, I have to get this off my chest. I’m pretty bothered by the fact that every time my TAs hand things back, they always have to ask what my name is, and I’m pretty sure it’s because I’m Asian. Today when I was getting a math pset back, my TA knew the names of everyone in the class except the Asians. This has happened more than once, and I feel like by now, he’d know all of our names. I’m not just targeting him; I’m saying in most cases, white TAs never know Asian students’ names. Granted, I’ve had one white TA who knew my name, but for the large majority, I’ve always had to tell them my name.
I know that people usually have an easier time recognizing people of their own race, but seriously – learn the students’ names! I feel so awkward whenever they hand things out because they’ll hand back my friends’ papers with no trouble at all, but when they get to me, they’ll say, “Sorry, what’s your name again?” It’s like – bruh, I’ve been at every single recitation, and I actually participate/answer your questions. This is the 5th time you’ve asked. Idk if there’s anything to do about it; just had to get this off my chest. It makes me really grateful for the TAs who memorize everyone’s name after the first week, but it also makes me sad because I feel like I’m not memorable at all – just another Asian at MIT.
