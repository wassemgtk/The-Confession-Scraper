i didn't have many friends until mit, and maybe because of this, i always become way too invested in my friendships. i feel like i always give more to a close friendship than i get, and i fucking hate myself sometimes for being so clingy and needy. the more interactions i initiate, the more i get worried that this person will get annoyed with me and distance themselves (and i'm pretty sure it's happened before).
