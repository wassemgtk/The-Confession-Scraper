Sure, a girl who isn't so "tumblr feely" sounds nice, but when you get down to it, most ENTJ's have pretty poor relationships given their difficulty expressing emotion, especially when expressing said emotion is at some sort of risk (as is always the case in relationships). We're much happier being lone wolves  ;)
