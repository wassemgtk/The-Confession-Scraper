My Ayida story: During my freshman spring I was raped. Although I had done relatively well the semester before, I kept having flashbacks and could not sleep which resulted in me not doing well in my classes. I kept falling behind in my work and went to S^3. I met with Ayida, and I explained to her my situation. She proceeded to tell me that the rape should not be taking that much of a toll on my schoolwork and that if I couldn't handle the GIRs then I didn't belong at MIT. She obviously refused to advcoate for extensions in my classes. I failed most of my classes that semester and was put on academic probation. It took me that semester and the following summer to pick myself back up. I still have flashbacks and I still have problems sleeping. I never returned to S^3 for anything. I've learned that for all the fake support MIT claims to offer the truth of the matter is, MIT will only help you if there is a possibility you can sue them. It is now my senior year and I have been accepted into my dream graduate school. Fuck you, Ayida. I do belong here, YOU DON'T.
