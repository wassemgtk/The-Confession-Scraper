Many of us have been affected by the suicide of a classmate, friend, family member, or another loved one. Through this experience, we have felt grief, anguish, confusion, anger, guilt, and a plethora of other emotions. This Tuesday we invite MIT to gather as a community for a discussion and film about hope, help, suicide, and suicide survivors (those affected by the suicide of a loved one).
Tuesday 4/5 7:15pm - 9pm 10-250. Dinner served.
