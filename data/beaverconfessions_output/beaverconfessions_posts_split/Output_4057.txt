I disagree with black lives matter. Michael Brown got himself killed. If you don't try to fight cops or point what looks like a real gun at them then you wont get killed! It really isn't that difficult. Black on Black murder, and Black on White murder,  is way higher than White on Black murder. And why can't they get over slavery. Thats was 150 years ago, we all agreed it was wrong, lets move on. There is a reason that black people get arrested more, it's because they commit more crimes!. Black communities need to start being accountable for themselves.
