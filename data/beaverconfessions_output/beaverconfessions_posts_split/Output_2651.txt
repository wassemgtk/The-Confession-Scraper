So I’ve been in a relationship for a long time now with my girlfriend and I love her very much. I met another girl who also has a boyfriend who she loves very much and has been with for a long time. I find her very attractive and she finds me attractive too. We’ve become good friends and I notice we act different when we’re with each other. It’s kind of refreshing. We both wish we could’ve met each other before our respective significant others. And we’re not willing to let go of our significant others because there lies uncertainty between us that has been resolved in our current respective relationships. That, and there’s a bit of a sunk cost too. We’re both kinda keeping in touch with each other in case things don’t work out with our respective partners, kinda like networking, but for relationships. We’re both each other’s love backups I guess, but we don’t dare act on impulses because that would be disloyal to our respective partners or even explicitly mention that we’re each others backups.

Is that weird? The whole love-backup, love-networking, sunk-cost, no-acting-on-impulse thing?
