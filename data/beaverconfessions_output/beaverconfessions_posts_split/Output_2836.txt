I actually think dildo.io is a really cool idea for those people that are DTF, but as someone that is not as DTF and is looking for something more emotional, I think that having some kind of way to find out who is willing to date and maybe some kind of blurb about what people are looking for would be helpful.  I've been rejected every time I have tried to get to know someone romantically at this school so far.  Neither claimed to be interested in any sort of romantic pursuit, and whether or not they were being genuine I do think there are people that are not looking for anything and it would be helpful to distinguish so that I can avoid just chasing pavements when they lead nowhere
