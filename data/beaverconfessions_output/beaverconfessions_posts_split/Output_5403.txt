I love waking up to the sound of jackhammers outside my window! After coming back from break, I was worried about sleeping through my morning alarm. However, no need to fear, the jackhammers started almost 2 hours before my previously scheduled alarm, giving me plenty of time to wake up! I'm also a pretty heavy sleeper; I've slept through earthquakes, fire alarms, and so on. But the jackhammering was loud and incessant enough that it woke me up almost instantly! Lastly, since it's pretty cold outside right now, I didn't want to open my window at all. But even with my window completely closed, the sound was hardly muffled! What a time to be alive!
