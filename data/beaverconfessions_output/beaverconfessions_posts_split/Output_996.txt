In public, I am forced to adopt the narrative. In the company of friends, I have to pretend that I drank the kool-aid. But only in private or in anon can I say that regressive liberals are an anti-white hate group."Diversity" equals not white. Crying "privilege! is just their way of justifying the silencing of contrasting viewpoints. Everything I say is just "whitesplaining" or "mansplaining" but they really mean "not oppressed enough to hang." Why am I guilty for the actions done by people with my same skin tone hundreds of years ago? Every (former) friend of mine hates themselves just for being a fucking white male! I hate what our generation has become.
