Okay. Let's settle this once and for all. Goku can see past illusions by focusing his ki. That's also how he can sense his enemies without sight (or any other sensory apparatus). The only limiting factor to this almost universal perception is his body's reaction time. In fact, if we are getting technical here, I'd like to say that Genjutsu works by scrambling a person's chakra flow. Goku, being from a different universe, has no chakra network. Even if we allow for all humans in all universes to have an obscure chakra network as a tertiary circulatory system, Goku is no human. He is a Saiyan. 
Beat this, bitches.
