Was studying for 6.006 in the Green lounge in the infinite. I found myself drowsy.

I set a 1hr timer on my phone and laid down on the sofas like a rebel.

I dreamt (I wrote dreampt first, but my browser autocorrected it) I was on a long trip far from home, walking through the airport toward the gate where my flight was to depart from. And I hadn't called my parents in weeks. I was a bad son.

I open the door to my departure gate and step through it. I immediately pitch over sideways and my carry-on goes flying, so that I land flat on my back with its strap around my neck. Imagine the very long flight of stairs leading up from the Harvard T stop to the street. Now imagine if those stairs were carpeted, and there were no stairs, just a long, carpeted ramp inclined at a sharp angle, but about the same height. That is what I had just walked out onto, causing me to pitch sideways.

The incline was so steep. Only the static friction of the carpeting prevented me from sliding all the way down to the bottom, which was too far below to even see. I could not get up for fear of falling again and sliding all the way down this time. My carry-on wanted to slide down the stairs and its strap was pulling around my neck. 

I should have called my parents more.

Other people around me seemed to be walking up the incline just fine, but there I was lying on the carpeting, staring at the ceiling. I tried to call out for someone to help me get up. "Excuse me!" I tried to shout. But when I tried to speak, my mouth just sputtered and my eyelids quivered. I kept trying to say, then shout "Excuse me! Excuse me! EXCUSE MEEEEEEEEE" but my mouth couldn't do words...

"EXCUSE MEEEEEEEEE!" I gasped as I woke with a start in the Green room. A quick glance around confirmed that everyone was studiously avoiding eye contact with the crazy person who was talking to himself. But hey, I woke up with 7min left on the timer. 

Time to go fail 6.006.
