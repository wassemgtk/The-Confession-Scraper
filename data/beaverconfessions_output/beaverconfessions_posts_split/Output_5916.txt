2529 here.

Nope I am not creepy because like I already said, I get to dance with open minded girls at the same parties. You probably need more context: many of the girls I have observed decline dancing with black dudes every freaking time. it absolutely is about race. Is that sad? yes! Should it change? Absolutely.

At the end of  the day, people of any 'racial group' [in the US] attribute so much to the bullshit they read in the media about people of other races.  This is very different from my experience when I was based in Germany, where most people I met were actually curious about who I was than how closely related I were to some bullshit stat they read about those who looked like me on a tabloid.

What I am saying is that I have had to prove to lame grils here that I wasn't a 'thug' before they would actually dance with me, Now, that's bullshit.
