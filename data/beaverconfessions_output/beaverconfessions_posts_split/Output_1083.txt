I wish people on this campus would understand that admittance to frat parties is a privilege, not a right. Yes, even if you're a girl and think you're hot.

Like, no, it's not OK to give me shit at the door (or around campus!!) because I denied you entrance to my private residence after we reached capacity. Please appreciate that the reason we stop letting people in is a fucking matter of safety, not because we don't like you.

I'm genuinely sorry that you happened to be the person that would have put us over capacity, but srsly, in case of a fire, we need to be able to get everyone outside asap, we just can't do that if we let too many people in and we have to cut off somewhere.
