I just discovered that my roommate does not wash his hands after going to the bathroom. I definitely think this is something worth talking to him about. However, he also has never cleaned our room, never cleaned the bathroom (and leaves trash all over it, even though it is tiny and has a trash can), rarely showers or does laundry and thus often smells very bad, and leaves horrible smelling towels in our room and bathroom. All of these things annoy me, but since he never complains about anything I do (except sometimes opening the windows when he is particularly bad smelling), I don't want to be obnoxious or confrontational and have to talk to him about all of those things. Should I? Can I (does he have the right to not wash his hands or leave stinky towels lying around)? Do I have to pick 2? Please help.
