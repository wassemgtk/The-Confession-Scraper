My penis is really really fucking bent and it really gets me down. I think sex will be basically impossible, and it's something I can't really talk to anyone about.

things to be thankful for in life
=================
1. I go to mit
2. I will make a fuckton of money
3. I have friends
4. My parents are alive and cool
5. I have two working eyes
6. Two working ears
7. I do not have a rare disease that makes my skin disintegrate when i touch anything
8. I have $20 in my pocket
9. I have not been sentenced to 15 years hard labor in north korea
10. I will never have to give childbirth
11. Cops don't want to shoot me
12. Huge biceps
13. I am not failing any classes
14. I have an internship
15. I can afford to see movies and go to restaurants

BUT WHY?!?!? I would give up 1, 2, and 3 for a normal dick. I want to punch a brick wall until my hand is a mess of sinews and bone fragments. Morning, noon and night I think about the fact that I will never plunge my hard dick into a warm wet vagina. Or maybe I can somehow be suspended from the ceiling and in the best case it will be really awkward and painful for both of us. Whenever I see a guy I think about how their dick is probably normal and I want to punch them in the face.

16. I am not dying of starvation
17. I am not living in the middle ages and tied to a wheel and being beaten to a pulp and eviscerated and burned alive
18. I do not live in ISIS
19. My eyeballs are not being gouged out
20. Molten silver is not being poured down my ears and throat
21. I do not have ebola
22. I have four working limbs
23. I can hold a marble with my dick
