OK, I don’t go to MIT but I’m drunk and I feel like having an anonymous confession somewhere other than church. I don’t have any desire to suffer, neither in reality or in retrospect. I’m going to say it. Falling in love sucks, falling out of love sucks harder. I felt like I was going crazy two years ago because a guy I knew had no idea I existed. It’s been two years since we’ve last spoken and I’m still hung up over how immaculate he is. He was so good at everything, like wtf. His fashion sense was SO fucking stellar omg. Like it was so on point he literally dressed better than every gay guy at our high school. I’m gay and before the social justice warriors attack... dressing nice is a positive stereotype we should all own up to! Anyway he goes here and has a girlfriend… he’s probably also heterosexual… I’m praying one day he’ll leave her and marry me. Omg that sounds so mean but I love him. I also hope I won’t act like a fuck up around him. Like seriously every chance I had to talk to him I spazzed the shit out. Ugh. If I ever see him again I’ll do something other than talk about trashy pop music and compliment his fucking socks. What the hell is wrong with me?
