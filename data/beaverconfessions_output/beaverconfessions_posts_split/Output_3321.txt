I always feel bad when Muslim women catch me staring at them because from all the Islamophobia that has been going on lately, I guess they think I am judging them. 

But I just want to say that I don't judge you for wearing a hijab and not all non-Muslims are assholes about it. 

I don't mean to stare, but I really love your hijabs. They are soooo pretty. 

I really admire how you ladies manage to match so many different intricate patterns into a cohesive outfit and the different ways you tie or pin them. I can barely match stripes to jeans. 

You ladies are fabulous and people that say otherwise are assholes. 

Stay fabulous.
