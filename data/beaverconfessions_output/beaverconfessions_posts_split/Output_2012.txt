If I could turn back time for a month I would. I fucked up big time on my classes, and I'm feeling super paralyzed with fear right now. I'm just hoping and praying that I make it through this semester with minimal damage to my GPA, but as a second semester junior, no matter what I'm feeling kind of screwed. 

Fuck my life.
