I’ve been using a Visa gift card recently to buy everyday stuff because I’m starting to go broke and I have like 10 of them in a drawer. And I ran out of balance the other day at McDonald’s which is cool. It took off like a dollar from my balance and I cleared the rest with my credit card.

Then I accidentally used it at Dunkin the same day and it worked, no problem. I tried my luck at Verde’s and no problem. I called to check my balance on the gift card and I have no money left. I’ve been using it at Verde’s for the last 3 days and every now and then it won’t work and I use another card but if I go to the right cashiers they don’t give a fuck. They get this confused look, push some buttons frantically, and tell me to have a good day. 

The worst thing is I ain’t feel bad because you know, fuck Verde’s and their overpriced shit. I wonder when my luck will run out.
