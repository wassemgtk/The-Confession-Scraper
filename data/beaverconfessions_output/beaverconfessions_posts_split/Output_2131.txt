I'm one of the defectors who transferred schools after my freshman year so I actually don't go to MIT anymore and all of my MIT friends stopped talking to me shortly after I left including those who used to be my "best friends" for that year. Sometimes when I post something here and it gets many likes from said "friends", and people I once called my besties start tagging more fake friends, I just can't help but feel victorious...it's pretty pathetic but I somehow feel validated when these people still relate to me even when they avoid all my attempts to reach out.
