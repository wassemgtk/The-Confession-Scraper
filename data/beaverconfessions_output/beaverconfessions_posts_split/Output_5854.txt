A good friend of mine and I do something that would shock most people. But I want to explain why. I'm white, he's black. We like to joke with race amongst each other. For example, he'll joke, "oh look this white man can dance, his mother must have been real n***** lover". And I'll joke with him saying things such as, "A n***** with intellect? Some of those slave owners must have been sneaking into cabins looking for some brown sugar". We both laugh and find this funny. The reason is it's a sign of our friendship. We can say the absolute cruelest things to each other and laugh it off as a joke because we know we mean nothing by it. It also helps strengthen our ability to remain calm and take insults from others if needed. We don't do this in front of other people for obvious reasons.
