Who the fuck is blasting all this loud shitty music over Briggs field?! Just because it's Sunday, does not mean people don't have shit to do! I don't care if you want to have music at whatever event you're having but I shouldn't be able to hear you from New House even though my windows are closed! This is fucking ridiculous!
