MIT has 10/10 mental health services. It's funny how friends tell me that MIT has 'a lot of services' concerning depression when in reality it's all a lame excuse to cover up the high suicide rate. It took a lot of wasted willpower to go to MIT Medic to just encounter this mediocre secretary who's paid too little to even give me a smile. Im told I need to wait for a call to set up an appointment for who knows when. I mean what do I need to do to get their attention? Aren't they supposed to be the ones to help me? I guess I'm not that important here. MIT itself is getting a warehouse full of disposable students if you haven't heard.
