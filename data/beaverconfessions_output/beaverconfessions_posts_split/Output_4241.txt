I really don’t get what’s happening in my damn mind but it’s hurting me. Really want to cry. One thing that makes me cry is my age. I think that 22 is too old to start being what I’ve pictured in my head. Actually, I’m not satisfied with whatever I’m doing. Sigh … Living is hurting me. If I had choice, I would die. Nothing is interesting. Seems I don’t progress at all. Never been successful. Have written lots of TODO list but I’ve done nothing. Why? I’m just wasting my time. As a student, I would like to progress in the field I’m working on but nothing. Some peeps are really successful. It’s hard to be me. I’m constantly thinking that 22 is too old. I’ve failed at whatever I done. I’ve wasted my time specially when I was an undergraduate student. I took the courses and pass all of them but I believe that I could spend much more time on them. I love mathematics but I’ve never dedicated a greate amount of time to it. Beside these, I feel old.Think that I’m behind of my peers. Internet people. What do you think? I really do not know what to do. Is 22 old? Is it a failure?
