I have had the biggest crush on one of my best friends here since early last semester and every time we get close I am reminded of what a horrible person I am. I appreciate their head, they make me feel sane for once, like I could be sober for more than an hour for once for them but I always push them away and some day they may give up on me as a friend altogether. I don't deserve any kindness and they continue to give and give and I continue to never be good enough, like I cant even write a sober confession
