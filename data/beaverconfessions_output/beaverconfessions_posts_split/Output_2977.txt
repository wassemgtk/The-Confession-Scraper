Keeping a cool head and high grades during dry spells is important. The secret is to only allow yourself to masturbate when you get an A on your midterms. This practice: 1) prevents sexual frustration 2) keeps your grades up (5.0 GPA for me), 3) temporally distributes your sessions to prevent chronic fapping, 4) spikes your test levels every week, thereby increasing your weekend gains. This is all confirmed by science and psychology. Voluntary celibacy is the truest form of discipline. Once you exploit your reward-seeking behavior to do things that actually matter, everything falls into place and you cease to disappoint yourself. I am the master of my habits. I am the captain of my dick.
