Though I didn't personally know Phoebe Wang, my UROP over the summer did. For the first time today I suddenly realized how terrifying it must be to hear about the death of someone who you knew, even if you didn't know them well. A haunting feeling...a young, vibrant life, suddenly gone. All the hope she carried suddenly gone...this must make MIT all the more scarier for others. I hope that these deaths at MIT end...the realization that what happens in your life has an impact on several others is very important.
