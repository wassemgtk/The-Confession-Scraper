I walk around naked in my room a lot.  When I need to pee, I don't feel like putting on clothes so I pee into things in my room.  I had a cup in my room that kept on filling up with pee for ages.  I stopped peeing in cups and threw out all of my cups.  I thought it was a bad habit to get into.  I didn't want people coming into my room and seeing and smelling my pee-filled cups.
I threw away the cups.  But habits are hard to break.  Now I pee in my trash.  But I only take out the trash once a week.  Now my room smells so badly of old pee and I am too embarrassed to take out the trash in case someone smells my trash bag (it smells REALLY bad).
I am waiting until 4 am to take out my trash.
I wish this was a joke but everything I wrote here is true.  My room stinks so badly.  I am going to buy cups again.  Until I can break my habit.
For the record, I am female and have awesome aim.  AMAZING AIM.
