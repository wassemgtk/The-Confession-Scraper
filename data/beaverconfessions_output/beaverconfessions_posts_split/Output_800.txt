Two days ago I realized that while I'm decently attractive I can't let myself think that. After being sexually assaulted multiple times, the only thought that keeps me sane is to believe that I'm not attractive AT ALL. I don't have any problems with my body but I have a problem with what the world sees my body to be. Is that all I am? A vessel to be used and thrown away?
