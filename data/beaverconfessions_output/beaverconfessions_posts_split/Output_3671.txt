I like to call both my friends and enemies "bae", not entirely because it means "best friend" but because there is a chance (possibly untrue, but irrelevant because this is so widely believed) that it's the Danish word for poop. It's a good way to mess with people's minds because they have no idea what exactly you're calling them.
