There is this Berklee girl I can't get my mind off. We almost hooked up once, but she didn't want to cheat on her boyfriend, so she told me that she doesn't want to see me again. Now I can't study for my 18.02 test because I just can't stop thinking about what could have been if she didn't have a boyfriend :(
