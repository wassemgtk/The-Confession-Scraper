I think I have a pre-midlife crisis since I obviously have so much free time now. I have all these questions in mind, like what do I want to do with my life, my career, and etc. Will I get a good job if I have a so-so GPA? Part of me wants to go to grad school to study whatever I truly enjoy (still haven't realized what I really like for sure ...yet) but the other part doubts whether I'll be cut out for grad school. For some reason, people would think I look sick with worries when I bring these questions up in person.
