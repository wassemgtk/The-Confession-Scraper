Before I knew your name, all I could think was how could I possibly meet you
Seeing you from across the room is how the toughest of classes I got through 

When we began to talk it felt like you were everything I wanted and more 
But in the blink of an eye, I ruined it as my dreams smashed to the floor

Now I long for summer so that I can let my heart finally be at ease 
Because seeing you now still gives me the tremble in my knees

Losing you makes my heart break knowing that my shot is done 
The summation of our checks on dildo.io will forever be just one
