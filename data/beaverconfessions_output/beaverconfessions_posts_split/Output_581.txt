I'm applying early action to MIT in the fall, and I'm terrified that I'm just not good enough. I have everything I need to represent myself wholly to the admissions committee, but whenever I think about it, I'm always stuck thinking, "So does every other applicant." I'm a straight-A student with deep involvement in FIRST Robotics and tons of other extracurriculars, but all I keep thinking about is that a bunch of other applications are going to say those same things about themselves and although I stand out at my school, I might not stand out to admissions.
