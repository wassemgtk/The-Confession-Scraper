I just overheard a freshman arguing that he wouldn't have a problem with a meth or heroin addict performing surgery on him or being responsible for his children. Not only do I believe that this is incredibly na√Øve and ignorant, but he was also so closed-minded and what annoyed me was that he wasn't even listening to his friend's points. He just assumes he's right and won't let anyone tell him otherwise. 

I know this guy is intelligent. The fact that he is such a smart person and is saying such insane things makes me really concerned for the world.
