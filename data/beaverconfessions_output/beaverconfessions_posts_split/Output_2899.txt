What do you do after you get a match?? do you just wait to see the person again and hope it's someplace where something might happen..do you never bring it up..do you send them a message like "lol hey look at dildo.io ;)"??? There should be at least a way to know when the other person sees the match, or a message option. wow i'm overthinking this.
