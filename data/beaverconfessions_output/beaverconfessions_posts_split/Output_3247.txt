Nothing grinds my gears as much as the Californians at MIT who complain about the weather all the time. Guess what, I don't care what the temperature is in LA right now, so don't tell me. You chose to come here, so stop bitching about how it's still cold out in April. If you can't handle it not being 70 and sunny all the fucking time, transfer to Stanford or Caltech so I don't have to listen to your nonstop whining. And if you don't want to transfer, grow a spine and learn how to deal with New England weather. This is why Northerners are tough and you're not.
