I'm so good at crying without sounds that even my roommate who sits 6ft away from me can't notice it as long as I hide my face. Just some raindrops running down my face. I just really can't deal with crying in front of people, but I cannot stop those tears from falling when life is burning me out. Bur all will get washed away, and I'll start the next day strong again.
