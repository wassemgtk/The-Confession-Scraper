One day Edison's class teacher came to his home and handed his Mom a letter. Tears rolled down her eyes as she read it. When he asked about the letter, she replied that it said "Edison is a brilliant kid in school, please take him to a better school. He deserves a good teacher." Edison believed her as he couldn't read at that time. 
Years after becoming a successful scientist, when he opened the box that contained his late mother's belongings, he found that letter. He quickly read it. Tears rolled down his eyes. The letter said "We are sorry to inform you that your child has poor learning. He may not be able to pass this class. Please find a special school for him."
