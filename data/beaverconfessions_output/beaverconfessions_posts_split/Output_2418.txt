the other day I saw my big from one of my student groups (I won't name which one in order to protect their identity) and when she was checking people in she had to ask for my name. I know I laughed it off and told you it was OK but it really hurt deep down. Am I really that unremarkable and unnoticeable of person that my own big forgets my name? I know we don't hang out all the time, but still. We at least see each other passing by in the Infinite and wave. I know this is a really small thing and I may be overreacting but this keeps bothering me and it makes me feel invisible.
