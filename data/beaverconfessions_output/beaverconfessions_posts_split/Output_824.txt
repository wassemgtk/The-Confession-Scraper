It's currently 12:38 AM. Last final is in the afternoon, and I haven't even looked at anything yet.

What's funny is that I'm only studying because all my friends are either studying for their finals and/or busy packing, so no one would play Mario kart or Mario party with me, and I don't want to watch this week's Macross Delta for the 20th time.
