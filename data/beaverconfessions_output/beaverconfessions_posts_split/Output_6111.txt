I used to help out at my old high school district board meetings for credit, and it brought up something interesting regarding school discipline. A lot of people are rightly worried about police officers in school with children. The reason so many schools do it is that lawsuit threats make it very difficult for them to enforce discipline. Any wrong gesture or accidental mark left while physically dragging a disruptive student away could lead to criminal charges for the teacher and the school. Police officers are trained how to do this properly, have experience, and can do it with minimal legal threat. If you really want to get police officers out of schools support tort reform so teachers can safely grab students who are fighting or being wildly disruptive in class.
