I've been pretty sad lately and I've realized that was makes me happy is to help others to make their lives more easy, at the expense of mine being harder. My friends seem to be working so hard while I just sit here doing nothing. I hope that they appreciate me trying to make their lives easier by staying up late just so that they don't have to work as hard on their psets.
