Remember guys, you're at the best university in the world. I'm on leave from MIT, taking classes elsewhere, and things are just not the same. It's a huge eye opener. From personal experience, I can say that at any other school you would be getting straight A's even with your hands tied behind your back. Believe in yourself because you really are gosh-dolly-darn smart. With a little bit of hard work, you can succeed at MIT too :)
