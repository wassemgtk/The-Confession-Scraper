I had a very empowering realization today that has really relieved a lot of stress. I gave up caring about getting good grades just for the sake of competition, both with classmates and the material itself, as soon as I left high school because I knew that the classes here were going to be much more difficult and that the intelligence level of all of my peers would be greater than or equal to (although most likely just strictly greater than) mine. Still though, I stressed about my GPA because I didn't want it to prevent me from getting a job. But I just realized, I don't really care about that either. The absolute worst case scenario is that my transcript is so shitty that I can't get a single job related to my major, in which case I can just move back to my hometown and get some blue-collar job, which is what all of my friends from high school are already doing, and is an option I already consider all the time anyways, even when I'm doing well in all my classes. I've realized that I'm really in a win-win situation, and boy what a freeing realization that has been.
