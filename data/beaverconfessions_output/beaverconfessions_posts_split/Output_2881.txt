I think I'm falling for my best guy friend. We met during our sophomore year, and we have been really close ever since. We're now both seniors. I'll be going to New York to work for a few years, and he's going to Korea after graduation. Part of me wants to tell him how I feel, but then I think what's the point? It'll never work out because of geography. I'm also extremely shy, so even if it weren't for geography, I probably wouldn't tell him anyways.
