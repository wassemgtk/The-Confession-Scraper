Sometimes I find it so startling to think that, barring finals week, 1 of my 4 years here is over. Not gonna lie, when I first got here I was really scared that this first year wasn't gonna go too well. I was prepared to get utterly torched by all my classes and as a person with Asperger's Syndrome, don't even get me started on what I thought about making friends I could trust. Looking back, I wish I could have reassured past me that my fears were baseless. Sure, I may not be the best in my classes, but this is MIT and I'm getting the job done. We have the brightest people on the planet here and each one of us is brilliant in our own way. As for the friends thing, I think I've truly found a wonderful group of people here and for all they've done for me this year, they deserve shoutouts for their awesomeness. So here we go.

A shoutout and many thanks to:

Yun Chang- A great neighbor and a wonderful friend. You're always willing to help with any questions I may have regarding academic material and somehow you manage to put up with my craziness every day. We've shared many a good laugh and I hope there's many more in the years ahead.

Quint Hester- One of the nicest and most trustworthy people I've ever met. Period. In everything we've worked on together this year, I thank you for tolerance of my shenanigans and for helping me understand things that I didn't get on the first go around. I may not be a Course 16, but I hope we can work together again.

Lorenzo Vigano- I always thought it would be hard to find an upperclassman friend but you destroyed that notion very quickly. I really appreciate how open and supportive you are and I'm so glad I can count on you as someone to turn to should I need. 

Joe Taglic- You're certainly not just any Average Joe. In fact, I think you're quite the Awesome Joe. Thank you for helping me when I needed it and for all the good times we spent together this year, even if it was just letting me hang out with you and Lorenzo. Also, thank you for getting me into the wild ride that is the NHL. Come on Isles!

Brandon Wang- What's it gonna be? 6? 16? 1? 12? Either way, even if you travel the road of Course 6 digits, I'm proud to call you a good friend that I can count on. Bernie Sanders is proud of you too. 

Alan Cheng- Thanks for being the ultimate Smash homie and a great guy to be around. May you continue to waveshine and show the world the truth of 20XX.

Domenic Nutile- Us MD boyz gotta stick together and that we did. Thanks for all the good times, support, the $20 ;), and for just being an epic dude no matter what. If you wanna go to Xanadu again this summer, hit me up.

Joe Griffin-I always had a blast hanging out with you this year, be it in conversation or over the Wii U. Best of luck and may you find success in your future!

Laura Koemmpel- Thank you for being such a kind soul and soothing presence as well as an epic groupmate.

Alicia Ouyang- Surprised? I bet you are. But you are the person I've known the longest that's at MIT so of course I'm giving you a shoutout. That and I also enjoyed our conversations this year, even if they were few. Keep being awesome Alicia! (If you could reach the top shelf for some Jolly Ranchers, that would be nice too.)

Nithin Buduma- Thank you for providing me with a healthy daily dose of snarkiness as well as for having good taste in being a part of the Pats Nation. Stay awesome and never change mate. 

Emma Kerwin- Mo' money, mo' problems. I really should put a South Park reference here but if I tried such a thing, I'm gonna have a bad time. Thanks for being a really chill person to be around and for all the funny moments this year.

Anthony Colangeli- I salute the 6 God of the elevator lounge. Thanks for being a total bro and making sure it's always lit fam.

Bill Peebles- If I was going to get you a gift, it would be 1989, but I feel like you have it already as a part of your shrine to Taylor Swift. Oh well. Thanks for helping grind out the psets and creating the fun that is observing the Hillary vs Bernie debates you have with Brandon.

David Rosales- One of the first people I met here and still one of the coolest people I've met here. Save the Humans is just the first of many achievements you'll have here.

Joe Iosue- I know for a fact that there's a 99.9999999999% chance you'll never read this but I'm still going to take the time to say that you're a fantastic guy and I like how you keep it real.

Henry ("the Ambassador") La Soya- You're a wonderful guy to be around with a great taste in music. Thanks for introducing me to the wonderful ball of fun that is Coup. I hope you enjoy ZBT next year!

Johnny Crawford- It's a real shame I didn't get to know you sooner this year, because you're a pretty cool guy. I look forward to working with you next semester!

Carlos Cuevas, Felipe de Quesada, Paulo Heredia, Simon Zheng and Ishan Meswani- You five are fine footballers and wonderful people. I'm glad to have played the beautiful game alongside you this year.

Lucy Yang and Miguel Young- Thank you for all of the good times this year with the Pokemon League and the opportunity to be a part of the leadership. This is just the beginning!

Nolan O'Brien, Amy Vanderhout, Charlie Garcia, Jose Rosa, Or Oppenheimer, Andrew Adams, Caralyn Cutlip, Piper Sigrest, Liza Gaylord, Nicole Zatorski and Alexa Jaeger- You all are wonderful people with a kind heart (Liza will probably object to this), and you all have created a warm, welcoming environment that has made me feel comfortable living here. This means quite a lot to me so these thanks come from the bottom of my heart.

Again, thank you to everyone listed here for making my first year at MIT a great one.
