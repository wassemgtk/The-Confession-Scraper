Random memory time: When I was a freshman I went to the free aquarium trip they offered as one of the events. I was by the shark tanks when one of the nurse sharks swam up and pressed itself against the glass in front of me. I noticed from the lack of claspers that it was a female. No one was around so I pressed up to the glass in front of her and looked her in the eye.

Boner be not proud...
