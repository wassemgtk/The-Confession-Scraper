I've got a friend who is a global warming denialist. He goes on and on about numbers, and CO2 levels over the past 600,000 years, just blah blah blah blah blah. Here's what I don't get. Even if for some stupid reason you were unsure of the evidence at this point, what's the point of being against the idea? It no longer matters whether or not global warming is real. Everyone already THINKS it's real. When everyone believes something, the truth behind it is then rendered irrelevant. It's no longer questioned, just accepted as orthodoxy. So to anyone out there who questions the science behind it. Fair warning, the rest of us believe it, we're getting the clean energy policies we want as a result, and whatever other changes are necessary for a clean world. You had best get in line voluntarily, or you're going to be forced into line. Some universities have already had government threats to have their funding pulled for supporting global warming denying professors, you want to lose your job too?
