As a departing senior, if there's one bit of advice I would give to my younger MIT self, it would be to surround myself with *good* friends sooner. Some groups can be toxic And it may take you years to realize it.
Also, to all the MIT students on this page, please just try be a better friend to all your friends in general, even when things are stressful and shitty! ESPECIALLY WHEN THINGS ARE STRESSFUL AND SHITTY!!! Remember, it costs $0 to be nice to someone. And may save someone's life.
