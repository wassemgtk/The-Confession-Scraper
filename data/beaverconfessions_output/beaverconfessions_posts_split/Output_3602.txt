I'm an undergrad on leave, and it's not going as planned. I'm struggling to use this leave to better myself, and I don't feel like I have any sort of support to do so. I withdrew socially from my home / living group at MIT long before I took leave, and abandoned a lot of my friendships and social support. I found another community to feel part of, but at best it was the 'wrong crowd' and at worst a bunch of antisocial homewrecking fuckwads. My grades and mental health have been on a steady decline since freshman year, and this didn't help either. I didn't see how things could improve if I stayed at MIT, so here I am on leave. So far, I don't feel any more comfortable returning to MIT and I feel lost on what to do about it. If you think you have any advice or perspective, I'd really appreciate hearing it. Thanks a bunch in advance.
