I really want someone at MIT to make some kind of dating matchup site (for MIT people only, using certificates), and know a lot of people who would sign up. We're all so busy with classes, and it's hard to meet new MIT people (especially for those of us that don't party). A lot of people are reluctant to use other dating sites cause there are a lot of randos.
