Dear Travis Libsack, I don't need dildo.io to say I'm DTF and ready for you to plow me like tractor. A very rusty tractor that is. One that is so rusty not even a baby can cry on top. Yeah, I want your swimmer's arms to grip onto me and tell me that I am the only one you desire, and the only one you want. I want you to tell me that you are a truly singular person and although now you experience this through pain someday that very same pain will be useful to you because anything or anyone worth their space was forged through adversity.  Your Friend "Scott" Perez
