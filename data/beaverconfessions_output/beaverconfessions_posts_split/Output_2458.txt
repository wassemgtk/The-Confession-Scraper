Sometimes, I feel like I just don't belong here. Everyone else seems to be having so much fun, and at large social events, everyone seems to know everyone else. I'm not anti-social and have a few friends who I am super close with. Yet, without them, I feel like it's very difficult to really squeeze myself into any conversations. Is this even normal?
