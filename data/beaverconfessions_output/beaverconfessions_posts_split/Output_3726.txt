This is the first presidential election I'll be eligible to vote in. I was super excited for this day growing up, but if the elections turn out the way they're heading right now, I might not even end up voting. Thanks America, for making two of the worst candidates possible frontrunners. If I do end up casting a vote this year, it will only be to reserve the right to criticize whoever ends up getting elected with the knowledge that I did my part to try to prevent it.
