I never felt this insecure in my entire life, and I never used to be like this. I used to love myself and not care what other ppl thought of me. But ever since I came here, I've felt so small and unworthy compared to my peers. I constantly feel pressured to be like my hall mates, do what they do, say what they say and act 'cool', even though i don't even know what 'cool' is. I used to like being different and standing out in a crowd. I used to enjoy being myself, but all I want to do now is be one of them. I feel like everything is right, except being "me".
