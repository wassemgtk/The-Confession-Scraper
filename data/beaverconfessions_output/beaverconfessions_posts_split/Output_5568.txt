I feel like the question of Syrian refugees is simple, but not in the way I see some people breaking it down. The choice as I see it is A) Does the US accept the refugees, knowing it is likely that some percentage of them will be malicious agents taking advantage of the crisis to immigrate, or B) Does the US accept none of them (or perhaps a third option, does the US accept a subset that is likely to be harmless? Eg. children only, though that would be heartbreaking for those families and not necessarily the best option for those children, etc.).

To argue that innocent refugees should be welcomed because they're decent human beings is to argue against a straw man (Well, it may SHOULD be arguing against a straw man, though some politicians' comments seem to indicate they might actually be opposed to this sentiment...). If governments had divining rods that could tell who was and wasn't intending to perpetrate violence on others, this decision would be much more straightforward.

I just wanted to articulate this distinction. I think it's very possible to be in favor of A) above; but the proper articulation is "I support accepting all of the refugees, because helping the innocent ones is more important than preventing the damage that might be caused by the malicious agents", not simply "I support welcoming Syrians". (Does this sound accurate to people? I am by zero means a domain expert, here)
