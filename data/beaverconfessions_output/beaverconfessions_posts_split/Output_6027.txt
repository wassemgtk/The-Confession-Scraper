I feel bad for Prof. Entala Nako and Prof. Bob Weinberg. Just because she's not an epic professor like Lander, nobody claps for them when 7.012 lecture is over. Meanwhile, Lander gets all the appreciation. Nako and Weinberg are working hard too and they try their best to teach you the material while keeping you engaged. Give them a little happiness by being grateful -- maybe they'll do better as they get more positivity from us, the students.
