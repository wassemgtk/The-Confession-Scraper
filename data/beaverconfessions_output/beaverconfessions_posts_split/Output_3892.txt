These days
I have my days and my bad days
But I only cry when my guitar won't play
Anyways
I've been rolling, stoned
And I've gathered moss
I've tripped and fallen 
And I've been drunk and lost
I can't quite remember the things that ensued
When I thought about dying those same afternoons
When all the stars were aligned, except for my few
No I won't buy a whole pack if I just want to smoke two
Those days
I hadn't dreamt yet of you
