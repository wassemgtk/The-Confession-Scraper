One thing that is driving me crazy in this transgender debate is what a transgender woman is. I think it's medically dishonest to call that a woman. What it really comes down to is a transgender woman is a man who has been castrated with a mutilated penis, added estrogen, and possibly a couple other cosmetic procedures. He does not have ovaries, a uterus, natural breasts, female hip structure, cannot reproduce, in short does not medically qualify as a woman. You can't actually switch gender.
