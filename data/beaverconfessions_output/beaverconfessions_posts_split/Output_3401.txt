After being deferred during early action, on Pi Day I GOT IN! I know that MIT won't be a walk in the park, but I'm so happy to finally be a part of the adventure with all of y'all. I have followed this confessions page obsessively for the past year, and I understand how hard the next four years are going to be, but I can't help and be more excited for MIT than I've ever been excited about anything else in my life. IHTFP! See you all at CPW ! :)
