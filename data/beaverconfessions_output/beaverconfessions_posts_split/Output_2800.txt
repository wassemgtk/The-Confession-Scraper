I have endometriosis, a disease where uterine tissue grows outside the uterus, causing *extreme* pain, scarring and damage on nearby organs, and sometimes infertility. I've been getting symptoms that suggest that it might have affected my intestines or bowels, and I wanted to get more information before going to the doctor about it. I googled, and below are two of the top five results I got. If you ever wanted proof that sexism exists, this is what webpages for information about female diseases look like. Note the juxtaposition between the content of the writing and Barbie-esque web design.
