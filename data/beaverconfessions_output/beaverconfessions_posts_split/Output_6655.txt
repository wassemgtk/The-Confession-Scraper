As a guy I am actually frightened by how much girls seem to be willing to do sexually. Granted, I have only my own narrow spectrum. I talked to my dad about what girls are willingly to do now and he was baffled. He talked about coming here in the 60's and how back then you didn't even get into bed with most girls until you were married or you promised her marriage. The reason it concerns me is how I'm honestly not sure how a lot of guys are going to be able to have normal relationships with one woman after getting Caligula style acts from various women. I'll admit it was really hard for me to settle down with one girl now. Guys, it is honestly worth it, but you have to train yourself to enjoy it.
