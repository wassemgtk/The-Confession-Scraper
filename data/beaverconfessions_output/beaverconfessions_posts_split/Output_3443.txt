I used to be so outgoing, but being here has kind of made me more shy.
There is this guy in several of my classes, and I really think he is cute and I eye-fuck him when he walks by but I literally don't know his name at all. I haven't come across him on Facebook, so chances are he might not even read this.
BUT if you do happen to read MIT Confessions, next time I eye-fuck you (hopefully tomorrow morning) ask me for my name pls! Maybe eventually we will hold hands and skip in the summer sun and actual-fuck.
