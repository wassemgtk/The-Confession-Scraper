how can I give feedback on classes that are being seriously mismanaged? S3 has not been able to help. http://ua.mit.edu/policy/violations/ is a broken page on the website and has not caused action in the past when I've submitted complaints. talking to the professor has done nothing so far. I don't know what to do.
