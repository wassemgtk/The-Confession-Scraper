I'm tired of all the I'm so lonely/depressed/suicidal posts on here. It's not that those aren't important feelings, but it's useless to post them here. We have the same conversation about them every time. Literally can we have a link that compiles all these responses, and everytime someone's feeling down, just link them instead?
