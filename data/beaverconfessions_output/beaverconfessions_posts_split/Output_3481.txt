I took a break from my relationship because I wanted to see what it was like to be with other people. I thought there had to be other girls like her and she's not the only one. I thought I didn't want to miss out on college by being with one person. The only experiences I had proved that she is the most special person in my life. I ruined our relationship because I couldn't see what an amazing girl I had in front of me. Things aren't the same anymore. I wish I could start over and that I never asked for a pause.
