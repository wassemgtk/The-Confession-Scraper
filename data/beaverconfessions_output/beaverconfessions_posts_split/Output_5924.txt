Okay, I have a serious question about transgender people. Say someone decides that they want to start identifying as the other gender. Doesn't that just mean that they identify with stereotypes corresponding to the other gender more? And so isn't that a contradiction to the feminist ideal of eliminating gender stereotypes?

I'm new to being vocal about this kind of thing, so I'm probably missing something. Thoughts?
