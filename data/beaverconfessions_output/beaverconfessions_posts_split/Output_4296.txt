When you guys hear the term “punt a pset” do you also think of yourself kicking a stack of papers like punting a football? Is this a common thing?

I kind of thought it was analogous to a football team being 4th down and 10; you’re kinda like well I could go for it but I probably won’t make it and also I just don’t wanna go through the pain. So fuck it. *punts*
