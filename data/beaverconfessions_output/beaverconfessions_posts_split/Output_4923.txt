@3531, MIT guys can dress however they damn well please. I'd say the reason they're wearing t-shirts is that they care more about being comfortable than they do about impressing you. I feel like this wouldn't even be a discussion if someone were dictating the clothing of MIT girls.

Also, guys in fancy clothes might be what you're into, but that doesn't mean everyone is. I personally prefer guys in fluffy pajamas with cute animals on them...
