I am slowly coming to terms with my deep indifference towards my career. I really wouldn't mind working as a barista for the rest of my life. Work is supposed to be a way to afford a life and not life itself. I don't see why I should want anything more than the minimum....
 And this makes me feel awful for making my parents pay for an over-priced education I don't even truly want. Should I admit this to them and drop out? I am pretty sure they would think I am having a mental break-down and try to make me see a therapist.
