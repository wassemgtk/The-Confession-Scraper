I was a big Bernie supporter this election and I liked what he brought to the table. There is one issue I need to bring up that I think some of the supporters were not getting. I felt that the mentality was wrong. America is a very individualistic society with individualistic sacrifices and benefits such as lower taxes for lower benefits. Northern Europe has a communal mentality, everyone pays more in taxes for more benefits. The issue I had with many of the other Bernie supporters was how they assumed they would get communal benefits, but with no communal sacrifice. For example, everyone was on board with the idea of socialized healthcare and universal free public college, but not paying for it themselves. Here's the reality, the wealthy in this nation hold about 1.5 trillion in assets. To expand college and healthcare in that manner, it would cost 2 - 3 trillion extra in the national budget. We could rob the rich blind and still come up short. In most Northern European countries the average person pays 50% in taxes, in the US it's about 28% - 30% for the average person. Most of the other Bernie supporters I talked to assumed "the rich" would pay for everything. The reality is we will all have to pay a lot more in taxes, we will get a lot more in exchange, however. And for those of you who argue that we just need to raise corporate taxes, every single country in Europe has lower corporate tax rates, then we do. We can't raise them any more. My point is, if you love Bernie's ideas, but aren't willing to pay a lot more in taxes yourself, take a hike, because you really aren't for his ideas, you are a left wing tourist, who loves the fun, but doesn't want to make the effort.
