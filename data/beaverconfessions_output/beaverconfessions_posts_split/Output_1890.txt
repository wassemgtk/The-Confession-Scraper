I'm really just feeling like a piece of garbage today. This has been my worst semester academically by far and I have no one to blame but myself. 

I'll probably do fine in 3/4 of my classes, but in that 4th one I think I'm royally fucked. I say 'think', because I honestly have no idea where I stand in that class. I pretty much haven't been to lecture in over a month besides to take a midterm, I skipped both the lectures where the midterms were returned, and the grades were never posted online (not like I just can't see my score, but like there isn't even a spot in the gradebook for the midterm grades) so I don't even know what my score was on either midterm. I've done astoundingly mediocre on the psets overall, and even if I do well on the remaining ones I can still only get about half of the points that could have possibly been earned from psets. And it's all totally my fault. 

Besides the lectures I had to miss to be able to finish work for other classes on time (which is still the result of my own procrastination, but is at least justifiable in the moment), there was no reason for me to miss any lectures. Not that I would have paid much attention anyways, and not that it would have helped that much since (for me at least) the lectures in the first half of the semester were all disorganized, rarely helped me on the psets at all, and mostly just left me frustrated and confused. But it still would have been better to at least go. 

The vast majority of points I've missed on psets have been the result of just not answering questions, either because I procrastinated for so long that there wasn't enough time, or because I was so lazy and discouraged by how little the questions seemed to have to do with anything we talked about in lecture that I just couldn't bring myself to actually put in the effort to figure out how to answer them. 

I should have taken advantage of sophomore exploratory, but I know that realistically that would have almost certainly resulted in me just giving up on the class immediately. I should have talked to the professor before drop date to find out if I was still in a position to pass the class, but I didn't want to go through the embarrassment that discussion would have entailed since it's a small class and the professor knows I haven't been coming to lecture (and the professor has demonstrated himself to be somewhat of a total cunt, so I doubt he would have made it any easier for me). 

And now I don't know what to do. I just feel like such a fuck up. Not to humblebrag (since it's not something worth bragging about at all), but I could very realistically be doing great here. If you consider how poor my study habits have been, how much I've procrastinated, and how little effort I've put in to academics since coming here, it's a miracle that I haven't failed every class. I've actually even done pretty well overall, but that just means that I could probably have close to a 5.0 if I had actually tried anywhere near as hard as I did in high school. But still somehow my awareness of this idiotic behavior has yet to actually influence me to behave differently. 

I guess I could go to S^3, although I don't see how there's anything we could talk about that would actually help me now. I could try to petition to drop the class after drop date, but who knows if that would even work, and who knows if I'm actually even failing (I mean isn't a 50% like a B in a lot of classes after the curve or whatever?). I could make some excuses about depression and issues with my medication, but it seems a little late for that, and I'm not sure what good it would do anyways. I wouldn't be lying, and I'm sure those issues had some impact on my poor schoolwork, but ultimately I was just being lazy. And it's not like I deserve any sympathy from the professor. I can't use the old "Even though I did poorly, I still tried my hardest and did all the work, so how can you FAIL me?" argument, because I very clearly didn't try my hardest, and I didn't do all the work.

I'm sure that in the grand scheme of things it doesn't really matter, but it still feels shitty. Not because I have any ego-related issues with getting a bad grade, but because I know I was capable of doing better and still just didn't. But anyways, that's it for my bitchy, self-pitying rant. I'm sure this is of little interest to most, but hey, at least it's actually kind of a confession and not just some angry political diatribe.
