People always complain about "Oh, I set up walls that no one can break down. I barely open up." No, your walls crumble pretty damn easily now a days. All it takes is some muscular body, a beard, and a slicked hair style. My "walls" are mountains with twist and turns that you'll have to crawl over, upon which you'll find a mote of Laval flame you'll need to cross on a small boat somewhere along the coastline. That boat can get you across, barely. After the boat is withered to ash and you've made it, you'll find a dark castle of brimstone and a bizarre feeling of "what have I found?". here there's a door of gold and white. You'll want to open it. Yet as you reach for it, three steel armored attack trolls known as anger, paranoia, and territorial will great you. You must slay them with nothing more than a mere shortsword which is slightly rusted. After you manage such a feat, you may enter. Upon entry, you follow the corridors of a very interesting and mysterious mind. You're not done. The main entrance to the last room seems opened but is locked. You now have to find the lock key. It's generously on the table next to you. You open the door to a five headed monstrous Hydra. He isn't happy. He is doubt. He is what shall test you more and more. A throne of bright white and red lays behind him. His master is upon the throne, clad in a black and white tail coat suit. Black boots, slack, vest, tie, white button up, leather fingerless gloves. That is me. If anyone feels their "walls" are similar. Please share.
