To anonymously add help to #2604: at MIT, we can go to VPR, Violence Prevention and Response on the fourth floor of Medical. They will help you navigate the legal system outside MIT should you decide to press charges, recuperation, and academics. They're very lovely people that are exempt from some of the reporting bindings that the rest of MIT Mental Health and Support Services have for obvious reasons. So, if you find yourself in that situation, go there as a first step. They'll help you navigate things at a time when you'll be too overwhelmed to do so.
