When I came to MIT I had this hope that the students would be different than the rest of the population.  Now as a senior, that expectation has been thoroughly proven false.  The people I live around on my floor  are such terrible people, as is the everyone else.  Just walking around on Halloween night made me sick, as does reading some confessions with comments on getting shitfaced.  Really? Is that all you guys think about?  Is that all you aspire to?  You all may be good at academics, but you are all still just spoiled brats, who live in a fantasy world, where there are no consequences and someone else cleans up your messes.  But I guess that's the way the whole world works anyways, so I have to get used to it.
