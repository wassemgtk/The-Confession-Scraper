that feeling when i'm dealing with body image issues and think 'fat little piggy' when i look into the mirror, and when i'm so hungry my stomach hurts but i can't bring myself to eat food 

and then soylent saves the day because i can count the number of calories i'm ingesting and at least i'll have enough willpower to finish my pset if i don't have enough to be more skinny. 

i know i have problems but at least i'm coping?
