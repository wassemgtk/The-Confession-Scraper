Sometimes I wish I could be the work robot a lot of you on here complain about being. Emotions and thoughts always distract me so it'd be more efficient that way. I get the cliche that you can't feel the real highs without knowing the lows, but if ideally you could feel nothing, and feel nothing about feeling nothing, you'd profit. I could be straight grinding out work and gaining the respect of everyone who doesn't know me & thinks I'm worthless or lazy, including myself. I don't think I want to be lazy like this, but if that's true couldn't I just take it in my hands & push for a comeback? I feel like I've spent all of my years here falling into bad cycles & just submitting midsemester to whatever hole I dug myself into that time around.
Any suggestions on finding the confidence, willpower, and (always scarce) time to make comebacks? Or thoughts on how to transform into a work robot in spite of the maybe harsh realization that you'd face some isolating effects?
Thoughts on anything really?
