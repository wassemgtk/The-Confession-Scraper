I'm pretty comfortable with academics, but this PE class is kicking my ass. How the hell can I apply this concept when I just learned it two minutes ago, and I still can't do that thing I was supposed to have learned last class? This TA is telling me to relax, but the second I do I fall over. And how the hell are some of the students running circles around me? Did they already learn this in high school?

Agh. I need a review session or something.
