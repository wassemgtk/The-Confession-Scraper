Its 3:00 a.m.
And im silently crying in my bed. No one knows im crying. No one cares for me. I feel lonely almost all the time. Idk how much longer i can force myself to live unnoticed. Walk unnoticed through the hallways, attend classes unnoticed, and get grades (even good ones) unnoticed. Am I really unworthy of being loved by someone?  If this is how its gonna be for the next 10 years, i cant take it any more. I rather end it now.
