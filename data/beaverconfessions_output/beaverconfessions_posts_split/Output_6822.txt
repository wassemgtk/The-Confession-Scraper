Her mother said that Tina loved MIT. 

She even insisted that it be said at the memorial, but I don’t think anyone listened. We were too busy screaming at the administration and lamenting our “deplorable” mental health system to possibly listen to something so contrary to our preconceptions.

The second Reif’s email was sent, our minds were made up. We saw the headline and we extrapolated a story. A story about a lonely, depressed, isolated girl who clearly just needed a little more support from her friends and a little better institutionalized mental health system to keep going. For the vast majority of us, the Tina we mourn is the Tina we projected - invented, even - from just a few tiny little facts that correlate so little with the person underneath. 

Remember Orientation? And REX? Remember meeting hundreds upon hundreds of people, and asking them all the same three questions? Where are you from? Where do you live? What’s your major? And do you remember that delicate, thoughtful realization two months later that all three of those data points mean jack shit about the person living behind those bullet points.

It’s horrible. Cruel. Cold, even. But we did it. We did it to our classmates, we did it to Matthew, and we did it to Christina. We filled in the gaps of what we don’t know with whatever we decided “should” make sense. We fabricated causes and reasons and circumstances and what-if’s and should-have’s. We projected our own issues and struggles and demons into their lives. And by the time the real details were released it was too late, because we’d already solidified our snap judgments about how and why. We’d already deduced “the story”, and nothing would dissuade us from raising our voices and taking up the “noble cause” to fight whatever villain we decided to lynch - in this case, the administration. Or “the culture”. Or Columbo. I’m not even sure, maybe we haven’t finished casting the role yet. I’m sure we will soon.

It’s shocking - in a very literal sense - when something this tragic happens in our community. But we need to be very careful of our own biases, lest they run wild and cause even more collateral damage. Maybe change needs to happen. Probably. But it can’t happen in an emotional frenzy, and it definitely shouldn't be driven by the ghost of a shell we thought we knew.

Tina loved MIT. Always remember that.
