I was a big Bernie supporter, but now that he's lost election, I'm starting to realize my support inevitably lies more with Trump. I refuse to vote for the definition of the establishment, a candidate who is controlled by donors and her party. Trump may be a piece of shit, but at least he's an honest piece of shit that has been shown to change some of his positions when the people didn't agree with them. I don't know if I have the heart to vote for him, but I secretly hope he wins because fuck Clinton.
