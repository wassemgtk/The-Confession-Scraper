OK. Like anyone, I came to this school as one of the high school overachievers, IB, AP, VP, clubs, sports, everything. I'm also quite social. Now as a second year, I still struggle. I worked so fucking hard in first year and got very good GPA by spending all my time on labs, test preps. But grad schools really don't look at your 1st GPA anyway, and there's no job opportunity for freshmen in research or industry. Now onto year 2 where your GPA really matters, I'm simply to tired to continue. I got into several hackthons and I couldn't go cuz I can't even finish my own labs. EECS here. I also got an interview from a prof and the answer was "this is a part time job throughout the term, your timetable indicates that we need someone who has more free time than you." Then I talked to other profs, and all they want are high GPA students. The only reason they would talk to me is b/c I have a OK cGPA from freshman year to average our my current 2.5s. As soon as I show them my complete transcript, GG. 
How can people be so smart? Like those ones who can still get involved in so many activities and still ace everything? People who work for Google since freshman year, get full scholarships, know so many upper year overachievers, found their own startup. What exactly is your schedule, not course schedule, your own daily routine? Do you ever sleep? How can some people just good at everything? And the most depressing part is that they also have boyfriend/girlfriend.
