Hey member of whatever team that practices until 2ish in the Dance Studio, next time you use the bathroom in McC, take care to listen to the sounds around you. I'm pretty sure I peed loud enough, but if that's not a clear enough message, just realize there's someone else in the stall next to you before you go and turn the damn lights off.
