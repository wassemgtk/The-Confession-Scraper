people don't like it when I make comments about the confessions, but I can't just sit back on this one. I think we all have a right to be upset about what happened a year ago yesterday. The bombings happened right across the river in the city we currently live in. Of course we're going to want to help out as much as we can; we feel like we relate to this incident more. Sure, there have been situations overseas that have led to more casualties, but god damn man, just because we don't personally know victims of the bombings doesn't mean we aren't #BostonStrong. Get your head out of your ass and let us, as a school and as a city, come together. Don't tell us what to do.

The 'confession' is posted below. As always, feel free to comment/debate. 

Personally, the bombings last year (since they happened 20 minutes after I left the finish line where I was watching the marathon), made me realize that life is precious and short, and that I shouldn't take anything for granted. So, excuse me for wanting to be #BostonStrong.

Also, don't talk shit about this amazing country we live in. Merica.

4 people died. Dozens were injured. #BostonStrong was the most tweeted hashtag for weeks after the event. The One Fund raised over $100 million to support the victims. New Balance is advertising their new "Boston" shoes. Someone at Wellesley wrote a song commemorating the occasion, and 100 people sang it on the radio.

Now imagine watching all this from the point of view of a man in Syria who just lost his home and family in a bombing. Or from the POV of a Sudanese boy whose arm was cut off via machete by rebel forces. Or from the POV of a human trafficking victim who gets raped every day. Or from the POV of a Vietnamese slave working in triple digit weather building skyscrapers in Dubai.

And not to mention: most MIT kids don't even know a victim of the bombings. Most of you sat at home watching the TV while police led a wild goose chase for 2 small time terrorists. Please tell me how you are #BostonStrong.

Tragedies happen every day. What happened to quiet resilience? What happened to keeping your head down and moving on with life when bad things happen?

Americans are the best in the world at blowing smoke up their own arses. But hey, whatever makes you feel important. #BostonStrong #BornInTheUSA'
