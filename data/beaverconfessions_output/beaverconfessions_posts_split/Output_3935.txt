sometimes i think i'm a god and that the point of life is to transcend our humanness (and thereby become the most human we can be) and gogdamm am i productive and shit but then other times i just feel like literal trash and don't get out of bed until it's already dark out again and i wonder if maybe i'm a little bipolar? but it's never interfered significantly with my functioning so there's never been reason to try and diagnose but maybe i could be functioning a lot better? idk?? my mental health is just kinda "what" and i claim to be more stable than i was a year and a half ago but i'm really not that sure actually
