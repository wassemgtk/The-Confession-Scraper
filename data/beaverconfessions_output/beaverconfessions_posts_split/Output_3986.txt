i want to do _this_ with my life, i just want to study math, but over and over i get slapped in the face by grades, and i can make up reasons for why i failed to meet my own expectations in previous semesters (no sleep, psychological instability, etc. etc.), but even now i'm proceeding through an uneventful semester, except for the fact that i'm still falling short. the only reason i even care about grades is because i want to go to grad school but even with that carrot dangled in front of me, even with that motivation i still fall short.

is this how studying math is? is it a constant struggle just not to drown?
