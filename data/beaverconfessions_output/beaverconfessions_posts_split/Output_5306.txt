I find it pretty interesting when people who have recently graduated MIT still comment on MIT Confessions, email on mailing list threads, etc. I guess some people are still around campus doing MEng and work and stuff..but even so I find it a little odd that some people really didn't move on from undergrad enough to find new hobbies, etc. Is this what life after MIT is like?

I kind of hope that I have more of a life after MIT than to spend my Saturday night spamming Sponge-Talk...
