Sigh. Just bought another dildo because the current ones redmind me of my abusive ex. To be honest I had a favorite she would use on me but it's too big for me to use it on my own.  Basically getting the same model but smaller. Now I'm just worried about having to explain my big toy collection to the next girl I'm comfortable enough to open up with.

This is one of my most hidden secrets, but as a mostly straight guy, being pegged is one of the most intimate things I can experience. Something kept personal between my partner and I, where I give up that control, and put so much trust in someone else.  Even in the cycle of abuse it was one of the times where I felt most safe and loved.  It's beyond purely physical for me. In fact I usually don't even pay attention to the physical aspect, it's just such an emotional experience for me.  Not even something that I like to do that often, just so impactful when I do.

I don't want to be broken.  I want to trust someone again.
