I think I was a little harsh before.  I don't hate you.  In fact I don't think there is a single person that I do hate.  But I often wish that I could just write you off as a bad person as it would be easier to forget about you as I have others.  But I can't seem to do that with you.  Instead I can't help but feel that you just don't want to face my emotions, for one reason or another.  But that's just a theory.  A game theory.
