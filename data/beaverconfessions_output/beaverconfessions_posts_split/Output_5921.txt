To all those people that decide to come to class without showering for weeks and think it is a great idea to sit among people when the desk space is nonexistent: WE CAN SMELL YOU. You are actually making it extremely hard for me to concentrate in lecture when my nose is being overwhelmed by a foul odor that makes me want to curl up into a ball and roll away as far as possible.

SHOWER or don't come to class.
