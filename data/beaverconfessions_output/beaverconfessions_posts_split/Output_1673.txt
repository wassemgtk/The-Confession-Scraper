I wasn't expecting to get over liking you so quickly. Maybe I never liked you that much after all? Or I realized how incompatible we would have been after talking to someone whose eyes light up when they talk about what they're interested in, and who stayed and talked with me for an hour and half even though we both had work to do. I don't think you would have ever done that. You're nice and all, but not that nice.
