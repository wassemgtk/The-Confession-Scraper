I am an undecided Democrat. I honestly don't understand why people are giving the students sending the Bernie Sanders emails so much shit. I don't see any Clinton groups. Or any GOP candidate groups. Or politically active student groups in general (save maybe Fossil Free). Stop complaining about their support of this specific candidate, and start your own group for your candidate of choice. Hell, I'd *appreciate* other groups being formed, it would be nice to see a more politically involved campus. And it'd be a great way to inform students about different issues and candidates. These students are to be commended for their civic involvement. Also, not all of their events have to do specifically with Sanders. They've done straight up voter registration stuff which is super important. These students do have a right to free speech, and I'm sure everyone gets dorm spam emails about clubs they don't care about or don't agree with.
