Was seeing a girl from Brown this summer and it was going pretty well for a couple of weeks. We had common interests, the time with her was fun and I found her to be smoking hot. We even talked about continuing the relationship during school since getting to brown from MIT is not that difficult.

But then in a sudden moment the girl blocks me off on social media and stops responding to any messages. I was feeling confused and weirded out. What did I do wrong? Later she replied with a vague reason to stop seeing each other. I am still not sure if I dodged a bullet or missed out on something great.
