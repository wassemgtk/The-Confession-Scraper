To the international kid who feels wrong done by: I feel you. MIT has to up its support to international kids because some, if not most of them are gonna become perm residents or citizens of the US anyway. As an American whose origins are outside America, I side with you. There's not much of a difference between an American and an international coz most Americans are international, anyway, if u know what i mean.
