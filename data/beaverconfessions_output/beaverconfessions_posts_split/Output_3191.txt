To the people getting pissed at people shit talking EC, you're completely ignoring the fact that EC culture is polarizing and can feel ostracizing to someone not willing to submit to their halls respective vibes. Also, if leave your hall, you get shunned. Join an FSILG other than tEp or pika, get shunned. This isn't everyone, not even close, but certain people tend to perpetuate this vibe. Let people be upset with EC. Let people have feelings other than the ones you want them to have. Respect the fact that college is stressful and people want a place to call home and that home isn't the same for everyone.
