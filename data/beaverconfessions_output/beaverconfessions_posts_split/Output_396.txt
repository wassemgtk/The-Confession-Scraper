Its been a while since ive started feeling so alone in my life. I dont have a boyfriend and i don't think anyone will ever be interested in me. All my friends reach out to me when its p-set time, but they wont ever remember me when they're having fun. For the past month my head had been running crazy, its been working at full speed and throwing all sorts of crazy thoughts at me about myself/my life. I have recently started thinking about a way just to be able to shut it down; ive thinking heavy alcohol or drugs.
Please make it stop. I cant take it anymore.
