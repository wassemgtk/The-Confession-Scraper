Shoutout to Camilo Espinosa - the man literally does everything: TAs some difficult bio class (7.05 I believe), yet still finds the time to have killer dance performances for Donk and DT. And to top it off, the guy still has a smile on his face and a positive attitude when I see him around.

To make a long story short... Camilo is the shit... Camilo have my babies. <3
