Dear UAAP, 

Please give me a legitimate reason as to why I cannot drop my freshman advising seminar. I signed up thinking that Concourse was required, but now you guys are putting me through a logistical nightmare and won't let me replace it with something else?? What's the point of forcing me to no-record a class?? This is how you treat your students? 

If anyone's gone through something like this, please help.
