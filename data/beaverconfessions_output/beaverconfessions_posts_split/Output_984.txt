Why must the food on campus be so fucking shitty? Jesus fucking Christ. There's so much of an emphasis on taking care of yourself and exercising, but when the only options that are readily available are overcooked, tasteless slabs of meat, overcooked, dry rice, and the occasional potato, how the fuck are we supposed to stay healthy? This has a negative impact not only on physical health, but also on mental health!

And meh, I figure why not throw this out there: You know those companies that administer the dining areas and rooms? Rumor has it that they have financial ties to members in the administration. But hey, who needs a student union, right? The UA does such a GREAT job of representing our interests and wields SO much power and influence. It's not like if the students don't unionize, the administration won't treat them like shit, right?
