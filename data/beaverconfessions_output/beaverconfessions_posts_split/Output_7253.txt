MIT Medical why do you make me go through a primary care provider to get tested for STI's?! I don't have a primary care provider and I don't want to have to wait until I get one and can get an appointment which can take quite a while to be tested. STI's are the sort of thing that it is better to let students get tested for SOONER rather than LATER. This really, REALLY should be available through urgent care.
