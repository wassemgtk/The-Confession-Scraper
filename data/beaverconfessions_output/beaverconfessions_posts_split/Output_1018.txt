if you're a parent and you're on mit confessions, you're a helicopter parent. leave your fucking kid alone. 

(also the same reason I hate giving parent tours during cpw -- your kid should choose where to live. I get that some parents (not mine!) pay for their kids' schooling, but seriously, your kids are going to have to live their own lives at some point. Start letting them make their own choices and stop worrying so damn much.)
