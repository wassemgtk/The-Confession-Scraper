I fell in love with the post-doc I worked with in my UROP. No, I didn't just have a crush on him, I fell legitimately in love with this guy. He was married. He had children. Did that stop my idiot brain? NOPE. "Lucky" for me he left MIT. I have been numb for going on four months now...My life is so much better this way.
