@5384 Are you fucking kidding me? Sure, guys face some challenges in their attempts to get laid, but don't forget about all the stereotypes and gender roles that the society imposes on BOTH genders. Females have to be feminine, take really good care of their body and always look charming. It is a constant work and standards for girls are way higher than for guys. Besides, if a guy wants to get laid he just needs to come up to a girl and start a conversation. If a girl wants to get laid, she has to wait for a guy to get interested in her. Why? Because of fuckers just like you that would otherwise slut shame her.

Why don't we make it easier for both genders? Just treat males and females equally. If one wants to have sex, explore more sexual partners, or stay with one person, let them do that regardless of gender and don't shame anyone. Desire to have sex is perfectly normal. Slut shaming girls you make it harder for yourself to get laid: if a girl that sleeps with several guys is a slut, she has to be more selective and will reject you if you don't pass for a long-term relationship. Just don't be a dick, don't shame sluts and don't praise studs - let everyone make decisions they are comfortable with.
