idk why (jk i know well why its because i despise myself) but somewhere along the way i just subconsciously decided to ruin this semester for myself. i feel awful for all the people that tried to help me--my friends, my sorority, my TAs, my professors especially. please don't feel like my poor grades were your fault. you did everything you could. but there's not much you can do to help someone who doesn't want to help themselves.
