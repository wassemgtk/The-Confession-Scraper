Regarding Active Consent:

I've seen some people commenting that constantly checking up on their partner mid-sex is unreasonable or awkward. But it really isn't. Every once in a while you ask them how they're doing: "do you like this?", "are you having fun?", "what would you like?", things like that. And if their response isn't as enthusiastic as you expect them to be, or if there isn't a response, or you have reason to believe they might not be having a good time, just remind them that you guys can stop at any time and that you won't mind. Nothing big, just once in a while, depending on how long it lasts.

I was brought up in a culture where girls are taught to put others' wants before their own needs, and while I don't believe this should be true for anyone else, I have a hard time not doing this myself. Sometimes during sex with my boyfriend I find myself thinking, "oh, this hurts... but it doesn't hurt *that* much, and I want him to feel good... maybe I can endure it till he's done", and I can't bring myself to tell him to stop even though I'm having a really bad time. Luckily, my boyfriend really cares about active consent and he asks how I'm doing, and if I'm hesitant to answer, he reminds me that it's alright to stop. This has really helped me get better at letting him know how I feel, which in the end helps sex become a good experience for both of us, physically and emotionally.

I don't know how many people will share the exact specifics of my story but I think a lot of people will resonate with it. 

I mean, you care about your partner, right? You want them to feel good. So just ask them and make sure they are, it's really not hard.
