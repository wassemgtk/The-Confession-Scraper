I've never believed that life has a purpose, and for the most part have been okay with that fact, but this weekend I had such a terrible existential crisis, I stopped doing all my work, sat down in a dark basement, and stared at a wall for a good hour.  I've usually used anchoring as my technique for dealing with this feeling, but it seems to be failing.  There are certainly things out there that I enjoy, and I know what I want to do with my life, but I do not consider any activity or hobby I enjoy strong enough to be an anchor.  The one thing I do genuinely care about is people, and I've used those close to me as my anchor, but now I'm starting to lose that a bit.  I think it's the fact that during the week I realized that my closest friends are all either not as close as I thought or are going to graduate soon.  I'm not trying to say that I have terrible friends, in fact I find this school is full of the most amazing people and I've formed so many meaningful relationships, but my friends have SOs that trump any relationship I could hope to forge with them.  I think this is simply a fact of life, and at first was okay with this, but after not being in a relationship for years now I have come to miss the intimacy that comes with it.  I've made attempts to get closer to others in this regard, but I find it difficult to have feelings for others, and of those I do care for in this aspect either have someone already or never have and are not willing to start now.  I know my family cares for me but I find it hard to connect with them when I consider them, for the most part, terrible people.  As far as other mechanisms go I find isolation and distraction to be impossible.  I did go through a period of sublimation in high school where I would write poetry, and it helped significantly, but as of late I find no motivation or desire to do so again.  I'm very interested to hear what anchors or sublimation techniques other people in a similar situation use, or perhaps a different technique altogether.
