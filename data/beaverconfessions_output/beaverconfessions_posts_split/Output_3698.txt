I have a class where your entire grade comes from group work. And my group took on way too much. I told them this, and we even talked to the professor, and he said "it's manageable if you put in extra work". I DON'T WANT TO PUT IN EXTRA WORK. but my simple idea for the project was outvoted. I have no problem with ambition but if people don't follow through what they started i'm gonna be real pissed.
