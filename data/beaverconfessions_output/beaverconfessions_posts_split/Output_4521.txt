PSA: If you're texting/messaging someone regularly and they aren't responding, stop. They aren't "busy" or "playing hard to get"; they're not interested. Even when people text back asking the texter to stop, the texter takes that as interest and pursues further. It sickens me how almost every woman I know has a story of a guy who kept texting them, for weeks, months, and even longer.
