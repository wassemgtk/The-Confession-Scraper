I feel like such a failure. So many people here work so much they literally couldn't sleep more than 7h a week even if they never procrastinated or had any social interaction and I, what, decide that my problems are for some reason more real than theirs so I get to drop half my workload and have so much time to just lay in bed being sad when I'm sure they'd also love to do that but aren't lazy and just get their shit done. Even though I was completely truthful, I feel like I selected parts of my life to misrepresent myself on my MIT application and I don't deserve to be here. Above all, I feel like I'm just using mental health as an excuse to be lazy.
