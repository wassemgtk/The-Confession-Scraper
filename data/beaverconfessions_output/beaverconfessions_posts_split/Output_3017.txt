I don't spend all my time in my classes, I have some free time. And whenever I'm not working, I'm in my room just watching youtube. What's a better way to spend my time at MIT?

I'm serious, what are things people spend their time on here aside from academics? Chillin in their living group? Hobbies? Idk...
