Bernie Sander's standpoint on the Palestinian/Israeli conflict makes me happy! I am glad I live in an era when a US presidential candidate decided to discuss this issue openly. He also recognizes Palestinians as much as he recognizes Israelis for pretty much the first time in history! I think we should raise more awareness about the conflict so that ignorant/shallow people can understand a bit more about what's going on in the Middle East. I feel some people are opinionated about the conflict with no bases of knowledge/facts/experience/etc..
