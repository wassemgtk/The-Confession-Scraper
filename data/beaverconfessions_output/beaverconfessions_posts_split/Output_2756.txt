I know this is a tough time for everybody, but I'm actually really really happy. I fell in love with an amazing guy. We've had our ups and downs (mostly due to my mental issues and insecurity) but he's been so generous and loving and caring. I know love is fucking terrifying and it hurts sometimes, but it's also so worth it. I never thought I'd be able to have this kind of relationship but here I am :) I'm happy.
