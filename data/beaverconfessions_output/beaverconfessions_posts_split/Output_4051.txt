Dear Hairuo Guo, I'm just going to go out and say it. You're really hot and I really want to ravish you. Like a carrot out of the ground, I want to pluck you out and make you mine, so that you can feel it inside. I don't know why I feel this way, because its never happened to me before. Ive been thinking about it for a while and can only come upon on solution: you are a truly singular person and although now you experience this through pain someday that very same pain will be useful to you anything or anyone worth their space was forged through adversity. Your friend "Matt" Perez.
