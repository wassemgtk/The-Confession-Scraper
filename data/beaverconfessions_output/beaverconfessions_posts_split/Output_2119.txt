Person X downloads all of the class notes for an open-note exam. X says that X often looks at exam question, thinks "I've seen that before", then finds the code from the lecture notes, and copies and pastes.

As soon as X said that, Person Y and Z asked X what X was learning by doing that. Even though it's not cheating, as X said, it was a pleasant reminder that MIT students are often in it for the learning and not for the grade.
