@5085 I agree. those apps are well-intentioned but pretty useless except maybe at bringing out conversations on mental health. I feel like we focus so heavily on mental health, we induce people to be sad. I mean if I get mental health messages everywhere, it makes it out to be like everyone's always suffering. In all that doom and gloom, I can't stay too happy. The hyper-focus on mental health makes mental health worse. Yes, we need to have resources, but I don't want that to be the only thing we do here. I mean grow up a bit. The real world is also super stressful, we have to learn to deal with it.
