@2529 you think just because you won a bunch of dance competitions and "got moves" that you're entitled to my body on the dance floor? Women are individuals entitled to their own choices, not robots pre-programmed to dance with whoever thinks they're good at dancing.  You've got no business telling me who I should or shouldn't be dancing with, the only person with the power to decide that is me.  And even if I choose to dance with men of certain races, that's my business and mine alone. 

And this is why we need more feminism in the world.
