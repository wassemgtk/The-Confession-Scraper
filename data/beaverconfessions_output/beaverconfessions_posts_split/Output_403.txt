I miss the old Pset, the 8.01 Pset
the every week Pset, stay up all night Pset
I hate the new Pset, the only one Pset
the always hard Pset, gonna give up Pset
I miss the easy Pset, the really short Pset
I gotta say, at that time I'd like to meet Pset
See I invented Pset, it wasn't any Psets
And now I look and look around and there's so many Psets
I used to love Pset, I used to love Pset
I even had the extension, I thought I was Pset
What if Pset made a song, about Pset?
Called "I Miss The Old Pset," man that would be so Pset
That's all it was Pset, we still love Psets
And I love you like Kanye loves Kanye
