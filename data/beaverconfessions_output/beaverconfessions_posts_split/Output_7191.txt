It is fucking comical how a few people who fall into some sort of minority group think that they're entitled to be unaccepting assholes... and if anyone calls them out on it, they claim that those people can't do that because somehow that indicates a generalization that the whole minority group consists of assholes. Equality is not about going out on a crusade to even out how many wrongs each side has done. Let's take a classic example: just because you're a girl doesn't mean you should treat guys like shit. Just because someone hurt you doesn't mean you get to advocate for the person who looks the most like you because it's "more likely" that they were the one who got hurt. That shit is the reason feminist has devolved into a label I'd rather not have. And that's really, really sad, because so much could be done if we could all calm the fuck down.
