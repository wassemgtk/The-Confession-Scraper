Is it too late to join clubs junior year? Will other upperclassmen judge me for it? I spent my first two years dealing with depression and anxiety, and as a result, I didn't join many clubs and really regret it now. I don't have many close friends in college, as I also lost contact with many acquaintances and general friends during that period. I really don't know how to meet and get to know more people. I feel like people found their set friend groups already, and I don't want/know how to awkwardly try to insert myself into one, but I always feel so lonely at school and don't know what to do about it. I know it's a minor thing, but I've always hated eating alone at the dining hall (which happens a lot), and I feel like such a friendless loser. I've been dreading coming back to school the entire summer. Advice please?
