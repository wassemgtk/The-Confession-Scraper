it's been one of those weeks where i've just had so much work and have not stopped working. now that i've finally gotten to take a small pause, i feel like breaking down. i feel miserable. i dont want to be here. im not even going to be happy or relieved when this week is done because its just been so shitty. i dont want to start working again. i just want to sleep and not feel completely exhausted and not feel guilty about not working.
