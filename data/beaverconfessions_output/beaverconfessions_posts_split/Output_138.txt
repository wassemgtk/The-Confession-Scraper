I was raised being told that letting emotions affect your work was just making excuses for yourself and that I should just suck it up, not think about it, and just fucking sit down and do my work. And I can't help but to feel like anything I need to go to S3'd for is just a plain stupid excuse, and while it isn't to me, while I'm really hurt and stressed, it'll definitely sound like an excuse to whoever listens. And all I can imagine in a conversation with them is someone silently judging me like "look at this kid just finding excuses to get out of a pset, or exam, pathetic, weak, wasteful."
