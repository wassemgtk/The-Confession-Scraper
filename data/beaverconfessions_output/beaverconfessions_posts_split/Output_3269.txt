@5085 Yes, and no. Yes you have to do something to get out of or better manage your mental illness. No, it's not as fucking simple as focus on your work and try harder at school. 

That something that you do to get out might be meds, or keeping a calendar, or keeping alarms on your phone to help stay focused. And it might also be TMAYD, Lean on Me, etc. Those apps aren't helpful to me personally, but I can easily see that for someone who needs it, that might be the first step in reaching out, the first step in getting better and focusing on school. And simply because it does not help me, doesn't mean it's useless.

Because even reaching out on those platforms is doing something, whatever you can in that state to get out. 

Your depression does not encompass everyone's struggles. You do not understand what everyone else is going though, so don't you dare try to minimize it.

You were able to cajole yourself out of it--fine. But people are not weak for seeking help. People are not weak for not being able to bring themselves out of it. I'm not sure why we glorify the whole not seeking help and pushing though on your own. Guys, we're really lucky in that we have so many good people in the community who would like to help. Lean on them, tell them about your day, seek out the help you need so you can focus better on school.
