Hey people, I'm participating in Samaritans 5K walk to raise awareness/prevent suicide. Please help me raise money! Any little amount helps :) https://shar.es/1dkqYP

I'm not particularly trying to be annonmous; I just wanted to reach more people in the MIT community besides the ones I'm friends with on my Facebook. As someone who's been struggling with major depression/suicidal thoughts, this means a lot to me. It will be great and make my day if people can help out with raising money!
