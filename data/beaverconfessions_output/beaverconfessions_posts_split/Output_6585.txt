"Your only way is ignorance, for innocence cannot be granted to the initiated"

Today, I'm just a friend, and I don't mind. Your name's no longer written in the stars; the sweetness of your image, not haunting my mind. I face the world and don't expect your rescue. I look at you and just see you, with qualities and flaws, unbiased. The magic of your smile, your charm, and that angelic look, all gone.
 
Today has come and took away my pain, and those unrealistic hopes, and the exasperation. The day I glorified in expectation, who knew would leave me so alone, uncovered. Forever yours and never yours, deceived for what seems like a second and eternity alike, I mourn today. For what has set me free, has also killed me. The part that loved and could forgive, and see the best in you and me. And all the dreams, and hopes, and expectations. I mourn the wasted time, and pray for butterflies to spread its ashes over Charles. And for a snowfall on a silent winter night, to spread them over us, as both of us are sleeping, not for each other breathing. And letting go of jealousy and hurt, I still mourn you, my angel, bittersweet. The time ephemeral, my love ephemeral, your touch so gentle, and the gaze so loving, either a distant past or mere fantasy as they seem now. A la recherche du blaue Blume, I mourn the metaphysic time and place we could have been together. And I regret, incorrigible romantic, and I can only blame myself for letting the intangible thus slip away... Away from you, away from me, away from us...

RIP the light in your eyes as seen by me, 09/23/2011 - 09/26/2015
