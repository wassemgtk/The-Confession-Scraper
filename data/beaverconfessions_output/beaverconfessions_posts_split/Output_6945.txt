i feel like the 2017 class council work their butts off and do a pretty good job... they get a lot of shit from a very small minority, and sometimes i feel like mit students just find whatever they can to complain about -- mit's hard, for sure, but when two words on a pair of sweatpants gets you worked up about 'class spirit,' you should probably destress elsewhere and go read a book or something.
