I lurk in Senior House. I am among you. I collect evidence, knowledge, and power. I bide my time. I am waiting to call the police on all of the marijuana smoking, acid tripping, drug abusing "edge so sharp you cut yourself" residents of this place.

You may not believe me now, but before I leave, you will feel my wrath. I will be the downfall. I will be a legend. 

Use wisely. Never know who's watching.
