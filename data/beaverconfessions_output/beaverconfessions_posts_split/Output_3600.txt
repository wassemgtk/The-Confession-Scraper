Although I am occasionally overwhelmed during some weeks, I generally do not find my classes hard, and could score an A on all of them. However, I have become a workaholic. I am too obsessed with grades, with the grades and amount of effort others put and I keep comparing. I think of nothing but how to manage my day to get everything done. If I for some reason choose to do something fun, I spend the whole period regretting the wasted time... I have no people with whom I could have strong relationships or friendships. But I wasnt like this. I was a lively person back in my home country. Sometimes I think that when I graduate, I definitely do not want my memories to be solely based on grade perfectionism, and for sure I will not cry then over a B or a C. But I cant help it... I have been scarred for life, in the sense that I can no longer have fun. I wrote this post after I realized how some of my friends were super cool and great, yet I choose to limit any genuine interaction with them, because I never prioritized human interactions.
