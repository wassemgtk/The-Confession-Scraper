Two people just dropped out of MIT to start a "machine intelligence" company on the west coast without a product or even a prototype. I think they're absolutely crazy. How the hell do they think they'll be able to compete with the Googles and Facebooks and Microsofts of the world? Sooner or later it will hit 'em hard, and I'm sure they'll be back on campus with their tails between their legs. #realitycheck
