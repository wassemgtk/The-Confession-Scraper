I have no idea where I would be without the friends I have made here. From the very beginning they all have stood by me regardless of the challenges I would face, and as someone who does not feel particularly close to family and is filled with anxiety and extreme sadness at the thought of home I do not think I would have made it a month without their support. My friends here are my family. I can't picture myself anywhere else even though without them this place would be a living hell. They just mean that much to me I guess
