My relationship with my friends is very asymmetric. I know what their UROPs are on, what classes they're really enjoying this semester, what fields they want to go into after MIT, etc. Things like that.

They've never ever asked me what my UROP is on, or what I want to do after MIT, much less anything else. I'm a senior, and these are my "closest" friends.
