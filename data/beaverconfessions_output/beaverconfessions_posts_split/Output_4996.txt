One thing has really gotten to me about job interviewing. You have to dress up. That bugs me. It's like we finally have a society that allows people to freely express themselves, and some old guy running a company makes us put on these clothes we don't want to wear to pretend that we are excited for a job that we are only doing for money. Like, I can show up to a nice restaurant, court, a wedding, a funeral, or another formally formal event in jeans, a t-shirt, and a beanie. Why can't people move on from the you have to put on a suit for a job or a job interview mode?
