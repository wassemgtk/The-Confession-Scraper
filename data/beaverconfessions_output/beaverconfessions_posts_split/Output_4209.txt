This is what I tell freshmen and anyone who asks for advice on the matter of mental health at MIT: don't go to MIT medical. Go somewhere off campus. If you do go to MIT medical, lie. Don't tell them about anything serious. Never tell them if you do drugs. Never tell them about suicidal (even minor) thoughts, there's a chance they'll purposefully blow it out of proportion and force you to take leave, or deport you to McLean. They will disregard HIPAA, they will violate your rights, they will do everything in their power to force you out and never let you come back, because the institute is a business, and you're a potential liability. They will tell you it's ok, that they care about your well-being, and wouldn't it make you feel better to take some time off? They will lie their heads off to you. It sucks that it has to be this way, but honestly, be safe. They'll fuck you over if they get the chance.
