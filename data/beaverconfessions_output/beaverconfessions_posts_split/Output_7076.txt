I thought it would be easier to get an internship as a junior in course 6, but why is everyone better than me? I got rejected right after the first round of two interviews already and the one I just finished didn't go well at all. And everyone else isn't even responding to my applications. I'm doing pretty well in my classes, but I always mess up during interviews and it seems like there's no room for error. Is anyone else failing as much as I am?
