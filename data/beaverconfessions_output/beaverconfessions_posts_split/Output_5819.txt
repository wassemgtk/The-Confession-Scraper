I honestly don't understand the East/West Campus divide. Why do people hella judge if I say I'm from East Campus? No, I don't really want an influx of people talking about such a divide doesn't exist. Don't say that you don't judge, because you do. You unconsciously assume dyed hair + crazy projects = east side.  We're literally all MIT students - we aren't that different from one another. We all have that geeky streak in us and have that desire to do something that changes the world. Then why can't we do something as simple as treat people of different dorms the same way?
