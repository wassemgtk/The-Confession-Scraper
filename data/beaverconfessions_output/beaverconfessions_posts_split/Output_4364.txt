i wish people would stop posting confessions about senior house. the people who post those things are just going off of the "scary stories" they've heard and blowing it out of proportion. tbh, they probably haven't even come to senior house to see what it's actually like for themselves. no dorm is perfect, but i feel like senior house has just become the goto dorm to make fun of in the past couple of weeks. i really like it here and i'm hurt when i see everyone shitting on my family.
