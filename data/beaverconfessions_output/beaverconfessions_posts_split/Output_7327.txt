I feel like I don't connect well with the people I'm living with, and I feel left out a lot of the time. I've considered switching living groups but I don't really know anyone well outside of my own, so it'd be an awkward transition, not to mention I may go somewhere that I dislike even more than where I am now. I'm not sure what I can do right now to branch out and make friends, besides wait for next year when clubs open up to new members again...
