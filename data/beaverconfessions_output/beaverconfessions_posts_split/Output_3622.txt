I honestly don't think MIT is not THAT much worse than other schools, people here just complain more once they realize they aren't the smartest in their class. We should be thankful for all of the academic resources as well as mental health resources we have. I don't know of many other schools that have something like S^3 to help students get through their time here so stop complaining about how shitty we have it all the time.
