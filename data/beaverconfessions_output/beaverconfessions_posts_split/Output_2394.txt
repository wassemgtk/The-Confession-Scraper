I’m starting to think my best friend doesn’t want to be friends anymore. He never replies remotely soon whenever I offer to hangout, or even when I ask to meet to work on psets or projects that we’re doing for classes. Whenever he does get back to me, he always gives me some reason for disappearing. The longer the absence, the more colorful or extreme the reason. But really I just think he’s ignoring me and watching Netflix with his partner or something. What’s sad is he’s the only person I talk to here. I’m painfully shy, awkward, and unsocial, and he’s the only person I’ve gotten completely comfortable with in my time here. He probably knows this, and only keeps up with me at all out of pity at this point. Why couldn’t I have gone through different experiences…
