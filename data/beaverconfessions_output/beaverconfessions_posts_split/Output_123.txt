I really love the dorm that I'm staying at and I love each and every person in my dorm. You could say that I call them my family. However I just feel like I'm invisible now, that I'm being separated from the very people I call family; that I'm no longer a member of this community, just a stranger that lives in one of the rooms in that dorm and goes about life, not caring about anyone about me but it's far from the truth. I don't want to become a stranger but the ways things are going I doubt that I'll be able to change that, and that's what's scaring me the most, besides grades and stuff.
