I had the best argument to have with people you just met. I was introduced at dinner to a friend of a friend. And this guy went on and on about humans effect on the planet and how every person excreted x kilos of CO2 a day hurting the planet, and how we were pushing earth, making us sound like a disease. So I asked him if he thought most humans were harming the planet by breeding and using resources. He delightedly said yes. I asked him if earth would be better without us. Eagerly, he also said yes. Then I slid him a knife from the other side of the table. I told him, "Since we are all hunks of trash hurting this planet, that includes you, since you are so passionate, lead us by example, by committing suicide right now and saving the planet from your harmful effects". He stammered at me baffled by the thought. I then let him in on the truth. People like him who go on about how humans are so bad for the planet think they are better then everyone else. They want other people to have to make sacrifices, not themselves. Needless to say he left dinner. I can be a little rough with new people.
