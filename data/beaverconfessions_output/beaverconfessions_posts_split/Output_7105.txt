Dear trolls of MIT Confessions,

Sometimes I don't realize how overwhelmed I am until I see one of your posts, and experience the really foreign feeling of grinning ear-to-ear. Trying to remember the last time I laughed really hard at something reminds me that life is too short to let myself get bogged down by all the stresses in my life. 

Thank you for that.
