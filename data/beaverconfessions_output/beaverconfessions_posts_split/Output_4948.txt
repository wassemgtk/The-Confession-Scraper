MIT ideas 2016:
Vanilla city.
White student's union. 
White lives matter (seeing as we are disproportionally killed by people of color).
White politics course.

It's going to be a good year. Time to end the leftist, marxist, multiculturalist bullshit which is ruining our culture and glorious history.
