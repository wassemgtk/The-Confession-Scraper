Can the professors please be understanding of how crucial CPW is for MIT and perhaps let students have it easier for those four days? We students are doing the most important job of advertising and selling MIT to the prefrosh who are coming to visit. I know there's a lot of us who wouldn't be here if we had not came to CPW.
