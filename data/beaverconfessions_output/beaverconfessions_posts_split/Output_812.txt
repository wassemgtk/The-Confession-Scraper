To the person who posted this on 8.044 piazza as soon as the grades for a tough final were released:

"If our overall grade in the class is >= 100%, may we please have an A+ on our grade report? (Of course it makes no difference in GPA, but it just makes one feel happy :)"

YOU ARE AN ASSHOLE.

Sincerely,
Every other student in 8.044
