To #3196, 2.009 has sponsors and that's why it has so much money. 2.009 is the largest class for senior design (I believe, not 100% sure) so it makes sense that it gets attention. David Wallace has made it this big so that some of these products can actually go on and be startups. Additionally, it's up to you to invite people to your capstone presentation. I won't claim 2.009 is harder than any other capstone design class because I know that it's not true. But when it comes to scale of publicity and money it makes sense because of the number of students and sponsors of the class. Wallace has been teaching the class for 20 years, this allowed him to create the relationships necessary to get the sponsors. Also the TA's, professors and course staff put a ton of time and effort into making this spectacle happen. They may sleep even less than most of the students.
