I know that the concept of an SJW has been around for years, but I've only heard about them as of last year. Since then though, they've been flooding my feeds every day and I think they're threatening to actually drive me mad. Ever since I was little I've always been a bit of a contrarian: if someone raises an outspoken opinion, a small voice in my head usually counters with "No they don't!", but for SJW related stuff the voice's been especially loud. At first the contrarian voice was funny and I didn't really pay any attention to it, but after a while I found myself starting to think everything it told me to. This is really bad, since all of the SJW-negated thoughts are pretty unsavory in nature and I always thought of myself as a good person.

Recently the voice's been getting louder and louder and worse and worse: sometimes if I read/watch an especially strongly worded essay/video I get a pretty bad headache and need to clutch at my head for a bit as the voice goes to town on my sensibilities. At this point it's kind of obvious something is wrong so I'm trying to block out all of the SJW posts from my Facebook feed (which is really hard since I like to read every last bit of garbage on the internet, and Facebook thinks I like looking at that stuff), but for every one I block out another one pops up. I also considered abstaining from Facebook (my main source of interaction with the outside world) entirely but I still need it for schoolwork and occasional collaboration.

tl;dr initially it was a joke that SJWs were ruining my life but it seems like it's actually coming true and I think I'm turning into a bad person because of it. I'm not sure if this makes sense but maybe my brain's already jumped the cliff and I've already gone mad: I have a PSet due in a couple of hours and tons of other things due shortly afterwards that I didn't start and I'm still thinking that the SJWs are out to get me.

What should I do?
