I went to a furry convention last year. It was an awesome place with super nice people, people showing their art, and people hosting some panels that went from both fun to really serious (From improv to talks on depression, harassment, etc.).  Everyone there was super welcoming, it was a mostly PG atmosphere, and in total the convention raised thousands of dollars for some local charities. (MA Vest a Dog)

Even with all that, I still worry about my friends finding out.  I know it's MIT and we're all accepting, but too many people get the wrong idea about the furry fandom without actually talking to anyone they know from the group.  (It's not just a group for sexual deviants, normal people are part of it as well.)

But in the meantime, that convention was awesome, and I'm going again.  Maybe this time I'll be honest with my friends about where I'm going. Who knows?
