I've made so many incredible friends for life here at MIT. but there is one friend...and I cherish him more than he will really ever notice, whenever we hang out he just puts me at ease and I feel like we connect on a million different levels and I have this awful feeling that I'm falling for him. Which is rather unfortunate for me because he's gay, but if he weren't I think we'd make the perfect couple, is it wrong that I feel like this? Maybe I should bury my feelings til we graduate soon...
