To the people that lost their minds on confession #4916, it was a fucking joke! Calm the fuck down! 

To the people that realized it was just a joke and laughed, thank you for not being a bunch of easily butt-hurt whiners. 

It's ridiculous that more you flipped out over something like this than some of the posts on this page that were actually racist. 

No, I'm not a bitter student that failed 7.01x (I actually got an A in that shitty class), I just posted this because a couple of friends and I were joking about this and I was bored over spring break. Even though I do think that biology is very much the shittiest of the sciences in terms of actually being a science, that does not mean that I have no respect for the people who enjoy it or study it. 

Learn to take a fucking joke. 

You people make me exhausted. Good night.
