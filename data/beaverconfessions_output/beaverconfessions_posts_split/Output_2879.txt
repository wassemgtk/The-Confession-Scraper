@5478 I feel like I could have written this myself. What keeps me going is the belief that things will improve with time. I don't know how long you have been in therapy, but it can take a while to help, it certainly did for me. it has made things better for me though, especially as far as trauma is concerned. I also think that people our age tend to be very self involved and that over time people will mature and will be more supportive friends. And sometimes I tell myself these things, but I can't believe them. At those moments I choose to live because I am too angry at the people who have hurt me to let them extinguish my existence. I will not give them that power. Instead, I choose to demand that the world accommodate my existence even if it would clearly rather not.
