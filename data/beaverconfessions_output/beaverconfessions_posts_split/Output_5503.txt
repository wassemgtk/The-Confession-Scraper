I'm really tired of the fat shaming of men I see in the media. All around I see all these guys with abs, big bulging biceps, quads, and huge chests. These are not accurate images of real men! I think we need to redefine what it means to be a beautiful man. I want to see calvin clein ads with men with a big proud stomach, jean ads with the guys crack sticking out, and ads with no unhealthy abdominal definition or full chest muscles. These give men unhealthy body images and convince young boys to eat too little and lift too many weights.
