I think we should be updating the good samaritan policy to treat drugs and alcohol the same, in that we punish students for both. we're at one of the best schools in the world and people need to be taking that more seriously, not getting high or wasted all the time. So we should be punishing people who drink as well as who do drugs. It's unbecoming of people to drink to blackout or anywhere near it, and we have a duty to report others who do it as well as police ourselves. I don't get why nobody understands this, especially in the greek system. I find it abhorrent that my sisters think it's ok to get wasted on the weekends, and that we let in people who clearly party too much. Sororities are supposed to be about improving us as people, not drinking, doing drugs and partying.
