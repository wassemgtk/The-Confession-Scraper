To MIT greek people:  I'm an affiliated guy, and it really bothers me that my brothers and a lot of fraternities shit on PBE so much during/after this weekend. If they showed the prefrosh a good time, that's going to get them more excited about MIT. If guys want to join their fraternity because of how good of a time they had there, then that's their decision. Everyone wants to be in a fraternity they can enjoy and be proud of. I know a lot of us "dislike" their CPW shirts, but I have had conversations with guys in a couple fraternities (LCA and Phi Sig specifically) and we agreed it's only because they are better than our own. We all joined greek life for some reason, and all greek life improves this school. There's no reason to shit on each other. To guys in PBE, congrats on a very exciting CPW weekend. You have shown us all how powerful of a presence you can become over just one weekend.
