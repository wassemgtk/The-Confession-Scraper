If you ever wonder why I friended you on Facebook without knowing you that well, then this post may help you understand why. It is mainly because I'm interested in knowing you better. You seem really nice but I don't understand why I'm scared to talk to you. This is especially true when you're around the same group of friends that you seem to always hang out with. And if I seem aloof or ignoring you, it is because I have not found a valid reason to talk to you without appearing blatantly interested in you. Next time, I'll make sure to say hi. Or you can save me the effort and say hi or something.
