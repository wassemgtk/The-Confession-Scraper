Dear fellow 18.03 students, 

Stop mocking Prof. Jonathan Kelner. He's a great teacher and a great guy and you know it. He really cares about us and that he does a good job. Furthermore, he goes through with it and does so. Stop laughing at him because of his quirky behavior. Deep down at the bottom of your heart, you enjoy his jokes and genuinely smile when he says something humorous or positive. Looking down on someone who might be slightly "awkward" at times doesn't make you cool and your continuous chattering while his back is turned is not appreciated. There are many in the room who are trying to do well on the course and are gaining a lot from the lectures. 

Thank you.
