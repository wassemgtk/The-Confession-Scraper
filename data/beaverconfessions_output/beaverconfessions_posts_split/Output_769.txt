I honestly thought finals week would be more do-able than it is. This stuff is hard. Even though I'm really struggling to finish my freshman classes and GIRs, I just want to say that this shit isn't making me doubt my capabilities. I've just grown to find more genuine respect and awe at the amount of pure brightness there is in every student here, and the fact that we are all passing our classes is an insane achievement. No other school can compare to the amount of work MIT pushes us to do, and no one will ever understand the extent to which we drive ourselves. You all are amazing, brilliant, and inspiring. I wish you all the luck you'll ever need.
