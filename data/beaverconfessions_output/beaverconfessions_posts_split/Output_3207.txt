There's one question I keep getting asked a lot that I want to answer. I don't attempt to hide the fact that I am against birth control. Most people look at me shocked when I answer and ask how is that possible? It's very safe and effective. Physically yes, but there's more to it. The main reason I am against it is its psychological effects. When people are able to no longer worry about producing children from sex they seek pleasure as oppose to a partner who is actually good for them in a relationship. Do you think it's some coincidence that divorce and birth control use rose together in the 20th century in lock step? This in turn leads to widespread family breakdown which is statistically proven to lead to children who are more likely to live in poverty and do prison time. In short, it makes for a selfish population that thinks little for those around them, and only for themselves. For those of you who will angrily respond to this that it's none of my business what pleasure you seek and from whom, ask yourself should you be doing it? Sometimes doing the right thing means giving up what we want and doing what's right for everyone else.
