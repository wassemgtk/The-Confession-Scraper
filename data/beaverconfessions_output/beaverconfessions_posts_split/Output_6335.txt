I thought when I came to MIT everyone would be smart and would therefore understand and discredit  the "keep spending and it'll get better" liberal philosophy. Boy was I wrong. Instead almost everyone I meet is an Ã¼ber liberal. Scary...

People don't seem to value hard work anymore. They either believe that working hard should lead to unconditional success, or they believe that one shouldn't have to work hard to get a fair lot in life. This page is a great example. Everyone is whining about work and stress and homework and problem sets and classes that no one is forcing you to attend. Go get a job at the 7/11 down the street if you think it sucks so much.

You don't deserve anything intrinsically, except maybe the right to exist.
