I get really angry when I hear upperclassmen tell frosh that they shouldn't try in their classes because grades don't matter. This is a time where they should be figuring out how to work, and P/NR gives a safety net , not an excuse to punt. Maybe instead of criticizing frosh for being worried about the classes that seem easy to us (but are hard to them!), we should be encouraging them to work efficiently and learn the material.
