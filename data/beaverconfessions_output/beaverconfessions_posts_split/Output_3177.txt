I'm a senior who moved to EC this year and it's pretty nice. I lived in Simmons my freshman year and wasn't feeling that. Lived off campus and then decided to move back to campus. EC has been my favorite dorm by far (I've unofficially lived aka psetted a bunch in other west campus dorms and Senior House).  There's a pretty strong culture and it's an old building, but everyone is really respectful and generally welcoming. I really haven't had any problems. I just wish I had moved here earlier so I could have enjoyed it more. 

When I see the confessions bashing EC I feel sorry that those people feel so upset about EC.  I hope they find a place that works for them. But they should realize that EC doesn't suck, it's just not the place for them.  Just like Simmons doesn't suck, it just wasn't the place for me.
