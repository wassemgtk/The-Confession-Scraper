How is it that there are classes where you understand all the topics, you put in all the necessary time to do all the psets, you study hard and in advance for the exams, you know you're a good student because you've been doing well in your other classes at MIT for the past few years, but somehow you find yourself on the borderline of FAILING a class. I understand that if I don't do well on the tests, I should get a C. Sure, maybe even a D.  I could still graduate with one D. But borderline failing the class?  MIT, please just let me graduate in peace.  If I fail this class, I don't think I'll even be able to do better if I have to retake this class.
