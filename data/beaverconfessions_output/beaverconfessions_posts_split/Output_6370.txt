There was someone below who posted that he isn't sure if global warming is real or not. To you I say you are asking the wrong question. It no longer matters if global warming is real or not. Everyone thinks its real. I admittedly am not sure myself. But I no longer bother to even ask. If people believe it to be true, they will act in a manner of prevention, so long as they have to make little or no personal sacrifice along the way. So ask yourself, how can I use this to my advantage?
