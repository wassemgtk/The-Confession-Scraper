@MIT Chorallaries... I'm sorry if the last post seemed sharp and offensive... I promise it wasn't meant to be a hate post. All of your singers are quite talented, and I just wanted to offer blunt critique from one singer to another so you could improve...I've been to all your concerts and I just felt like someone should give you a head's up, but I couldn't find your email and MIT Confessions is quite an effective way to get people's attention... Plus tempo/syncing is so easily fixed once you know, and I'm sure you'll get on it... And yes, "Say You Love Me" is a lot better :)
