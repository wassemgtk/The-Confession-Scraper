I am honestly disgusted by the 2017 class council. One of your two suggested themes for the Junior Formal is "Oscars". Do you really want to support an institution that snubs wonderful actors of color in favor of mediocre white ones? An institution that nominates way more men than women in categories that aren't restricted by gender, even though there are plenty of qualified women? I don't see how you can offer that suggestion with a straight face.
