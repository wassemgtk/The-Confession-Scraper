All of my friends have been hooking up and having relationships, and I feel like a piece of shit not being able to. I feel like it may be because I did not have a proper partying culture back home, or because I'm ugly as fuck, but either way, what are some tips on "the game"? I'm dead serious, please help a fellow thirsty beaver out and hit me up with tips at icannotgetlaid@gmail.com. Thanks y'all
