confession of mine: Some people say that they find it intimidating to be here. With all the expectations on their shoulders and with an environment of brilliant people, how is it possible for ordinary people like them to cope, they wonder. I guess I consider myself an ordinary guy here too I guess. But instead of intimidating me, this environment inspires me.

There are so many wonderful people I met and wonderful examples I could choose from, but I'll talk about that freshman who never got the chance to start the school year with the rest of us yet. Theo. If you don't know what happened to him check this out http://swimswam.com/support-team-theo-everpresent-tiburon-mile/ I wish you all the best, and hope for your safe recovery, even though I never got to meet you before! All the best, and when you get here, I hope I get the chance to meet you!
