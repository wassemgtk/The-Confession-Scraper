@5247 OP, "it's good for the children" has been the excused used to force women into shitty conditions for centuries.
"The children need their mother at home, you shouldn't be working"
"You'll be a housewife one day, so college isn't worth it" (unless it's an MRS degree)
"It's totally inappropriate for a married woman to work. Don't make your husband ashamed of his income"

To clarify for you, OP, divorce rates and birth control rose together because it was finally recognized that women have value beyond popping out babies and cooking assholes like yourself dinner. Birth control let women say "no, I'm not having (more) kids, I'm having a career."

Although, OP, if you're concerned about divorce, I'd suggest dropping out of college, convincing everyone in your life divorce is a mortal sin, and becoming fully economically dependent on your spouse. Then, no matter how poorly he/she treats you, I can guarantee you'll be less likely to file for divorce.

As a final note, have you ever noticed how low the divorce rate is in countries with honor killings?
