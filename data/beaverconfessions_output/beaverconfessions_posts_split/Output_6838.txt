I am so upset with the fact that the 2016 rings have frat symbols. It is so unfair, not only do frats and sororities want to determine the ring committee, but now they even want to put their symbols on our brass rat. I honestly believe that they should reimburse us in some way. The ring that I am so proud to wear is the hack of a fraternity, how disappointing.
