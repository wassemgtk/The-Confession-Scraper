Tbh, I do really feel that the Moving Day celebration just meant to make my heart broke because after all those amazing feelings and excitements, I cannot continue to cherish it inside my mind and heart because of the finals. Like, I'm heartbroken. Like, I have just broken up with my boyfriend... yeah, literally heartbroken... is it weird? :/
