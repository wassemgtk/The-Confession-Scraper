Honestly it's pretty eerie to hear about the racism MIT has.
As a junior this place has been getting consecutively worse.
And I'm not saying that as some jaded upperclassman.
Even before I got to MIT Bexley was already being demolished.
Another community destroyed.

Then my freshman year the whole Phi Sig incident effectively killed the social scene here. Every Friday and Saturday there were tons of people having fun and making memories. You can still do that-anywhere. But MIT was known literally all over the United States for its parties and now they're nothing compared to before.
(Don't believe me ask an alumni)

Meanwhile in the dorms, the security issue has made everyone less comfortable in their own dorms. For some reason MIT administration is pretending that outsourcing the job made security instantly better than their own in-house security.
And in case that didn't work then now everyone has to swipe their cards and now they are guests list. Guys, let's not pretend that a guest list is going to stop someone intent on seriously hurting someone. All it does is make us less comfortable in our own homes or rather "homes" now.

And for the students themselves I've seen a re-occurring trend of students studying their major only for a job. Not a job they like. Not a job they don't mind doing. I mean people spending 4 years here studying skmething they don't even like to a get job they don't even want. 
Then on the other side of the spectrum you have students who have such tunnel vision that they don't even care about the world. They're fine developing robotics and AI without considering the real world consequences of doing such a world characterized by Big Brother levels of surveillance and Hyper-Corporatism that exploits human beings against one another in the job market for profit. 

Those people may not understand just how serious the gravity of this situation is 
But all I can say...the Harvard bridge is falling down.
