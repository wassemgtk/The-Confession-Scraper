I feel like I woke up in a cyberpunk dystopia, but with only the oppressive governments and corporations and without the schway tech and aesthetic. Kinda depressing tbh.

There's a certain aesthetic to 80's futurism that appeals to our demographic. I can't quite explain it. 

Our current culture is a combination of the worst of the 60's and 90's. I think our overall preferred aesthetic is more like the best or the 40's and 80's, a sort of clean sleekness from the former decade with some of the technical superiority and edge from the latter. It's why music aesthetics like vaporwave and genres like Synthwave (Carpenter Brut, Perturbator) seem to be popular amongst the "Alt-right" as they call them, the music can be smooth and streamlined, while still packing a punch. I would be willing to bet that a counterculture using a new aesthetic that has sharp definition as a centerpiece would overtake the formless, shapeless aesthetics of today. 

80s was the last decade when we had a high energy, forward looking culture.

90s began modern low-energy pessimism.

Time to re-load our last good save.
