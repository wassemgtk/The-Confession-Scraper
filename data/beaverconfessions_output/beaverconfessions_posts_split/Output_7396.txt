white privilege, critical race theory and all the RACIST garbage like it, is meant to assign collective guilt and personal responsibility to all white people for the crime of being white in their own countries, cultures and societies. it becomes especially important a fiction when black racists have so little to actually point to.

it turns the reality of being a minority in a white society into instant victimization. this is racism that non-whites can enjoy, this is something created and scripted by WHITE LIBERALS first and foremost.

its no accident that the solution for "white privilege" just so happens to be white liberal ideology... its no accident that black racists are blind to their own indoctrination and servility.

affirmative action, entitlement programs and the like... the ONLY institutionalized racism that actually does exist, becomes the means in which black support is guaranteed. racism under the guise of "social justice"

there is no Asian privilege in predominantly Asian countries.

there is no mestizo privilege in predominantly mestizo countries.

there is no black privilege in predominantly black countries.

anything, but ANYTHING you can attempt to describe as white privilege is seen and repeated in ALL non-white societies. but the very concept itself IS ONLY APPLIED to predominantly white countries, cultures and societies. being white makes you GUILTY. simply existing makes you GUILTY.

it is purely RACIST.

again.. it exists to ASSIGN COLLECTIVE GUILT on people who have harmed no one, who have committed no crime. it is used to justify collective responsibility on people simply for existing. its meant to provide JUSTIFICATION for racist policies and attitudes AGAINST THEM.

all of it, hinges on the idea that there is no such thing as white culture, communities, societies. that white people "take for granted" that they can walk out the door, go to work, the store, a club and expect to see people who like like themselves.

this is what white people "take for granted".... white people walk out the door and "should" expect to see black, asians, mestizos, arabs ...every race and creed. the very idea that white people expect to live in their own racial society, culture, and community makes them GUILTY of something.
