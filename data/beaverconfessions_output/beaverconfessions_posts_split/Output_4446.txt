Black lives matter taught me that black lives only matter when a white person takes them. It also awakened me to the anti-white agenda of "diversity" and minority groups. It also awakened me to the fact that modern leftist activism is more concerned with censorship than actually backing up anything they're saying. Thanks BLM, you changed my life for the better.
