I'm from Argentina. I'm studying here and so far have had a good experience. I did have one request that I think merits this. I was asked by someone representing a certain group who I will not name because I sincerely hope he doesn't represent all of them if I would show up and talk about my "diversity". I wrongly assumed he meant foreign at first. I asked what he meant and he said, "person of color". I'm white and pointed this out, he responded, "oh you're Hispanic". Yeah, and he's probably Irish, so what? I have an accent and dark hair, but let me educate everyone here about Central and South America for a moment. First of all, most South Americans are white by American standards. Most of Argentina and Brazil, the big ones down there, are made up of western European immigrants like the US. Most other people are a mix of western European and various Indian tribes that no longer exist on their own. There are also a handful of Indian tribes, and a decent number of black ones that are the descends of former slaves. Second, most countries down there have fairly decent living standards, so it's not a place that leaves too much dirt poverty. And finally most US ideas of Latino come from interaction with poor Mexican immigrants who do not represent the culture, accents, or experiences of most south and central American nations. Some people here want to group everyone who speaks Spanish as one people. We are far from it. What I ask is instead of hearing how someone speaks and deciding you know their life story, listen first.
