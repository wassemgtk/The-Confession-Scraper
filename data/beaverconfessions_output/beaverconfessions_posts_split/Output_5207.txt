lol if someone says that they're having a miserable time here and you aren't, then don't use your time to invalidate someone else's misery and try try to understand why your happiness isn't the general experience here, and if you care enough to start a argument with or otherwise harass someone who's going through a rough time then maybe direct that care towards positive change.

when you're stressed out and depressed, the worst thing is when people say you don't deserve to feel that way. everyone gets through this place differently and invalidating others' feelings doesn't help anyone.
