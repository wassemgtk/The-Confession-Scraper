To the one who suggested having a hack-a-thon to fix our screwed up bus system, I must respectfully disagree. True, it's good to get students involved with this overlooked issue, and sure it would probably be pretty fun; however, fixing the bus/safe-ride system is clearly an administrative responsibility. Though students should obviously give input, dumping this problem on students and allowing administration to continue ignoring these absurdly obvious issues that students generally agree upon is pretty messed up.
