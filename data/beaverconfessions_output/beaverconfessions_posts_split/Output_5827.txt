I had a rough argument with a guy at a party. He went on and on about how systematic racism was so bad for him. I pointed out that he got into MIT so this systematic racism clearly failed on him. He went on about how white power structures caused it and I asked if as a white man that made me responsible. He said no but, "it's the duty of white people to help dismantle the structures". I pointed out that this was just another way of saying white guilt and he started getting angry. I then pointed out that if it is my duty to dismantle the structures and he can't succeed with them in place, then it was my duty to help him. I pulled out my wallet and offered him a 20 dollar bill smirking at him, saying he clearly needed it, and it was my duty to give him what I could as his oppressor, to succeed in my evil white world. He smacked my hand away screaming in rage that I was part of the problem and he didn't need my help. I gave him a choice, admit that he was powerless due to structural racism and needed my charity, or that there is no structural racism, and that he uses it to cover up his own personal failures. He choose to storm out of the house screaming that I was a racist in his eyes. I pointed out on his way out, that he was judging an entire race based on a few individuals and that he was the true racist.
