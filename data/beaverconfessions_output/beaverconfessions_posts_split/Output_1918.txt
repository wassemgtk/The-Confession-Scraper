I've dated the four main races on campus: Asians, Whites, Blacks and Latinos. All those races have thier fair share of beautiful women on campus but Blacks and Latinos are on another level. They're so sexual and so unbelivable. They're also so similar. When i dated a black chick, it was like dating a latino chick and vice versa. Keep on doing what you do. You're awesome, ladies of color.
