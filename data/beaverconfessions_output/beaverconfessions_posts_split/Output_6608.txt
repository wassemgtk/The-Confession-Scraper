The HackMIT staff is part of the reason that I want to avoid tech. It was approximately a bunch of start-up types in bro hats embodying basically every negative thing I've read about brogrammers.
They were also more rude than average. I was sick the morning of registration, came late, and instead of being talked to like a reasonable adult, I was told "If you really wanted to hack you would have showed up on time" and sent away.
