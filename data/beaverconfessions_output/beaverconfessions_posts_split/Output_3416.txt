I'm pretty fucking tired of everyone sucking the 6.046 TAs' dicks on Piazza. They're not fucking philanthropists; being a TA is their fucking job, and it should be ok to call them out if they're shitty at their jobs. They don't need a fucking pat on the back for struggling to handle pset-writing for a popular algorithms class that has existed for like 20 years.
