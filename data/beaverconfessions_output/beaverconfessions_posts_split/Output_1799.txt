There is a definite pressure to be well-liked at MIT. Some students are just more popular and they get more praise than people like me. For example, many times when I walk into a room with my closest friends, I get a couple quiet "hi"s or something mundane like that. However when [someone else] is approaching on his unicycle from across the hall, everybody in the room gets the FUCK up and shouts "here come dat boi!!!!" 

oh shit waddup
