If you really think that dressing up as an native american is offensive and/or morally wrong, you are the kind of person that makes me ashamed to call myself a liberal. When people dress up as a native american for Halloween, they don't do it to be offensive or to pay homage. They do it because it's freaking Halloween. You might as well say that it's wrong for white people to wear dreadlocks or use chopsticks.
