To the black girl living next to me who just chewed me out for being 'racially insensitive' and refusing to acknowledge 'racist undertones in science dominated by old white people' while I was talking about my pset: 

Yep we have super deep racial problems in our society, and yep 19th century europe scientists were probably super racist. But nope, still pretty sure "blackbody" has exactly zero racial implications.
