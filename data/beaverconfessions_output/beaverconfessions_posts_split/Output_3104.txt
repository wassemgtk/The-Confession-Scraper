In response to the confession about feeling proud when you were buying a tampon while someone else was buying a pregnancy test...

I get that your confession was probably a joke but it reminded me of the time I had to buy a pregnancy test my freshman year.  (I'm a senior now for context and have only had sex with my then and current boyfriend.)  I was on the pill and those mess up your period really badly.  I knew this but I never suspected how badly my period would get messed up.  I missed my period for 4 months and I tried to remain calm at month 1, 2 and 3 but at month 4 I definitely flipped out.  I took a pregnancy test the last day before I left for the summer and my boyfriend and I discussed options before (i.e. whether I would have an abortion or not - I had to face the fact that I would probably get an abortion, which was a really painful realization for me).  I went off-campus to Shaw's because I was worried (apparently justifiably) about someone recognizing me and judging me for it.  I bought the test and a random magazine.  I threw the magazine on top of the test (which was stupid in retrospect - the cashier still saw the test when she scanned it and that trip cost more than it needed to).  I also refused to let my boyfriend stand with me in line.  It would look odd if we were standing in line next to each other buying a test.  I don't know man - it would just feel weird.  I immediately took the test in the bathroom while my boyfriend waited outside.  It came out negative.  I have since switched forms of birth control (for a few other reasons as well).  Condoms all the way for me!!!

But that was a stressful situation and it was made 10 times worse by the shame of the situation.  There is so much shame.  Hence my anonymity.  Anyway, just a random story I realized that I have never shared.  Not even with my best friend.
