i don't judge the east side kids for their dyed hair or bondage parties, like do whatever, but in return I ask that you not judge me. I might like wearing nice dresses to frat parties. I might be straight. I might *gasp* want to try at mainstream classes and shit. Don't tell me I'm not worth as much as you because I don't spend time building giant wooden structures.
