Learning that your now w/ some other chick burns my heart. You think that I m a bitch for being distant to you but its bc i become too shy and awkward around you. Im usually confident around guys but seeing myself foolish around you really pisses me off. I've always thought that i won't fall for someone but I'm very attracted to you. Now I don't even know how to reach out to you and letting go of you without even knowing each other further is painful.
