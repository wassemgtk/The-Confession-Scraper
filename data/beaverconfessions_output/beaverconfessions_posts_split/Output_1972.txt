When you email a professor asking for clarification about a deadline or something and after their answer they put some bullshit like "which you would know if you had come to the last lecture."

It's like, well guess what? I wasn't fucking at the last lecture, it's none of your business why I wasn't at the last lecture, there's no way at this point that I can make myself have been at the last lecture, and that's why I'm asking you this question now. So how about you just answer it and keep the snarky comments to yourself you goddamn prick? 

And did you ever consider that maybe one of the reasons I wasn't at the last lecture is because you're the annoying kind of person who would do some bullshit like say "which you would know if you had come to the last lecture" when I'm asking you to clear up confusion caused by a mistake you made?
