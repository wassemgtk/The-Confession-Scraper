I think people need to calm the hell down about dorms being knocked down or renovated.... You do realize dorm culture will naturally change over time? You do realize dorm culture isn't everything? You do realize people are paying thousands to live in unsafe environments? You do realize MIT is just going to knock down all the dorms and put up permanents tents instead????
