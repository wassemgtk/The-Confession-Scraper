STOP COMPLAINING ABOUT EVERYTHING.... All the students on the class councils, UA event committee, senior week, senior ball, and senior gift committees are volunteering their time and work to make these events happen. If you want the events run in your way, why don't you join the committee in the first place? 
We as a community should appreciate each other more. Do not make people feel shit. Hiding behind your laptop and posting a confession saying these people suck do not make you a hero.
