Is anyone else amused by the fact that the GOP's rhetoric for much of this campaign season has focused on how Hillary would be the worst thing to happen to the US and yet the final 2 (serious) contenders for the Republican nomination are quite possibly the 2 most hated people in the party and the final nominee is probably the worst thing that has ever happened to the GOP?
