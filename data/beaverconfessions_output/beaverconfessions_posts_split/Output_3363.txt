Tbh I actually kinda like living in Maseeh. People say that no one should like Maseeh because there's no culture. That's not true. It might not be a cult like other places on campus, and the communities might be smaller, but it's not like everyone only lives in Maseeh and psets nowhere in Maseeh.

Now if only Maseeh dining weren't the biggest contributor of (bacterial) culture, perhaps I'd be just a little happier.
