I need advice.
I spent freshman year not making any friends, and just working on my classes. I basically only took classes in my major. At least what I thought was my major... Now I've decided I want to change!
But I don't have any friends or social life, I've wasted a year taking classes that don't count towards my degree, and I actually don't know what to major in (3 or 4 options...). 

Advice, please?
