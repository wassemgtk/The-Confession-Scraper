I really wish that 5613 was about me, but I doubt anyone would describe me as ambitious.  Anyways, if this person that you are writing about feels anything similar to how I feel then he'll be glad to hear about your situation.  People deal with their emotions in different ways and I think we are at an age now where it is important to understand that just because you like someone doesn't mean that being together is the right thing given the situation
