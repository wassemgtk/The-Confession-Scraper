I often feel super inadequate and generally average (like invisible average). I've never felt like I'm remarkable...just an average Joe that is pretty unnoticeable (personality wise and physically). I just want to feel like I matter :/ . I know there are people who love me and care about me, but I can't shake the feeling that I'm not much to rave about :( . Wish I was one of those people who was more self confident...it's pretty ironic as well that most people think I'm pretty self satisfied.
