I really did not think that college students would still act like high schoolers when it comes to being with friends.  I mean, if you don't like someone then that's one thing, and if you have a certain group of people you usually do stuff with, then good for you.  But if you have a friend that wants to hang out with your click or whatever, then why is that friend all of a sudden cast in the shadows as if he/she isn't even there?

It really doesn't make sense, especially if you are very familiar with everyone in the friend group.  Personally, I'm really struggling with the fact that I am being marginalized by people that I've gotten to know since September, and it really makes me sad knowing that I can't hang around these people without always feeling like a stranger to them.  Yes, I could hang out with other people, and that's what I've been doing nowadays.  The problem is, I see these people just about everyday, and that always reminds me that for some unknown reason, I can't interact with them the way I used to.  

If they don't want to be friends, it would be nice to know so that this problem doesn't continue to weigh on me.  And if they do want to be friends, well it would be nice if they could start treating me like one.
