What if I was wrong to come here? I don't think I can to look my parents in the eye and tell them I need to take an extra year to finish college because I spent my time lying around feeling sad and being lazy instead of working and learning. What if I never can figure out how to be happy again? I don't even know how much of it had to do with MIT in the first place. Why is everyone else able to figure their shit out?
