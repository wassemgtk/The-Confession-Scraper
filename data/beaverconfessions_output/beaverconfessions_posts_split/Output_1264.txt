I have this constant problem whereby when I fall in love with a chick she becomes the centre of my world. I become crazy and obsessed about her. Such stuff isn't attractive so I always end up losing the girl. I've done this multiple times. This time, it really hurt because I really tried to not do that. Unfortunnately, I know that she doesn't love me and never will. She's always flirting with other guys around me and she recently went on a date with one of the guys she's eyeing. I wanted to tell her how I feel but I know it'll just complicate things. I need help to stop this cycle because I'm heartbroken as fuck. It fucking hurts.
