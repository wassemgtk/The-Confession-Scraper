I think I'm having a mid-college crisis. like do I really want to be course 6? do I have the guts to be a HASS major instead and apply to law school with no fall back? should I transfer schools? drop out and start a small business? lol @ all these 2017's telling me I still have a year, I think my "I have no idea what I'm doing with my life" goes a little deeper than most of theirs
