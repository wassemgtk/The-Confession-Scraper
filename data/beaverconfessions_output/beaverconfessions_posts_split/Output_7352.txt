I'm a little frustrated when people say it's about studying smarter... It's nothing personal - it's just that I'm doing everything I need to to maximize the material I learn when I am in study mode. I think the problem is me - I've always been the kind of student who needs to repeat a problem -10 extra times before I get it. I was the slowest student in my high school AP classes and I feel like I'm still the slowest student here. It's disheartening to watch all your other friends understand it the first or second time around, but it's something I've grown to accept. Also, seeing reactions or patterns in my classes isn't intuitive to me as professors often say. Perhaps, I do understand the reactions/patterns/math/etc.; I'll feel proud of myself, and I'll feel confident about taking that test. But if that professor places it on the test with an extra (by extra I mean huge) twist, you can bet your dog biscuits I will not see it - I'll try to, but I won't think of it there on the spot. 
It's not ignorance. 
It's not laziness. 
It's not about studying smart - I'm sure that benefits a lot of other people. 
No, I know the problem is me and that's alright.
