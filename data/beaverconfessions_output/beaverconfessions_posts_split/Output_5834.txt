People keep saying that it's okay and not racist to have a sexual preference of a certain race. Although sexual preferences are genuine feelings that seem instinctual, there is also a reason that you are more attracted to certain features than others, and from a evolutionarily standpoint people of every race have "attractive" features, so it's reasonable to ask why you find a certain race more attractive than others - and it's generally because you associate certain qualities with that race, even if it is subconscious. If you use "preference" as an end-all be-all, there are people who "prefer" underage children, which is obviously not acceptable.
