I had no clue that there was a party this Saturday. I went to stud and got confused to see that giant tent. Then someone told me that it's Moving Day party. I had to finish my last pset that day. I am glad that many of you enjoyed the party. But if you missed the party for work or pset...you're not alone. IHTFP (and MIT is definitely not paradise)
