A finals pep talk: I think both students and teachers are guilty of forgetting the bottom line. We are here to learn things and improve as engineers, scientists, and people. It is a teacher's job to help make these goals attainable for every single student in the class. The point is not for tests and projects to be mindless hurdles to separate "A students" from "B students." Do not for get how brilliant you are and the amazing things you have achieved. If you are trying your hardest and not understanding a a subject, you are not failing the class--the class failed you. The only way to beat the system is to learn everything you can for the sake of learning and use your knowledge to do wonderful things :)
