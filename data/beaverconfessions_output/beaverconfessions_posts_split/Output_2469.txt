I've realized during my few years here that if there's one thing that binds all of us MIT kids together, it's our drive to work our asses off. Whether it's working at a startup, taking shittons of classes, or being involved in a ton of organizations, I don't know anyone who does not actually work his/her ass off. And I think that is an incredible aspect of our school. If I wanted to go somewhere at which people don't give a shit about what they do, and their attitude is "Whatever, I just want to hang out with random people all the time," I would not have come here. My love for MIT stems from the dedication and passion that I see all around me, so it's okay that people ARE focused on their work here above other things. I don't see it as a problem, only something I appreciate.
