It was late at night. The infinite was empty AF. I decided to be a wise guy and do an Usain Bolt, and tried to sprint the ~250 m distance in ~30 seconds. Now I'm about 150 m into the run and I'm feeling fucking great, and even flash a broad smile sideways to imaginary cameras. Then suddenly, out of nowhere, a grad student appears out of Building 4 carrying a tray of samples, and I crash into him, samples flying in every direction and all, and shattering what I think was 5 years worth of his Ph.D. work. Thankfully he was chill, no big deal and all. But me. FML.
