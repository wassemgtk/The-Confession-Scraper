@5197 You sound so much like how I used to be that I thought I accidentally posted this or something. Back then, I ranted to someone and they told me that maybe I was caring about others with the expectation that I'll get the same thing in return. I interpreted it as: you're only nice to them so they'll be nice to you. Naturally, I got really offended and angry at them. It's normal to expect someone you care about to care about you equally. And it's hurtful when you realize they don't. But I thought about what they said after a while and realized they were right in some ways. If I noticed that someone didn't treat me like how I treated them, I would pretty much cut them out because I thought they weren't worth my time. But then I also realized that I didn't want to be someone like that: someone who only fosters relationships to get something back. I don't think I ever really changed anything, but after realizing that I had some relationship issues, I've been a lot happier with my friends. I like myself a lot more too.
