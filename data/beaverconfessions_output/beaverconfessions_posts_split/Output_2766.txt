Is it bad that I think everyone on my hall's tastes are entry-level garbage? When we talk about anime, I can hardly relate to them when they fanboy about old Naruto dubs or how much they loOOOoved the last neverending addition to One Piece (of Shit). To make matters worse, they insist on recommending me Generic Otaku Pandering Moeshit EVERY SEASON and they refuse to watch anything with less than a thousand filler arcs. When will they learn?
