Thank you to the entire 2.007 team - the professors, the shop guys, and the wonderful UAs - for the crazy amount of time and dedication you put towards us students. I think I can say that we all got a lot out of this class, and even if we didn't learn anything about design and manufacturing, we at least learnt that there are people out there who truly want to see us succeed.
