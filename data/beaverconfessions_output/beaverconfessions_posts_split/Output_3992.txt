Dear XhiDae Otam, I just want to grab your afro and rip it out of your head like a bull charging into a Chevy Honda. It's sexy... and you're naughty. Oh but that's not the only thing you are. No no no. You are so much more... so much bigger than the average... You are... a truly singular person and although now you experience this through pain someday that very same pain will be useful to you because anything or anyone worth their space was forged through adversity. Your Friend "James" Perez.
