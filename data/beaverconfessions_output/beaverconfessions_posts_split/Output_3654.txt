I think that from one perspective, the singleminded way that lots of MIT students work on the things they care about is really great, but sometimes I can't help but feel like my interest in science/engineering is all I really have in common with the people around me. I'm a junior and for most of my time here, I kept hanging out with a single set of people,but now I'm at the point where I'm having existential crises such as: did I do things right? etc. I'm trying to meet more people, but it's hard to really connect with others when the main thing so many people keep talking about is science/engineering.
