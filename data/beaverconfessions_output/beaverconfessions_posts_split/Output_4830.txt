I'm white.  Every time I walk through Lobby 10 and see the Identity Booth/Oscars setup in Lobby 10, I can't help but feel sadness and, more than anything, guilt. It's irrational for me to feel this way, because I'm totally for equality and I DO acknowledge that our country still has issues with race.  Even though I'm not responsible, I still feel guilty and defensive. The last thing I need is more negativity and stress when I'm walking to class everyday.  I wish we could address these issues in a different way.
