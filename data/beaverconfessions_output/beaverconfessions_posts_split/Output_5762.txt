When I hear about the protests about racist administrators and halloween costumes at different schools, I wish that students were as willing to organize with this kind of speed and energy in response to other pressing issues in our society as well. I'm not saying it should be one or the other but I wish that we students cared as much about huge problems with our economy, environment, infrastructure, public education, unjust military action, etc. as we do about our own damn selves. Whatever race or gender you are, being a university student is a big privilege that needs to be wielded with care like white/male/etc. privilege. There's a huge world out there and I hope that we don't lose a chance to do something about it because we're too busy policing each other in the best educational institutions in the richest nation on earth.
