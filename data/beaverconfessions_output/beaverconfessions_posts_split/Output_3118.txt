I once was a victim of severe psychological abuse by sociopath. The person would make false accusations about me and would try and make it seem like he was the victim the whole time to turn everyone against me. It took me a long time to get over it emotionally. But I would like to say the biggest thing I learned from it is that words are just words. They only impact you if you let them. If you find yourself a victim of emotional abuse then I would strongly recommend building your own self confidence and esteem. They can't hurt you that way, which is the ultimate goal.
