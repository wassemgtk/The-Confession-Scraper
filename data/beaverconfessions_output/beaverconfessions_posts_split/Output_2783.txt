1. And as God once spun the whole world out of himself, so too the time will come for the world to coalesce and fuse in such a way as to recreate God. From which follows...

2. God's secret. Contrary to popular belief, he doesn't like to be "outside" the universe. He prefers to be inside it, where, as he himself has put it, "all the fun shit happens". For the eternal enemy of God is not, and has never been the Devil (for in fact the two of them are one and the same being), but good old plain boredom.

3. From the Declaration of Independence of a future Human nation: "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all lifeforms are created unequal, that they have no rights whatsoever apart from those that the ruling caste deems expedient to endow them with at any given time, and that Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness are not ideals to be placed over free men but mirages with which to confuse the weak minds of slaves and lead them to their holding cells".

4. The so-called "real" is merely someone else's fantasy.

5. The anti-racists say: there are no races. There are no lions, tigers, cougars, jaguars, panthers: they are all just cats. There are no blacks and whites — we are all just people. There are no people and animals — we are all just lifeforms. There are no beings and things — we are all just parts of the flux. Which strictly speaking is true, but which, by depriving us of any possible words and concepts, in no way helps us analyze anything or even so much as communicate — by which fact the will of those who reason in this way stands revealed.

6. "ALL CULTURES ARE EQUAL. WE SHOULD LOVE AND CHERISH ALL OF THEM EQUALLY." O rly? And what about the cultures that practice human sacrifice? Are those equal too? Or how about Viking culture, or samurai culture, or Taliban culture, etc. etc. etc. But what the subhuman means by "culture" is merely some funny costumes and exotic dishes (which, by the way, are not equal either). That's how far his understanding of the concept of culture goes. And so it is with everything. So while hypocritically professing the equality of all cultures, he is hard at work in their destruction, and in the universalization and domination of his own: subhuman culture.

7. In short, all cultures are equal, but some are more equal than others. The subhumans are the pigs in Orwell's parable, and even Orwell himself was one of them: an eloquent and crafty little pig.

8. Napoleon's tomb at Les Invalides. The feeling of weight here would crush even an Atlas. This is no mere "man's" tomb, is what the architect is saying to you: a superhuman being must lie here. And now compare him with the celebrity nobodies if you want to understand the meaning of the word "nausea".

9. "Life's too short" means: "my power's too small".

10. The microscientists claim that there "are" 4, or 6, or 27 dimensions, dispute each other's claims and try to "find" exactly how many dimensions there "are". But a dimension is not something that exists outside the brain, but a mere concept that the brain creates and projects onto its environment in order to "understand" it (i.e., as I'll be explaining shortly, predict its behavior with a view to shaping it for its wishes). The microscientists have once more mistaken their models for reality, and have confused the question of the number of dimensions of the universe (infinite — which is to say the same thing as one), with the number of dimensions in their models (the more the better). The more dimensions a brain can resolve, the more subtle, more powerful it is. Which is why the microscientists say that there "are" 4, or 6, or 27 of them — and I say infinite.

11. If you say, "it is not fair that his parents are rich and mine poor", you might as well say, "it is not fair that he is tall and I am short". And why stop there? It is not fair that the earth turns around the sun, the sun should turn around the earth — at which point the sheer absurdity and wretchedness of the whole business becomes obvious.

12. How does resentment feel? It feels like unfairness, injustice. It directs the gaze outward, to protect one from dwelling on the flagrant lack of power which led one to feel resentment in the first place. It is not the Other that is causing the resentment, but yourself, and all resentment does is protect you from this painful realization, which would be otherwise added to the already unbearable pain of the resentment's cause.

13. The kingdom of God is inside you, said the Nazarene. But the subhumans are still looking for it, not merely outside themselves, but even "outside" the universe. You can lead a mule to water...

14. I have nothing but love for my teachers. To be resentful of and hate your teacher is the first symptom of the bad, the hopeless student. And to envy him of the mediocre.

15. The shallow thinkers — who want moreover to pass to you for "humanitarians" — say: "Don't investigate the people, investigate the system". But the people are the system. Who do you think created the system? The magical system fairies? Investigating the system ends up leading you back to the people; more precisely, to the psychological processes which led them to create it.

16. The confidence fagotry. "Just be confident", etc. The most they can do is bluff, but a man who's bluffing will react very differently from someone who's the real deal when pushed — and then all your stupid blanket advice will manage to accomplish is to get some poor little weakling's face smashed in.

17. Understanding goes from higher to lower, there's no understanding from lower to higher, only misunderstanding — some absurd simplification/falsification/reinterpretation of the signs. I am not talking to you, you just happen to be within hearing distance while I address the ones I am talking to. Moreover, there's no question of you disagreeing — or even of agreeing with me, since you can't even parse what I am saying. We are neither agreeing nor disagreeing; we are not even communicating. You are just flapping your lips; I am the only one here who's talking; and as I've just explained, and you've failed to understand, not to you.
