For the past year, I've considered converting to a new religion, and in the past few months I've begun.  Why am I so desperate to keep this a secret?  Because where I come from, people's decisions get misinterpreted all the time, and the bigger the decision, the more stinging the backlash from your peers.
Just so certain people who might know me don't misjudge me or take this the wrong way: This has NOTHING to do with you.  I've had this connection to the Jewish experience and religion since I was 12 or 13.  It's just that I've only recently been able to figure out what it means and what to do with it.  I can't help that my timing sucks.  I can't help that I fell into an exhausted and dehydrated sleep Saturday night and had to stay up late because of it.  I can't help how scared and nervous I feel when I see people I know when I'm going to a synagogue.  I can't help that this semester feels harder than it should be because of the 18+ units spent researching this, going to services, and reflecting on where I want to go from here.  I can't help that I sometimes sit in my room and cry because the world has butchered and persecuted these people for so many centuries and for no reason.
This process is fucking hard, but I love what I've learned and who I've met and who I've become because of it.  I just wish I had the courage to open up and not do this alone.
