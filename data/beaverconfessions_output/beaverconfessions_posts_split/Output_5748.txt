I've just come back to MIT from a short break away. I feel like almost every conversation here is about some trivial thing that might be intellectually interesting but at the end of the day makes no difference to the world, and is pointless. I feel like people here exist in some happy nerdy bubble with no idea of what the outside world is like and whilst that was great before, now that happy nerdy bubble is annoying me. I'm sure MIT is better than most colleges, but I wish people would just be more genuine and talk about things that really matter rather than some interesting philosophical concept. I find it hard to put into words exactly why, but the people at MIT are really annoying me.
