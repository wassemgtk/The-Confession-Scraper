While we're all sharing S^3 confessions... I went to S^3 freshman year after some stuff happened and I needed to miss class. My dean (not going to call anyone out specifically) immediately jumped to suggesting I take the rest of the semester off, or at least get my finals moved/excused. All I wanted was a note from S^3 excusing my mandatory attendance class and maybe allowing me to be late on a pset. Instead, I found my dean was incredibly emotionally manipulative, making me think I couldn't handle what had happened and needed more drastic measures (going to mental health, time off, regular meetings). I wondered (and still do) if this sort of emotional manipulation is why so many MIT students are dependent on S^3 deans. 

I made up some lame excuse about having a meeting and eventually ghosted them when the dean kept asking for follow-up meetings, and never went back, even when stuff got rough over the next four years. Terrified the hell out of me.
