I spend a good five minutes every morning actually reading the Spam Quarantine Survey in my mailbox. It feels good to know people send me love (in addition to their shameless money requests) from places as far as Bujumbura, Burundi, and I think I'd be a multi millionaire if I summed up all the jackpot money I have won so far.
