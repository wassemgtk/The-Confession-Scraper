The dance party on Kresge was lit AF at the end. There were old people, young people, hot people, not-so-hot people. It seemed like the entire community was eager to just let go and get rowdy. I was surprised MIT could turn up that much. Please make this a thing, at least once per semester. (It doesn't affect me. I'm a senior, but still it would be awesome.)
