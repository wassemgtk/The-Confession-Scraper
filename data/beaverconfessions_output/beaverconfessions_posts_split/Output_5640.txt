For which of the following reasons (if any) is it legally permissible to deny service, and why? 

Person is:
1. Black
2. Asian
3. Gay
4. A Christian fundamentalist who insists creationism be taught in public schools
5. Someone who holds anti-gay views
6. A member of the Black Panther party
7. Someone who voted for Romney in 2012
8. A feminist
9. An ExxonMobil employee
10. A doctor 
11. A Planned Parenthood employee
12. A Giants fan (yeah, I'm a diehard Patriots fan, I hate the Giants)
13. A Harvard student / alumnus
14. Someone who wears glasses
15. A member of the NAACP
16. A member of the Westboro Baptist Church
17. A member of the Ku Klux Klan
18. A registered child molester or convict of a violent crime
19. Someone I hold a personal grudge against
20. Someone who dresses in a way I don't like

Just to be clear: I'm intereseted in the legal answer and its justification, not the moral 

answer.  To what extent does the requirement to not discriminate override the fact that service 

is a voluntary transaction?

No, I do not intend in any way to compare the above groups to one another. 

Yes, this is an honest question.
