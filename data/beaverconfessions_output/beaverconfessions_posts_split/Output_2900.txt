To the person who interrupted the show during Chris's opening speech by hiding a speaker blaring porn somewhere in the room (actually wtf?). it was the single most pathetic childlike behavior. I get that you don't like the show, so don't be a part of it. Start your own. Make something. Create something. That's a few million times harder than tearing someone else's hard work down (and failing at even that).

What the fuck were you trying to achieve? I knew you're a selfish asshole, but now a few hundred more people are aware.
