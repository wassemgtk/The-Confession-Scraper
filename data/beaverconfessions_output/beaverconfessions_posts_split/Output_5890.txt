I was having a discussion with my friends about Ferguson and its impacts since then. And a white friend of mine said, "the facts of the case do no matter, what matters is a black man was shot by a white cop". Hang on a minute, if this were a black cop shooting a white man, or a white cop shooting a white man, or a black cop shooting a black man, the facts would matter. But they don't matter if it's white on black aggression? I stopped the debate to tell her that I saw that as paternalistic racism. She looked down on black people, and saw that as a good thing. Thus we need a little extra help because we aren't good enough to measure up to white people. Regardless of the case, the facts matter, if the individuals involved happen to be a different race, it does not necessarily mean the incident was race based, unless you have evidence to prove so. She apologized and got horrified I saw that as racist. I explained to her that she meant no harm, and I'm not angry, that I just want the same assumptions about guilt and innocence as anyone else, and that you shouldn't assume either based on race.
