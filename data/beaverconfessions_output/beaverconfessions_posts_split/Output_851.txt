To #7572, I understand to an extent what you mean. My girlfriend broke up with me over text the night before my birthday, a few days before prom, and a week before a trip I was signed up for and had to go on because she had told me I wasn't supportive of her if I didn't go...Sometimes amazing and terrible things coincide at once. We're so lucky to be able to go to MIT, and being able to go is outstanding. However, sometimes the bad things in our lives make us overlook it.
