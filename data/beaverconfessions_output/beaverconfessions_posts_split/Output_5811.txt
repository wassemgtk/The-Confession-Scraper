I feel like a lot of racial activism portrayed by the media nowadays is very binary. It's always something to do with black vs white when in reality there are other racial minority groups out there that are often forgotten in discussions surrounding racial tension. For example, cop beats up Asian senior, media does not play the race card nearly as much as when a black guy  gets beat up. Discourse surrounding racial discrimination and diversity needs to involve a diverse group of people rather than just a couple.
