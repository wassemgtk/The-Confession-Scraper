Last night I had a mental breakdown, crying and hyperventilating due to being so overwhelmed by work and stress from classes, research, fear of failure, and personal issues. A few minutes into this, I thought, "Shit, I need to get it together so I can get back to work." What the fuck are you doing to me, MIT? IHTFP.
