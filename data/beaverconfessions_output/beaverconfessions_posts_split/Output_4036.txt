I see so many confessions about penises, I feel compelled to say -

I have honestly never understood fascination around penis size. My penis is small - if you don't like it, don't handle it. I don't care whether it is satisfying or not. If it's not satisfying to you, just say so and let's either make it pleasurable or you can have sex with someone else. I don't hide this fact - if you make out with me, things get funky and the clothes come off, you're going to see it, and you'll either run with it or run away. Either way, it's what I've got, so use it or lose it.

Nobody deserves an unhealthy sex life. Be honest with your man - work with his penis, or don't. If it isn't pleasurable, say so. If your man wants to make you feel that orgasm, your man will work with you to make it happen. If not, oh well - use your sexuality, find a larger penis if you so desire. It won't break my heart. I would rather you let me know that my small penis is inhibiting your sexual pleasure, so that we can figure out how to please you sexually. Or find different sexual partners. I'm not the only one who gets to orgasm around here - I want you to, too.
