Let me tell you a story of heartbreak at MIT. So, I used to wave at this senior house girl everYday. Walking down mass ave...In the infinite...At la vardes and at all the other romantic spots. So, I meet her at a party and ask if I could hit it. She agressively declines. Well, now we don't wave anymore.
