The constant jokes about how annoying and invasive the UGC people are is so depressing. They're raising money for a good cause, and they try to get your attention so they can do a better job of that. And if you really can't afford to donate, of course that's understandable, but I seriously doubt that's the case for everyone bitching about it. It wouldn't kill you to stop for a minute and donate a dollar.
