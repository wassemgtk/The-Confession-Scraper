The lack of understanding of affirmative consent here is genuinely disturbing. All it means is: your partner should appear actively enthusiastic at all times, and if ever they don't, a quick "Are you okay" is enough. This is not complicated, not difficult, and frankly should be natural for people who aren't deeply selfish and unpleasant. People who argue against this seriously concern me, because it implies that they have previously had sex with people who weren't enthusiastic about it, which is very sad and very worrying.
