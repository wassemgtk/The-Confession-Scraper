Is it bad that I don't like any of the classes I'm taking right now? 3 GIRs and 6.01. I tell myself that once I start taking more classes I'm actually interested in, I'll like them, but that's what I told myself last semester too. I thought 6.01 was gonna be at least interesting. I always liked coding and circuits and shit, but instead the fact that I'm struggling in 6.01 is making me doubt if I'm actually meant to be a course 6.
