I hate it when people reply to confessions saying "Go to MIT Mental Health."  For two reasons: (1) that advice makes MIT Mental Health seem like a mystical black box in which your problems will be mitigated but it's not as simple as that and perhaps much more importantly (2) I once took that advice and was screwed over for a whole year.  I don't want to go into detail but they made me feel like complete shit.  I thought that maybe my experience was just especially awful but when I talked to friends, they said that they had similar experiences at MIT Mental Health.  I found out later that working it out with my boyfriend's help (who actually cared about me) was a lot better.  Sure, going to MIT Health was a good first step (made me realize I had a problem), it didn't help my problem at ALL.

So maybe try MIT Medical but I would definitely suggest telling some you trust your problems.  Maybe a parent, a sister, a uncle, a good friend, anyone.  It's so much more helpful than telling someone who just wants to check off boxes to diagnose you and throw pills at you.
