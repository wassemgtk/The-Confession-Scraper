You told me you wanted me. You told me I was good. You told me you couldn't wait to see me next semester. You raised my hopes and let me dream. You gave me confidence in myself. I believed in you. But when I came back, you turned me away. You tore my happiness, the best part of my day away from me. And the worst part is, I loved you. So fuck you, I won't dance to your rules, your tune your show. I'll dance for myself. Fuck you. I'll dance for another team instead.
