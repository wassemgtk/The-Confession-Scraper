A previous professor of mine, a predominant figure in his field, makes the same joke in his farewell address every time he teaches his class. The roaring laughter that ensues, is not only confusing, but painful to me because I feel that this joke hugely undermines the progress MIT has made towards racial inclusion. 

I'm not the best at discussing whats racist and whats not--I find my emotions usually get the best of me in these conversations. In the face of these issues, I usually just shrug my shoulders and learn to live with the harm. I'm not trying to impose on his freedom of speech, I just am fearful of what harm this might propagate when you have a very admired professor at a world class institution showing his students that there is no harm caused when making jokes like this.

I almost want to post a link of the joke here (its on OCW and youtube, which is how I suspect he makes the same joke every year), but I'm not sure if it would do any good to publicly shame him and have people comment on his specific word use or debate whether or not what he said was actually harmful. But to me, when someone makes a joke where the punchline is based on the western born stereotype that "all asians look the same" , well that brings up a lot of pain, especially if this person is well respected in a community that students of color are trying to thrive in.

Its been a year now, and these memories and this pain still resurfaces whenever conversations of race come up in the news. These videos are still on youtube. And he'll probably make the same joke again this year. I'm looking for some closure or a solution but its not the easiest to talk to people who demand to be convinced with whatever they deem to be logical when the harm is a very obvious experience for me.
