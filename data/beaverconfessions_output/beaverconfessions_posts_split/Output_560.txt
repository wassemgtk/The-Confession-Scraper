I feel so shitty saying this but I came into MIT with such a high standard for myself that getting one B has caused me a lot of internal pain. And I know I'm a shitty person for thinking it. I should be happy if I get all Bs, given the caliber of MIT, but I was wondering if anyone else felt this way?
