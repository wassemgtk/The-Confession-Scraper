We shouldn't have content warnings for talking about things like sexual assault and racism, because we can't warn people about them in the real world, and so they should all just get over it by being exposed to it. It's like how we can't warn people about all the food that has nuts in it, so the best way to deal with someone who claims to have a nut allergy is to throw nuts at them until they stop being crybabies so they're ready for the real world.
