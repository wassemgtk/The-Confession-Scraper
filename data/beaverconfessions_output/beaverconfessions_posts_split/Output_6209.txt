I've probably met 100s of ppl here now and am still yet to meet even one who isn't amazing in some way. And yet for a place with the most amazing people I've ever met, this place does a helluva impressive job of making literally everyone feel the exact opposite way. Here's why, and this next part is going to sound rough, but I hope you read on beyond for my explanation: The fact is that I do consider some people to be more amazing than others, I mean that's only natural. That doesn't change the fact that everyone I've met here is amazing, but simply reflects the fact that we all have our own ideas of amazing. For example, the most amazing person that I know based on my standards of amazing is someone who always seems insecure/scared/inadequate for not having the best scores/stats/accomplishments but never fails to check in on a friend, which is a trait which I consider important enough to make them my most amazing. Similarly I've heard ppl consider someone who's gotten '200 top company job offers' (Clarification: That's intentional exaggeration) to be the most amazing. The point is that we are all so amazing that I guarantee that someone out there considers us to be their most amazing friend/acquaintance. Yet we are also so competitive, hell, we needed to be to get here, that we drown out that voice that considers us amazing and hear all the voices that consider us well, at worst, less amazing. Remember this quote:

"You are the most amazing person I've ever had the privilege of meeting" -Someone, perhaps your best friend, your significant other, or someone you'll meet in the future, but I have no doubt someone has or will think this about you, and listen to them cause they're the ones who are actually right. I mean they're calling you the best person out of 7.1 billion people, which means you're pretty fucking amazing.
