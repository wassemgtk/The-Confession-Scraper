After hearing all the S^3 horror stories, I'm regretting opening up to a dean about my mental health issues and I'm paranoid that S^3 will violate my trust and make me another horror story. It feels like the cards are already stacked against me with my medical issues. I don't want to worry about if a department will actively work against my hopes and dreams.
