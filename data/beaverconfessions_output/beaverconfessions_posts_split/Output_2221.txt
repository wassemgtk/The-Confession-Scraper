Relationships are a waste of time. Every psychologist knows "love" is a manufactured fiction that people pretend is a thing, like money or Christmas. Any couple that stays together longer than 2 years is just a pair of people lying to themselves. Humans didn't even evolve to form long lasting mating pairs anyway, so what's this bullshit about soulmates and finding Mr. Perfect when guys are just horny monkeys designed to compete for sperm?  I only feel lonely because my hormones don't listen to logic...
