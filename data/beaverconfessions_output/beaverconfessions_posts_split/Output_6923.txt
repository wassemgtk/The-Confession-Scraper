I keep on hearing people trying to say that MIT students are not people who lack social skills or who study in their rooms all day, and that they're actually normal people. Even before this semester started one of the freshman posted a blog in our facebook group about how people told her she was too pretty or normal to go to MIT and she felt like she was being discriminated. It seems like the people here who are really outgoing and social are almost ashamed of the people here on campus who are not like them. The reality is that many people here are quiet and introverted or weird. And I'm not sure those outgoing people here would be the same way if they had the same experiences I have had with people. Don't pretend that the nerdy, weird, or quiet people here don't exist. I exist :(
