All these people are posting about the Ferguson, Mo situation.  Am I the only one who believes Darren Wilson is innocent?  I'm glad he didn't get indicted.  People have a right to self defense in this country.  If you go and assault a cop, as Michael Brown did, what do you expect will happen to you?  Now, it's too bad he killed him, not denying that.  But if you were a cop, and someone was punching you in the face and threatening your existence, wouldn't you also do what you had to do to protect yourself?
