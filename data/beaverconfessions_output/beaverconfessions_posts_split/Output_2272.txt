Why does everyone think "Campaign Finance Reformâ„¢" is so important? Do you think every politician will magically stop begin corrupt if some law is passed saying they can't receive money from certain people in certain ways? Do you seriously believe all of those big evil corporations won't find another way besides campaign donations to buy politicians (something they already do btw)? You are never going to get money out of politics with some bs law that does absolutely nothing to address the roots of the problem. Corporations aren't still buying and controlling politicians because we just haven't yet passed a law saying they can't do that in one particular way. Money is in politics because human beings in general, and especially those who are successful politicians, are inherently corrupt. If you don't want corporations buying politicians then don't give politicians so much power and control over every aspect of society that they're worth buying in the first place.
