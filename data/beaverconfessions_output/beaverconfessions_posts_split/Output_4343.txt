The animosity of the food blog post may have clouded the actual message that OP was trying to get across, but as a poor kid, I feel extremely cast out by everyone all the time. My friends don't understand what it's like not to have any money ever. They want to go grab lunch or go on trips or get me to join a frat, but I can't afford any of it. So I lose friends. And before any of you say "well then they aren't good friends I'll b ur friend msg me" and get 90 fucking likes, no. Because it's not that they don't like me because I'm poor, they don't like me because I never hang around with them when it's not studying or work. So fuck it. Where's my minority group?
