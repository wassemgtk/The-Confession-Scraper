That's it. I'm sick of everything. Right now I feel a PROFOUND loathing for almost everyone I know. Yes I'm talking to you, neighbors. To you, class peers. To you, cousins. 

I'm sick of life. Today I stayed in bed all day. Fuck this world, there's nothing in it besides you people whom I profoundly loathe. You're not worth it.
