I constantly feel like an outcast... I've been trying to make meaningful connections with people, but no matter what I always get left on the outside. I'm never in the 'loop' no matter how hard I try to be in close contact with people and no one cares to fill me in when I ask. It's frustrating and makes me lose hope on the prospects of really ever finding people in college, better yet my lifetime, that I can have reciprocal authentic relationships with. I don't what to do anymore and it's really causing me to have a negative college experience :(.
