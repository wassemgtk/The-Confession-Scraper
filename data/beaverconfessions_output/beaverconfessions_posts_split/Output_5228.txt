Sometimes I wish I had been born in some of my friends' family instead. I wouldn't have been as smart, but I would've been happier. I wouldn't have had to compare myself to my genius parents, and I would've had amazing people as siblings who would've loved me for who I am, and not for who they expect/think me to be. Or, if only for a second, my parents could truly see me and not that perfect image that they have, if they could stop making up excuses for me, and just accepted that I am not that smart, and not that hard-working - pretty lazy, in fact. If they could just see that there is nothing left of their perfectly righteous child and accept it and still love me. But no, no matter how hard I try to open their eyes, they just won't listen. But even if one day they do see the light, I know it would break their heart. I am just so tired of everyone assuming I am this brilliant and self-confident person, who is also an angel at heart. I am not. I am neither of those three things. The worst part, if people knew, they wouldn't respect me as much. But if there ever was a person to love me for who I truly am, I would be so much happier than I am now, with all these blinded people loving something I am not.
