Looking back at my time at MIT, I realized too late that I hate course 6. I like computer science, but every single class in I took 6 (for 18c) sucked. 6.01 was a shithole. 6.042 had an awful structure. 6.006 was ok but I was awful at it, 6.005 wasn't fun at all. And so on. If only I had realized I should have done straight 18...
