That other guy vouching against gun control makes us all look bad.  I don't want to hurt anyone, I don't want more mass shootings, I'm fine with more stringent background checks, waiting periods, etc. (The NICS system needs an overhaul/replacement) and most of the people I've talked to in the gun-owning community feels the same way.

Nobody wants more deaths, truly.  We just want to fix this problem and no two people can agree on how it should be done.  I look to Switzerland as an example.  They have lots of guns but a nice low crime rate, because they're doing it right.  The U.S. has some serious problems in comparison.

In the meantime, I just want to secure my right to shoot at pieces of paper in an indoor environment with my expensive toy.  I don't want to hurt anyone.  If I have to go through a week-long waiting period or a more stringent background check, take government-mandated classes, etc. to prevent some shootings?  Totally, I'd have no issues with that.
