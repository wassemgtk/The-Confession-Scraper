TBH I find move-out day more stressful than finals week. Finals week is a game of everyone nursing you through spread out tests. Move-out day is a social test to see if you made enough friends who you are brave enough to ask for help when they're probably just as busy (or if your parents are in driving distance) in 24 hours. Well I'm shit at it and it and have ended up crying a ton both times. Last year I almost killed myself trying to move my mini-fridge, and a big part of me didn't care if I did. I guess at least I've gone from no friends to one friend.
