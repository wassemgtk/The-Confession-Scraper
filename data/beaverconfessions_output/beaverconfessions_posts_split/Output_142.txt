As a technical major, the HASS classes I've taken are solidly the best classes I've taken while at MIT. I'm so tired of seeing all these people shitting on HASS classes, and I'm so tired of seeing people shitting on HASS as a whole. Your favorite book, music, artwork, TV show, games: none of that would exist without HASS. It's OK if you don't like studying it, but don't you dare try to devalue the humanities. This whole elitism of MIT students in science and engineering majors needs to stop.
