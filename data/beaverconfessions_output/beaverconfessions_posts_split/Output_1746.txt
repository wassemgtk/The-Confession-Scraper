I think students at MIT need to face the stark realization that not everyone is intellectually good enough for some of MIT's classes, and it's not their fault. It's the fault of the admissions process. Admitting a student to an intellectually very demanding four year struggle when they are just not capable does no favors to that student's mental health. Fix the admissions process MIT. It's your responsibility.
