Pi day makes me feel nostalgic because I always relive all the sensations I felt when I got my MIT acceptance... 

I was screaming

parents responding,  returning  from the dinner table  

they were looking as if they knew, and – I'll never forgetti– they ask,

"If you had one shot to seize everything you ever wanted, would you capture it or let it slip?" 

My palms are sweaty

knees weak 

arms are heavy

vomit on my sweater already

mom's spaghetti
