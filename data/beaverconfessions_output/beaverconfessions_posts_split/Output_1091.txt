[$100 REWARD] This isn't a confession but a request for help. There is a big community here that lets me get the word out.

*Someone stole a grey/neon green Underarmor backpack from the 2nd floor of the Student Center at around 5:45 PM Thursday, May 12th. 

*Please report any sightings of this backpack to sxyang@mit.edu. 

*The backpack contains 2 notebooks full of final exam notes for 8.02 and 18.03, a pair of AEO jeans, a Vera Bradley wallet with ~$400 in cash and a MD driver's license. 

*A $100 reward is available to anyone who helps me locate this. 

*MIT Police are involved, but there is little they can actually do due to lack of surveillance cameras in the Student Center.
