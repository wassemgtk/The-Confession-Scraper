People here need to watch what they say.  The other day I heard someone in the lab say, "this way of doing things is so nearsighted!" Do you know how offensive that is to me, and the millions of other nearsighted people in the world? I've worn glasses since I was four, it's not something in my control, and every time I hear something like that i want to punch someone.  Some people really need to learn some respect.
