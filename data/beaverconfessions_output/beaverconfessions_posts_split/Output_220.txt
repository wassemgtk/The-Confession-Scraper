People around me including my family and classmates keep telling me how well I'm doing and how on top of things I am. But honestly, I don't feel like I'm doing anything right nor am I particularly good at anything. I don't understand why they believe in me so much and why I was even admitted to MIT. I feel like a disappointment and a failure and that anyone saying otherwise is just trying to be nice. All I want is to see in myself what others see in me.
