You treat me like shit, refuse to acknowledge my existence, and I sort of hate you for putting through so much misery.  But when I see your face I can't help but think about how I've had the chance to stare into the most beautiful brown eyes.  I think about your fingers twirling your curly hair in the most adorable way.  I think about how there was never a dull moment with you.  I think about how natural it felt to be myself around you.  When I see your face, I can't help but smile.
