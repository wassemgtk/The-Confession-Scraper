I'm not a great person. I think a lot of people think I am, and by virtue of always being the good kid and getting into MIT, a lot of people back home/in the family look up to me and stuff. I'm not doing well. I'm secretly just a piece of trash. I might have developed an eating disorder. I don't feel too great most of the time these days. The beginning of this year was going great, and then I got sick, and now I'm already behind even though I went to S^3 and everything. And I don't want to do well, or be the kid that's looked up to, or the one that has all the responsibilities (oldest child, immigrant parents...) I just want to be angry and sad and irritable, and not smile or talk to people when I don't want to. And with regards to MIT, I just want to give up. But I can't.  I don't deserve any respect or admiration, and I don't want any of it either. I don't want anything.
