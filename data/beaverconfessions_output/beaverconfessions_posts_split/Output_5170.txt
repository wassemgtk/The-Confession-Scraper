I began my morning as usual in my kitchen. I reached to make breakfast and left to use the bathroom. When I came back I took a sip from my mug and immediately spat it out. I then turned to my grinning roommates and angrily asked, "Who put coffee in my whiskey?". They know how I like my morning whiskey, straight up.
