I ended up as an odd third wheel in an Obamacare debate the other day. One guy said we should repeal it, the other said it's fine. What neither said pointed out was that both their ideas suck. What I think we ought to do as a nation is address the fundamental causes of sky high health care prices which no plan addresses. For example, you cannot import drugs from other countries. You can get them so cheaply elsewhere, but it's illegal to get them here. Another problem is buying insurance. You can't buy across state lines. So each state insurer gets their own monopoly and doesn't have to compete. Democrats say the old system was capitalism out of control, Republicans say the new system is socialism out of control. It's crony-ism out of control. If we address these fundamental flaws, insurance will be irrelevant.
