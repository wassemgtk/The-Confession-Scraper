I have honestly tried to watch Doctor Who and I really hate it. I think that it is not even worth a minute of Spielberg's Back to the Future, a true classical masterpiece compared to this psychedelic crap that has the masses swooning as if it's 1984 or a Ray Bradbury classic. Please don't give me this "it's only your opinion" crap, because I am already aware of the 99% of people who are reading this who have been brainwashed with this utterly horrid show. Go read some Charles Dickens or something for a change.
