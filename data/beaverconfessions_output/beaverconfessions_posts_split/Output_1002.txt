I am grading 6.006 and I feel so bad for some of the students I am grading. I sympathise with you guys, the DP pset was the hardest when I took the class, and the fact that it is due at the very end when you have to juggle so many final projects and there are limited DP examples in class is just insane. I just hope that many of the students that handed in incompletes don't feel discouraged... rock on guys and good luck on finals!
