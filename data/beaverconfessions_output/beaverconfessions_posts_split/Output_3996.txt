I'm known as a pretty chill guy that won't get mad pretty easily, but I do have one button, and whenever people press it I end up holding this grudge against them for the longest time, so I'm going to bring it up here.

The best fucking way to enrage me is, when I'm not understanding something at first glance or as fast as you'd expect me, to tell me "But you're an MIT student." This has happened multiple times in my wing, and in my own house in Virginia. It's conveying the idea that, as I haven't gotten what you want me to get yet, I am either some inferior being, or aren't trying hard enough, or just don't want to understand. In addition, it serves no purpose but to vent whatever frustration you have. It's one of the most venomous comments I've heard over the past several years. Just because we go to MIT doesn't mean we are going to understand everything in a highly-above-average timeframe. The existence of variance in test score distributions prove this, and I've been at the tips of both ends before.

In fact, I'll go so far as to say that a good portion of the MIT student population isn't actually that "smart". In fact, you don't even need to be smart to get in here. The reason we have not-smart students at MIT is because they were chosen for their passion for their field. They came in here loving what they did, and willing to work hard to keep up with the people that can get things faster than they can.

The reason this infuriates me personally is that I've been particularly good at math. 18.100B was a cakewalk my freshman fall. So I've gotten this comment more than others. But I may not recognize that this one TV show character is the physical embodiment of emotional abuse, or I may not recognize why particular shot-calls in League are shit. Then people pull this line out, and it makes me completely unwilling to move forward with anything.

If you use this line on people in general, I recognize that you're probably not a dick, but please try to catch yourself beforehand in the future.
