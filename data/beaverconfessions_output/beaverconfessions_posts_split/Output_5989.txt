I love MIT. The workload and nagging feeling of incompetence gets rough sometimes, yes, but if that's the price I have to pay to learn all that I'm learning (inside & outside the classroom) and to form all the relationships I'm forming, then I'm happy to pay it. I love my friends, I love my boyfriend (perhaps soon my fianc√©), I love my department and its faculty and staff. I love Boston and Cambridge, I love my dorm, and I especially love my living group. I got so lucky.

Everyone's experience is different, I know. It pains me that so many people posting on MITConfessions are having such a hard time, and haven't found that happiness that I've found. I won't pretend to know the panacea for that, but I do know that if you're continually miserable here, then something needs to change. Change dorms, change majors, change friends, change perspective. If something isn't working, you change it. Reach out to someone (which, yes, is terrifying) and talk. I sincerely believe that most people here will want to help you make that change and find your happiness. I wish the best for all of you.

As a senior, I've seen MIT at its worst, when morale dips low and the administration is stagnant. I've also seen MIT at its best, when the students are lit up with the creative energy that got them here and are excited about innovation, about making the world better, safer, cooler, happier, and when MIT uses its vast resources to enable us to put our ideas into action. When students support each other through thick and thin, when professors go that extra mile to answer panicked pset questions at 3 AM, when TAs and staff and Housemasters go above and beyond to make sure you're doing okay, that you have the resources you need -- that is MIT at its best. I wish everyone could feel it.
