Tbh, I'm glad we've had a black president, and maybe a lady prez next... the next step would be to have a gay prez. But even that won't be enough. Let's not forget that other parts of the world aren't as civilized as we are (having a gay prez is a much more achievable reality for us): we have yet to see a gay North Korean dictator and a gay Iranian supreme Ayatollah.
