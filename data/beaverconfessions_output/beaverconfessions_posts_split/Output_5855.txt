I made a confession about college campus handling of sexual assault cases earlier. The feedback was good, but one commenter on it I would like to respond anonymously too. This commenter disagreed with me because she felt that a rape victim should not go the court because it's a long and difficult process where a campus one might be easier. I believe she wants to help people who have been through a trauma and I commend her. I disagree for a couple reasons. The first is, it's a public safety issue as well. Rapists statistically tend to be serial, odds are left alone, they will strike again. This is about making sure the rapist does not strike again. The school has no power to stop the individual, a court can throw the man in jail. Also, even if the court fails to secure a conviction, the man will have an arrest and investigation record for sexual assault. This will help the police keep an eye on him, and may help prosecute him if this ever occurs again. Also, by going to the police immediately they can perform the rape kit test to get blood and semen samples, along with other trauma evidence that is critical in getting rape convictions and will help convince the defendant and his lawyers to plead guilty, as oppose to going to trial. Even if you don't do this immediately you should still go anyway, you may still be able to get the guy convicted on an assault, unlawful sexual contact, or battery charge which is better then nothing, will get him expelled, and keep him from striking again. Yes, if you go to trial the defendants lawyers may imply you are a liar or a slut, it's their job, hate the rapist, not the lawyer doing that he legally has to do.

The issues with going to the school are as follows. The school does not want to do this at all, and will likely default to some wishy washy punishment, such as making the rapist leave for a year, then reenter classes or writing an apology letter, (this has actually occurred at colleges). If you get him in trouble with the school, with no formal court process for sexual assault, you could be sued by the rapist for defamation since you have not proven nor are in the process of prosecuting him for sexual assault. At best you get the guy expelled with no criminal charges, he enrolls in another school where they can't legally find out why he was expelled, and gets the greatest deal ever. And if you lose there, then what? The guy has no criminal record over it, he's off free with the school, and now he's free to continue to prey on girls at college parties.
