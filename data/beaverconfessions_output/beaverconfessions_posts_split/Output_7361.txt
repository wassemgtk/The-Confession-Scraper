I know it's just a game to you, but I can't separate what's true and what's not anymore. This hurt me so much worse than I thought it would, so much worse than before. I can't sleep, I can't eat, I'm wandering around like a ghost, and every time things seem better, I discover something else, something worse, something that makes me feel sick to the stomach. The little bit of bread I did manage to make the effort to put in my mouth, I had to spit out a good half of it. And I want to go back and listen to what you have to say but chances are you won't understand. It's all a game to you. I should have known that.
