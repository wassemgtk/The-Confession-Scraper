to #6284 - I think it's important to realize that MIT is a very large institution, and that these changes to security, dining plan policy, and fossil free MIT thing are not something that happen overnight. It took MIT over 3 years to make Add/Drop forms be online.  It still hasn't done this for minor forms.  If that takes at least 3 years then even considering a change to any of the things you listed will take well over that amount of time.  In a way, it is discouraging. But I think the better way to think about it is that the world won't change overnight either - it should be a lesson of perseverance and determination to enact change and not get discouraged if it takes a really long time.  

To be clear though, I'm not justifying MIT's slowness to change. I'm against huge bureaucracies for this reason. I'm also not a fan of saying at least we're more progressive than the Ivies where it takes even longer to change things. We shouldn't compare ourselves to anyone we should just do the shit that needs to be done.
