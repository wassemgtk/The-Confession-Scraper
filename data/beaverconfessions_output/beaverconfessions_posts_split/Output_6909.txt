I'm a white girl only attracted to asian girls. I feel very comfortable being openly lesbian at MIT, and I'm very thankful for that. But I feel extremely uncomfortable discussing my specific racial attraction with anyone because it's 'textbook racist' behavior. There's always the assumption that you're some sort of exotic-seeking-yellow-fever-pervert. ALWAYS.

I've made genuine efforts to be physically attracted to non-asian people but haven't been able to. I'm not sure I fully control that. I REALLY have tried. But my sexual attraction doesn't make any assumptions about your culture or dictate your social worth--it's pretty much based ONLY on what you look like. And apparently, I'm not attracted to non-asian faces. I don't understand why that's necessarily racist. On the other hand, no one thinks I'm sexist for only liking girls. 

Yes, all my relationships have been with asian girls, but they've been meaningful and with people I loved, and saying that I dated them "just because they were asian" is like saying I dated them "just because they were girls". I only date people I can be attracted to--but that's not exactly shocking behavior.

But there's SO MUCH stigma against white people exclusively dating asian girls.  I don't know if I'll ever feel comfortable talking about this part of myself, even though I don't understand why it offends people. Why does it feel like all the orientation tolerance and openness at MIT extends only to a narrow range of "socially acceptable" sexual orientations? Doesn't that defeat the point?
