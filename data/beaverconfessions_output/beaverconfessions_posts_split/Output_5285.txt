Whenever I see an animal (rabbit, squirrel, dog, cat, etc.) staring at me, I'll start acting really crazy and maintain eye contact with them the whole time.  Like I'll make really weird faces and start dancing crazily.  I do this in public all the time (since I was 14, maybe younger - I am 21 now).

I like to imagine that they are like "dammit, I thought I was just starting to understand humans.  Back to the whiteboard."

It also embarrasses my mother to no end so that's another plus.
