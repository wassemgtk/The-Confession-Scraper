Every person I want to date is either on a committed relationship, or just doesn't want to date anyone. I feel I'd appreciate for once someone just going like "I am available, but you are reaaaally fugly so no..." just to change the pace a bit. Like I can work with that, I can put on a paper bag or something.. idk
