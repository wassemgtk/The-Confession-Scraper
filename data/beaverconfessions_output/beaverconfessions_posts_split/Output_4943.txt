I am so excited for my (hopefully) last semester here at MIT. I have learned so much from this place both in terms of academics and in ways that I can't really describe that well in words. And I can hardly wait to begin my life after graduation, a life that I will pave myself on the opposite side of the country....away from you....whom I would be leaving behind....and am crying just thinking about it. You will still be, and must stay here. You are the only thing that I will not want to part from and perhaps my time here at MIT has one more thing to teach, and it is the painful lesson of a relationship that has reached its end but not necessarily in the heart.
