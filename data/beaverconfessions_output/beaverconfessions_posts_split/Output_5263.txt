2.009 gets so much money and attention... it's hard not to feel ignored when you're in another major, working on your own capstone design project, without any of the fanfare... a friend or two outside your major might come to your final prototype presentation. where's our confetti? giveaways? theatrics? insane development budget? publicity? we make things too... anyone else think 2.009 gets way too much spotlight? I get that the class is insane, but it's not the only insane class out there. just the only one with this level of showmanship and disproportionate attention.

I can't help but feel left out/jealous/salty/ignored. help.
