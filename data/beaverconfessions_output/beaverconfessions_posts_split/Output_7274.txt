I am stunned at the 2017 class council's show of abject discrimination in their ticket sales for the Spring Formal. They advertised in their emails to the 2017 class that they would be selling tickets in dorms, but not a single East Campus dorm was listed as an option. Really? Not even a single attempt at reaching out to over 150 of your fellow class members? I'm devastated at this display of incompetence. The student center, evidently, counts as a dorm while we evidently do not. Such fail. So wow. Much disappoint.
