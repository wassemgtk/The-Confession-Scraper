I enjoy the fact that people commenting on MIT Confessions automatically assume that anonymous realists and nihilists are "probably just depressed." Keep living the fantasy world. I think deep down you know we are all right. No one cares. You're alone. Nothing wrong with that. 

On a vaguely unrelated note, I found myself at an interesting thought regarding this whole discussion. Liberals (read: most everyone commenting around here) tend to support religion much less than conservatives, but both groups essentially do the same thing! Conservatives place their faith in an unprovable phantom being, allowing them a vent for things going wrong and events they can't handle without a safety net fantasy. Liberals do the same thing, but they project their own insecurity onto the myth of "the goodness of mankind" and pseudo-"morality."
