"I would never tell anyone who feels victimized that they should keep quiet, never have, and never will." "calling someone a criminal when they have not been found guilty of committing a crime cannot occur" Aren't those two statements in conflict? How can you support rape victims and say that they should share their stories, but at the same time say that they can't ever name their rapists unless they've been found guilty? We all know that courts are stacked against them, and something like 2% of rapists ever get convicted. By saying that the other 98% of victims cannot name their rapists, you're effectively silencing them and constraining what you think is acceptable for them to say. This is not support. You're putting up more barriers and making it harder for them to come forward. I get the problems here with someone spreading an accusation across 20 people and with anonymity, but saying that no one can share their story unless they've won a criminal trial agrees wrongly equates truth with the justice system. We shouldn't be pushing rape victims to report if they don't think it's best for them, and we shouldn't tell them they can only share their stories if they've won a trial. The self-guilt is strong, and this makes it worse. I worry that my friends who've been considering sharing their stories won't after this, because they know there's no criminal evidence and they'll never win a trial and it's scary to see this from a GRT (who we turn to for support). I'm sad that they might imagine trying to share this with their floor and having the response be that they can't share it because they haven't gone through the criminal trial. I'm hope this isn't what's happening, but it seems likely ):
