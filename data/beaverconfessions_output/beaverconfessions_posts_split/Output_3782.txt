I had made every single mistake
That you could ever possibly make
I took and I took and I took what you gave
But you never noticed that I was in pain
I knew what I wanted; I went in and got it
I'm still breathing, 
I'm still breathing,
I'm still breathing, 
I'm still breathing,
I'm alive!
I'm alive!
I'm alive!
I'm alive!
