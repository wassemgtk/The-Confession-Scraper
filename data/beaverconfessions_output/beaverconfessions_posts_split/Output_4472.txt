I remember when I was in high school and I thought "i'm never gonna drink. I'm gonna be a good person and not get into all the bad shit that my peers are getting into." i used to be disappointed at myself when i found myself at 7-11 at 3am. now, as I sip my, idk like, 4th drink of this wonderful monday night, i can say i am no better than anyone.
