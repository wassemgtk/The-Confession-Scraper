When I came into MIT as a freshman I was excited and enthusiastic about the place but I feel like the time I've spent here has crushed my dreams and expectations.  It's not so much the academic pressure as the monotony of doing the same thing every week - study, pset, party, repeat.  Life here seems so predictable, and looking back it seems like my time here is devoid of so many of the adventures and other crazy moments that define most peoples' college experiences.  The social scene seemed great at first but so much of it revolves around psetting or partying that there's no time left to do normal things.  Once you get over getting drunk, there's not much to do.  With the time commitment of classes and sports, most people don't have time to go places or care about things, and most clubs I've seen don't do much.

The administration doesn't seem to care much about students opinions or wellbeing, and while some professors do care it seems like most don't care about there students nearly as much about their research.  MIT taught me to work hard, but it also turns people into soulless, apathetic, workaholics.  The dorms are falling into disrepair and the dining is overpriced for its quality.   

I know there are many good things about MIT, and I would be lying if I said I haven't enjoyed parts of my time here.  It's just that when I look back on the past few years and see everything I haven't been able to do and everything I've had to give up for the institute, and when I see what's become of that excited, happy frosh, I wonder if all of this has been worth it.
