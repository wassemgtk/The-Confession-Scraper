It's kind of sad when you lose a friend to a relationship. "He/ she" becomes "they," and what you once felt comfortable sharing becomes uncomfortable because there is constantly another person over their shoulder. There's nothing to be said or done, because you do genuinely like this new person and would never jeopardize your friend's happiness. But it is sad.
