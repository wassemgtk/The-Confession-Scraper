I know it's been ~ 4 months, but sometimes I dream that David Bowie's still alive and that he's on the Esplanade playing music for us all to come and listen, and we do.
But then I wake up and realize I was dreaming, and I feel sad, like he died all over again. :( :( :(
Everyone seems to be over this, so I feel like kind of an idiot for still missing him.
