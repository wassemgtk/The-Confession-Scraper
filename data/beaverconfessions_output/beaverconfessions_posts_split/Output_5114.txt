Real talk, sorry for yet another bleak post but...

Does anyone feel truly profoundly happy? Sure I have happy moments and even happy days, but I'm not sure I've ever been able to say with conviction that I am happy in any long term sense. It seems like others feel this way too, so I ask, in all seriousness, does anyone reading this feel truly happy? To see that it is possible and exists in our community would make everything a little bit easier.
