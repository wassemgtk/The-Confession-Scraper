I never got my Brass Rat because I don't care much about "MIT culture" and people have been shaming me for not having more school pride. I really do like MIT, but I'm tired of being pressured into conforming and being told I'm not a good member of the community for not being more enthusiastic about MIT rituals. I'm feeling more and more alienated because of this.
