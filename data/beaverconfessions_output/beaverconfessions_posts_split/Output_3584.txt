Nationalism shouldn't be characterized as a negative. Having pride in your nation and wanting to maintain it (including its borders, people, and economic and moral prosperity), is far from ignoble. People like to throw around phrases like "no human is illegal," but the fact is, America would be crap without borders. Our success is the very reason people want to come here so badly, and you're willing to throw that away for some humanitarian wet dream? Diversity is proven to increase intrasocietal strife. Have you ever questioned why globalism is your moral high ground? Who put that idea in your head? In the end, anti-nationalism and multiculturalism will destroy every culture in lieu of a uniform consumer base.
