Today a manager looking guy from Verde's yelled at me for  microwaving a lunch I had brought from home using one paper plate, and he cut me off before I got a napkin, because apparently "this place isn't free." Pretty sure I paid for that plate five times over when I bought three days of food for more than I spend in two weeks at Shaw's...
