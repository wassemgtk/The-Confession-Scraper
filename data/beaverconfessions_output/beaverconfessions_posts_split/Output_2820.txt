Thanks to all the current students who put on an awesome CPW! It was cool meeting people but even cooler seeing students come together to put on a weekend of fun shit. From nail tutorials to building lightsabers to eating salmon, you guys fucking rock and it’s because of that that I’m choosing MIT over Stanford!
