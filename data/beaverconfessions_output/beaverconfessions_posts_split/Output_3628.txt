As a West Side freshman and after all the random Senior House hate and rumors I read on MIT Confessions I'd like to give a shout out to the waitresses, dancers and cooks of Deli Haus. You guys were funny, talented, smoking (pun intended), you killed it. And the food was honestly not bad. I wish there was more unity and openness between the East Side and West Side. There aren't a lot of events like Deli Haus where curious West Side people like me can come and meet East Side people, hang out with them and get to know them without being judged for being "boring Westies"
PS to the only male waitor: you worked those thigh high heels!
