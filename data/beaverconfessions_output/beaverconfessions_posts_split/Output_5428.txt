Whenever I realize I'm having feelings towards someone, I'll either be too busy with classes to think about it further or try to make an argument to myself that I'm just being lonely/irrational/procrastinating and bury myself in psets again... Not blaming MIT but still sad that subconsciously I'm not even allowing myself to have a relationship here.
