im a sophmore and ive had a love-hate relationship with course 2 since coming to mit. im starting to think that I should switch to course 6 because i really love the more ee and cs type projects that im getting to do in one of the classes that im taking this semester. but, i cant shake the feeling that if i switch majors ill eventually end up wanting to switch back to course 2. if course 2 were a person we would definitely be in an unhealthy relationship. but it's not. and i want to eventually graduate, too x(((
