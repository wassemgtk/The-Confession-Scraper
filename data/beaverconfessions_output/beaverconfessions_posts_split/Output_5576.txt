I just want to acknowledge the students at MIT who take time out of their buys, stressful MIT schedules to volunteer and try to raise money though the UGC. It takes balls to put your face out there and ask fellow students for their financial support. As a former tech caller, calling alumni over the phone for pay to ask for donations was one thing, but asking people that you recognize in person for no pay is another. Bravo.
