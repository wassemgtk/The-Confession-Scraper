@4973 who posted wanting advice about depersonalization/derealization- I am not comfortable posting non-anonymously about my mental health symptoms on a public forum, but I have created this email account: depersonalization.sucks@gmail.com that you are welcome to send to (I will not remain anonymous past the first email, and if you are concerned about anonymity you too could create a throwaway). In terms of tips, a lot of people find something physical grounding. For example, eating an orange (which smells a lot) or stomping your feet. Interacting with someone who knows you well and to whom you are comfortable disclosing your symptoms can also help. Finally, please get help. I don't want to scare you, but for me depersonalization has preceded some really alarming behavior and thoughts. My thoughts are with you, OP.
