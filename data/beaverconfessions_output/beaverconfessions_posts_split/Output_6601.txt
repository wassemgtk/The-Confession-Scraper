I was reading some [census] figures and trends the other day that disturbed me. I have always been a proud atheist, and a activist for atheists. I looked at the US birth rates. Secular and atheist birthrates are the lowest, and well below sustainability. Fertility for atheist women is about 1.5 children, hardcore religious, 2.5 - 6 per woman! Meaning the next generation of atheists will be smaller. Meanwhile the hardcore religious have the highest birthrates of all. The amish, mormons, devout Catholics, evangicals, all breed like rabbits. In the last 20 years the amish population has TRIPLED from birthrates alone. Immigrants here also tend to be more religious. If this continues in a couple generations we will go from a nation making secular progress back to a religious hive on the level of a middle eastern nation. So I urge all my fellow atheists and secular members, please make a point to have more children and raise them atheists. A good number to be safe is 3 or 4 children per couple to insure atheist population growth. I'm terrified to live in a world full of religious fanatics in a couple generations.
