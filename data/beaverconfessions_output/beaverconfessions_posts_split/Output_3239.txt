Dear 8.044: you just assigned us a pset twice as long as the others. You have an exam next week. WHY WOULD YOU NOT CANCEL THE PSET DUE ON THE DAY OF THE EXAM? You realize 8.04 has an exam the next day, right? Students are people too. I would like to sleep more than once between now and next Tuesday. Sincerely, course 8
