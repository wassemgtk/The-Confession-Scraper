I hate how people bring their dogs inside, especially in enclosed spaces (elevators) or not on leashes. If it were a well trained dog, I might assumed it was a service animal...but it never is. It's always some asshole pet that's triggering my fear-of-dogs instead of letting me pay attention in class/take the elevator/go about my life.
