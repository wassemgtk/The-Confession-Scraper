I haven't been recovering from my break up for quite some time, even my ex was telling me that I should go at see people.  My friends took my phone, signed me up for a dating app, started finding matches, and unknowingly matched me up with my ex's ex =_=.  
Then I realized the likelihood of such event is actually quite high, considering my ex was attracted to someone who had plenty in common with her which leads the matching algorithm to match me, who has plenty in common with my ex, also the dating pool for the lgbt community isn't all that big.  
Anyway, mission abort.
