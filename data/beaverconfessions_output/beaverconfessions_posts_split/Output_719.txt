The lady who swipes IDs at Next dining every morning at breakfast (and sometimes dinners) is the sweetest person. Even though the line to get into dining became long, I watched her take her time and have a genuine conversation with each person because she wouldn't see them until September. And she is always willing to help with Spanish speaking practice no matter how bad I might be. Talking with her every morning is a great start to the day!
