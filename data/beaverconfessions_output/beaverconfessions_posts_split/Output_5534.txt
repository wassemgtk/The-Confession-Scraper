@2888, this sounds like you.  Leaving you for good is the thing I am most proud of myself for doing. If you weren't so horrible to me I wouldn't have been strong enough to do it.  I let myself feel the horrible pain of losing you, I let myself feel it completely and didn't try to villify you to stop me from caring.  But finally, I stopped caring.  I stopped thinking about you and feeling like I would see you again.  I used to think we were soulmates, that there was no way we wouldn't die together just based on how close I felt to you.  I still remember but what I can see clearly now is all of the abuse you put me through. That was some text book emotional abuse and it wasn't OK and I will never stay with someone who does even a fraction of what you used to do.  That's why its so easy now to forget you.  After I stopped caring about you I was alone and it was beautiful.  To not have to fucking answer to anyone.  And then I met someone and I fell in love again.  Its different and so much better.  He is so much better to me than you were, he never tries to hurt me, he makes me so happy. I might marry him in the future.  Anyway, i deleted my response so many times because I didn't know where this message would end or exactly what I wanted to say. Basically I am so proud of myself for leaving you, but am grateful of everything I learned because of it.
