I just started taking classes in my major (Course 6). I thought that with each  pset and project I would learn and get better...Well now it's nearly halfway through the semester and it seems like I'm still where I was in the beginning. It's not that I don't spend enough time studying. I probably spend double the time most people take to code something, study for a test or finish a pset. But somehow, even with all my classes and UROP and projects, I don't feel like I'm actually learning new things. I'm not getting any faster at figuring stuff out and my breadth of knowledge is not expanding fast enough to keep up with my UROP. I used to think I was a fast learner but this just seems like a painfully slow process

Has anyone else felt this way when they were first starting course 6, or any major? I've dreamt of coming to MIT to study Computer Science for ages but now that I'm here, I don't know if I'm cut out for this
