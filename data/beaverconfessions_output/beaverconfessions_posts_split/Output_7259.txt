I feel pretty dumb for having to drop an intro class my freshman spring. And because of the credit limit, I'm down to 42 units. I feel like it puts me behind in my plans since I'll have to retake it later (it's a req for my potential major), and it makes me wish I'd started the semester differently. I wish I'd taken advantage of P/NR by finding out how much I could handle and developing good study habits. I wish I'd prepared over IAP, and I wish I hadn't started to procrastinate the very first day. I feel like I'm STILL in the process of figuring out what works for me, and it took a toll on my performance. I don't want to wish all these things because there's no use in wishing, but I can't help but let it bother me. I don't want it to bother me because there's nothing I can do about it now. But it does.
