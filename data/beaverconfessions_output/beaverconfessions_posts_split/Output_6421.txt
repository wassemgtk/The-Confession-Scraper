Seeking: 
A non-committed, non-platonic, but also non-romantic "thing" for the remainder of the semester.

Terms of the relationship:
-We meet every other week for cuddling and Netflix watching
-We meet every other week for Netflix and not cuddling
-We donâ€™t have to talk, but we do have to like the same shows on Netflix (or other streaming service, I also have HBOGo)
