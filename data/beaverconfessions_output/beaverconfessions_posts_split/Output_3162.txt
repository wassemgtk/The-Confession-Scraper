@5197, 5227 is on point. Also it's really hard to notice when friends need help. Yes, do it when you can, but no one reads minds. If you feel bad, if you aren't doing so well---seek help. Tell your friends you need someone to talk to/sit with for a few hours. Tell them you feel sad/lonely/inadequate. If you have no friends, tell Mental Health, S^3, whatever...COMMUNICATE HOW YOU FEEL. ASK FOR THE HELP YOU NEED. #lifeskillz
