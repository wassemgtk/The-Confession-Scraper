That moment when you realize that a group of pigeons fighting over bread has better organization than Career Fair, you know, only the most important day of the year for a lot of ppl -_- In case/when ppl come to defend the fair I'm in particular talking about the no day off and the maximum inefficiency registration and 'oh wait there's more' 30 minute line to get a pointless but mandatory sticker.
