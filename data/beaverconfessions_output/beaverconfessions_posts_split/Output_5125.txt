Is it my obligation to refuse to sleep with someone I'm physically attracted to, even when s/he makes advances on me, because s/he is currently in a closed relationship (with someone I don't know well)? S/he doesn't want to deal with a breakup, and I don't really care about being a side affair, because my feelings are purely physical. I'm not inclined to give up a fun sex partner for the sake of feelings of someone I don't really know. How much of a jerk would I be if I agreed to sleep with him/her?
