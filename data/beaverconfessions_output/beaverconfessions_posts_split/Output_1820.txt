I think Technique did a great job on the yearbook, but I don't think the front cover should ONLY say "2016; TECHNIQUE"... Since this is the MIT Class of 2016 Yearbook, I feel like they should've at least written something alluding to that on the FRONT COVER.  Do they always do this every year?  Am I the only one kind of peeved by this?
