I find it incredibly hard to believe that anyone might feel that their relationship to me has any meaning to them. Other people make me happy -- is there more to relationships than just that? Whenever someone tells me that they do value our relationship, that I am a good friend, etc. I think they're just trying to comfort the emotionally stunted shell of a human I am and don't mean it.
