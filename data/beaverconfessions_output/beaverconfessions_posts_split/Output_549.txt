MIT does a good job with the free food and free events things, but they're really poorly advertised...there was a tent on Kresge today with an open bar and free food, apparently for everyone, but I just passed it by because I assumed it was for alumni or something! Come on MIT! Let's have a weekly news bulletin, or post events somewhere that's not the MIT app, because let's be real, that shit sucks.
