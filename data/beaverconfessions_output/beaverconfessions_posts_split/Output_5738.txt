#2710, in response to #2672: (this comment was also posted on 2672's thread)

To the ignorant person who wrote confession #2672,
allow me to crush your arguments.

Why the fuck do you think we should trust Chomsky?! or even worse, Gilbert, for that matter?! The fact that Chomsky is a brilliant linguist doesn't mean he can tell right from wrong, it just means he can tell "a" from "b".

I can see that you are very impressed by numbers, so let me satiate your hunger for numbers with a few more examples. In WW2 approximately 1,000,000 German civilians were killed as opposed to approximately only 10,000 Americans and 100,000 British civilians. Following your logic, you must be thinking "oh, those cruel Brits and Americans! They had so few deaths and yet they slaughtered the poor Germans". This is a perfect analogy to the argument you've presented above with the body count. You don't determine in war who is right and who is wrong by tallying casualties (unless you believe that the allies were the bad guys in WW2).
You should ask yourself why were there so many deaths among the Palestinians and so few among the Israelis? (This is how a mature person approaches serious issues). And the answer is simple, according to Israelis values, civilian lives matter more than soldiers' lives. That is why we send our troops to the front line and keep our population in the back. But for Hamas, this is not the case. For them, it's "combatants' lives matter more than civilian's lives" and that is why their combatants are underground, hiding from Israel's bombs, while their children and civilian population is on top, being used as a human shield. Of course, Israel also has Iron Dome, which helps keep the death toll low. But imagine what would the death toll be were it not for Iron Dome? Hamas has fired thousands of rockets at Israeli civilian population. If all of those rockets hit their target then you would have thousands of dead Israelis. Maybe then you would think that Israel is not so bad. 
Also, Israel never shoots intentionally at Palestinian civilians with the purpose of killing them (as opposed to Hamas). So (almost) every time a civilian Palestinian dies it is because he or she were in a proximity of a Hamas militant. If Hamas militants don't want Palestinians to die all they need to do is follow the Israeli method - send their militants to the front line and keep the civilian population in the back. I assure to you, there would be 0 civilian casualties in that case.

Talking about the UN, if I remember correctly, it says something about that it's not morally right to fight within a populated area. Then why is Hamas fighting within populated areas?! If you were Israel, and you would have someone firing at you from within populated areas, you wouldn't stand by and pray for the rocket to miss, you would take that shooter down. If a civilian dies in the action, then the blame is on the shooter who was near him. And don't let people tell you that Gaza is so densely populated that Hamas has no choice but to fire from within civilian population. I know of a few open fields in Gaza that can be used as fantastic launching sites. Why doesn't Hamas uses them?... Now, the fact that Gilbert says that he didn't see and combatants near or in the hospital, doesn't mean that that is indeed the case. Hamas headquarter is underneath the Shiba hospital, not in the emergency room. Of course he wouldn't see them. There was a secret military base only a mile away from my home - I never found out of its existence until I joined the military. Conclusion - civilians don't notice things that are not supposed to be noticed!

Now to Israel's doctrine. Unlike Chomsky and probably you and many others, I don't need to read it. Nor do I need to even read about the conflict. I don't even need external sources to teach me about this. I am Israeli. I am the source. I have served in the IDF. I have followed the doctrine. You are simply wrong (or worse, lying). Israel does not aim to cause as much destruction and loss of Arab life. Israel only seeks to cause as much destruction and loss of terrorist lives. And the distinction is important. When I served in the IDF I was ordered NOT to kill civilians. We would do everything in our power to avoid hurting civilians. But sometime avoiding it is impossible because war is not a nice thing. If an Israeli soldier were to intentionally kill an innocent person then that soldier would go directly to jail. If a Palestinian kills an innocent Israeli then that Palestinian immediately gets "fame and fortune" in the Arab world.
If Israel really wanted to be done with the Palestinians then Gaza would have been the world's largest parking lot today. But it isn't. \qed.
