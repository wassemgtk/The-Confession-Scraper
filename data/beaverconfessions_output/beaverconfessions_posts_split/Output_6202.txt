Once upon a pset, I was poring over my own graphite scrawl to find the error, which despite my endless labors had persisted somewhere between the top of page two and the middle of page five, the error, taunting, cackling at my ineptitude, scarecely able to stifle its schadenfreude, tucked away in some subscript, obscure yet plainly there, somewhere, faintly snickering, somewhere, somewhere, when abruptly and quietly nature cast a solitary ray of light, when nature, ever cruelly indifferent to misery and mirth, deigned to arrange a trifling gust to separate two tree leaves outside my window for long enough that a sunbeam could briefly alight on the errant minus sign, as if bidding me to shuffle the symbols once again, bidding me to straighten my wayward rows of curlicues, bidding me to understand the laws they so feebly stood for, those laws by which that selfsame sunbeam made its journey to this lonely earth and my meek desk, bidding me to feel and know the laws unceasingly unfolding, for just a fleeting moment.
