To the men on campus: If you've been reading confessions and keeping up on all of this never-ending stream of consent stuff, I just want to let you know that not all girls are like this. Honestly, if a guy kept asking my consent, I would be so turned off I would kick him out. Women around here need to learn how to take some responsibility. It's not a man's job to speak up for you. It's yours. Barring rape, there's no excuse to blame men for not "asking enough" if you're not expressing any other feelings. And men, you don't have to choose to date women who act like this. Seriously, alpha up and move on. How far are things going to go before sex itself becomes an assault? Feminists, you're making it extremely difficult to find an actual man and not a feminized robot terrified of offending people.
