My boyfriend shushed me in public the other day when I was discussing the medical side of my recent rape, telling me, "Don't talk so loudly about that here!" I asked him why, and he said, "isn't it person to you? Other people would judge you." 
I guess, yeah, it can be a really triggering thing to hear someone talk about how they were given a month long regimen of prophylaxis to prevent HIV after being raped, but... like does anyone else agree with my boyfriend? Being able to talk about the assault is helping me come to terms with it. It took three weeks for me to even admit to anyone that something happened, another two to admit that the guy did more than forcibly kiss me, and four after that to admit it was rape. Is it really that horrible of me to talk about it in public?
