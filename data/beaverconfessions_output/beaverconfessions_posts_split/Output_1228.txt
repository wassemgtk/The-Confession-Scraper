I was sexually assaulted by two different brothers of the same fraternity on different occasions. When they happened, I told my friends and they didn't believe me. The first time it happened I hoped it was just an accident. The second time is when I realized that the guy who did it didn't even realize that he did something wrong. It wasn't a "regretted sex" situation. It was a full on he grabbed me and tried to do things with me and I tried to fight him off and said no over and over situation. Both situations were similar, except the first was in public surrounded by other people in this fraternity. No one bothered to intervene and some made jokes about it. Neither person apologized or said anything about it after. I've come to terms with what happened to me I guess, but I'm scared that this could happen to someone else that steps foot in this place. But I'm not brave enough to report it...I guess I just don't know what to do. I feel like even if I did report it they wouldn't believe me.
