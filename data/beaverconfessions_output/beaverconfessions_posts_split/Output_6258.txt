I fucking hate parent's weekend. Everyone has to put up a facade again to pretend they're still the precious little angel that left to college.  And parents expect you to drop everything to sped time with them.  I'm sorry im not sorry that my project and test take up time.  I can't really control my deadlines anymore than you can control my sexuality
