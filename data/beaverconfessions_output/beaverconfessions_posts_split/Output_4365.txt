Has anyone else noticed that "diversity" just means less white people? This confuses me, as we live in a white majority nation, and no one claims that china isn't diverse enough or that African nations aren't diverse enough...why is it that only historically white nations must bear the burden of catering to minority needs? Kinda reminds me of biting the hand that feeds.
