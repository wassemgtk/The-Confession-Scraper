Is anybody else really annoyed about how far just "networking" can get you? I grew up in a relatively poor family, and my parents weren't friends with anybody, and they also didn't know(and therefore never taught me) any of the American social courtesies. Like, I never ever said "thank you" to anyone until middle school, when people started pointing out how rude I was to not say certain things.  

When I first started going to science camps in high school, I was really impressed with everyone and felt inferior to everyone. I met people who had already done research before, or who had done these science olympiads, or had built robots and stuff. But then I just kept hearing these recurring stories, like "blah blah my parents knew this one guy and that's how I started research" or "blah blah my teacher got me started in this" or even "blah blah oh yeah my relative works in [insert college] admissions, so I'm not worried about getting in" blah blah blah. Oh and also “blah blah I found out about his camp because one of my friends went here.” Lol I felt incredibly odd for being the only person who found camps by googling stuff with the keywords “science” and “financial assistance.” I don't think those people even realize how privileged they are. To have even the smallest bit of guidance from somebody, or a nudge onto a path of success, or the tiniest bit of assurance that your life will turn out fine even if you do one thing wrong-- those are HUGE privileges. 

I find it so weird that had I not started googling things that one night when I felt too exhausted to do work, or started applying to those camps on a whim, I probably never would have even known what a tiny bubble I had been living in, and about the countless opportunities that other people took for granted. I probably never would have applied to MIT. 

Now that I’m at MIT, I realize that I have become one of those privileged people, and that I have the opportunity to network if I so choose—that some person would give something I say more consideration just because I go to MIT. And I hate the fact that door is open to me. I hate the fact that door is open to anyone. After so many years of living in fear of the future, and having no idea where my life was headed, I don’t think I’ll ever be comfortable accepting anything I didn’t directly earn through grueling, hard work. I am afraid of who I would become if I let my successes become a crutch.
