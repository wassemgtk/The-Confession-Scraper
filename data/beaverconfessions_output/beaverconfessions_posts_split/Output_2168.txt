When I went to MIT medical because I was feeling depressed, all the lady (psychologist?) told me was "You should study somewhere outside of your room." Then she went on to judge me for not having a dating life like woman it's not on purpose. I'd love to date. Thanks for making me feel worse that no one wants this.
