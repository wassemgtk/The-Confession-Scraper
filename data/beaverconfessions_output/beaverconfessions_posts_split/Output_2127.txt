Hey 6313! I'm a queer person who has used dildo.io to great success (i.e. starting things with people of the same gender as me).  I think it is a good way to start talking to people, but unfortunately you /do/ still have to do much of the work of communicating what you want and, of course, pinging the person/people you match with to see if they are interested in A Thing.  If you want to talk more, I made a gmail (dildo.io.mit@gmail.com) with the caveat that I /do/ live in a culturally East Side dorm so my experience may be different from yours.  Best of luck regardless!
