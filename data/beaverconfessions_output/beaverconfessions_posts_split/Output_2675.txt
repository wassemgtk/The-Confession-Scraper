A lot of these angry posts sound familiar, so...when you twisted the story around and blamed me instead, I snapped at you because a few years back I was sexually assaulted under similar conditions. It felt like you accused me of hurting you in the same way I had been, despite the grossly different roles we each played. Your false affections and your admitting you used me for sex also strongly hurt me, considering the aftermath of the assault. This whole thing might be why I "won't listen to your feelings." I know you didn't know, but when you would say absolutely anything to paint yourself in a positive light, I really just do not have faith in your word or actions.
