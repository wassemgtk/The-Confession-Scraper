Should I be worried if I'm getting C's in all my classes? I'm trying the hardest I can with 8 hours of sleep and my UROP. I have a fairly solid basic understanding of what I'm learning but nothing special. I could try to get B's, but that would require dropping the UROP I care about and giving up some sleep.
