Is anyone else completely disillusioned by their MEng thesis work? I feel like mine is not as bad as some others, and while I love my adviser, I can't bring myself to do much work on the project because it is so boring to me. I want to switch projects, although I have no footing to do so and have already put 6 months of work (read putzing around) into it. I have 6 months before I start my job, and I need to finish a thesis. Has anyone been in a similar situation? Should I just suck it up and finish this thesis since I definitely can finish by mid August? Or should I attempt to switch advisers this late in the game?
