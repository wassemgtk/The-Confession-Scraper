It's been about four months now since my boyfriend of 4 years broke up with me. He ended it out of nowhere and stopped contacting me completely. I was alright at first, but here I am nearly a semester later still randomly bursting into tears over him sometimes.

All of my friends say I should be angry with him for being so heartless, but I really just feel so guilty. We were so young when we met, and dealt with so many growing pains... there's nothing I can do at this point, but every time I get sad I have to resist the urge to call him and tell him I'm sorry-- to let him know I never knew I was so terrible to him that he'd be able to leave me so easily. To say that I wish I'd been better, tried harder, been so much more encouraging to him than I was. To let him know he's the only person I've ever said "I love you" to because I've never been able to imagine loving anyone else.

I miss him. So. Goddamn. Much.
