Its funny how you can go from one great sem to a disastrous one at MIT. I had everything last sem: the dream girl, the sex, A grades in 5+ classes, the partying, the fun. Everything. Then my girl left me for some meaty frat boy, my sister died and those friends i had neglected last sem cos of the gf time weren't there for me anymore. Im doing four classes this term and im struggling and its been only two weeks. Im so busy with my now three sem long urop, my job etc that i have no time for fun. My life is in shambles. Fuck u , mit.
