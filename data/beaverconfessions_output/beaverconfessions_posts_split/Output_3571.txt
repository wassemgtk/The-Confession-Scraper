#4851 I should have explained a little better.
1. I was annoyed more than anything that the note was anonymous so I was unable to address what the real noise issue was (bed, voice) with the author.
2. I was annoyed at the tone of the note. It was very angry and rude, and I was previously completely unaware I could be heard from the floor below. The author could have at least said "please."
3. I was annoyed the note had been posted on my door for all the world to see rather than discreetly slipped under my door.
4. I live in a dorm where I cannot hear voices on other floors, so I assume it was the bed banging against the wall that was the issue, not my voice. In that case, the word "loud" didn't make much sense. I could have been completely silent and it wouldn't make a difference.
5. I often hear people having sex on the floor above (beds banging) but it's really not that loud, and doesn't bother me. When my neighbors do, however, it does. Pro tip: earplugs. I do it and do not complain. I expect the same courtesy from others.
6. Sorry if I've offended you with the tone of my previous post. I was angry.
7. NO I AM NOT ACTUALLY SORRY FOR MY SEX LIFE. If that wasn't clear :)
8. But I do feel bad for women who are not able to enjoy sex as much as I do. I truly wish everyone was as capable.
