I have a friend who was upset over some of the new trans bills regarding bathrooms, he went on and on about how "you can't actually change sex, you have a y chromosome, you can't make a real vagina on a man with a penis, it's just a cosmetic surgery to give the appearance of one." And he went on and on about poor science, I'm trying to explain to him that he's missing the big picture. When enough people believe something, it becomes accepted as orthodoxy and whether or not it's actually true becomes irrelevant, especially when people want to believe it's true. Take for example, Galileo, he claimed the earth is not the center of the universe. He foolishly messed with the most powerful organizations saying this and really messed up his life in the process. Was he right? Yes. Was it worth it? No. He spent his life being considered a sore loser because he couldn't keep his mouth shut over one little astronomy detail. My point is, if you don't agree with the ideas behind the trans rights movement or question the science behind it, for your own sake shut up. The rest of us accept it, we do not care what facts come out from now on, we will accept it, and speaking your mind is legal, but it may still have consequences.
