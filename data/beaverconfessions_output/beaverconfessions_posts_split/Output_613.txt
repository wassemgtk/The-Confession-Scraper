I wish I had presented less like a straight girl around you. Now you are graduating and I will probably never get to say how beautiful I think you are or really get to thank you for all of our heart to heart talks. The people who get to be around you in the future, romantically or otherwise, are pretty dang lucky. Killer smile, by the way.
