I honestly have zero desire for any sort of physical intimacy with anyone I know: there's literally nobody I want to fuck, kiss, or even hug. I've done all those things before, and have been in committed relationships, but it's always felt shallow and void. Am I asexual? I actually feel like a robot :-\
