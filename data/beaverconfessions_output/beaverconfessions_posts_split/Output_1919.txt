Last year, I came out as bisexual. Most of the people I know at school were pretty chill with it.... But for some reason, I am terrified of coming out as genderqueer. I'm really not sure why I feel this way. It isn't that I feel shame or anything. For some reason I think people will have a harder time accepting me because of it though.
