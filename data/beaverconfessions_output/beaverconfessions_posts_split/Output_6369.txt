I want to take a moment to defend Sanders from some of the haters here. They keep asking, how can we pay for the all the infrastructure spending without raising middle class taxes? Fair question, it doesn't mean Sanders hasn't thought it through. It's simple, we borrow more money. The U.S government is not a business, we have no borrowing limits. And the best part is, since we are the superpower of the world, we can borrow from other nations non stop and if we can't make the payments, we just tell them to take a hike and default. They can't come seize our assets or do anything, they just have to take a loss. That's their problem, not ours. Then we just borrow more at a higher interest rate and more to pay the higher interest, wash, rinse, repeat.
