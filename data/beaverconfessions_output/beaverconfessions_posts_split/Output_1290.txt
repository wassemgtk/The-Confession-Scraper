I am standing in my own way when it comes to having fun and making friends. I get along well with most people I meet, but I fail to nurture relationships. As soon as our interaction is no longer required I let that person fade out of my life. I take the expressway through life - missing out on the scenery of the backroads. Most of the day this does not bother me. It is only during the short periods of my free time that I realize how alone I am.
