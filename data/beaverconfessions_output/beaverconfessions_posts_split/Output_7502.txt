A couple months ago, I started talking to a girl and eventually we started hooking up. In the beginning, I did it purely because I hadn't gotten any in a while and was lonely. When I got my fix, I stopped talking to her. It was only then I realized that I had developed feelings for her and now I miss her. I regret pushing her away so much, and I don't know what to do.
