I'm a conservative on this campus and I'm sick of the victim mentality I'm seeing amongst other conservatives here. A lot tend to whine about their low numbers and how so much of the faculty is liberal. They especially get upset when a few bad apples in the liberal group try and call them racist/sexist/(insert new tumblr social justice term here) in response to any conservative argument. Fellows, there will always be a cheap shot debater. If you really want to advance conservatism on campus, you need to confront these individuals on their anti intellectual stance, and in many cases Freudian slips on race/gender, and make conservative arguments that you stick with and never apologize for having.
