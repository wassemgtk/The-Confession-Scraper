Why do they keep leaving Baker open during breaks? I feel like the only people that make an effort to eat at Baker are the people who live there. And the fact that it was only open for dinner is bullshit. Seriously, we pay a lot for dining. Could we at least vote on which dining hall stays open during the break?
