For all those people who don't know Next House Elevator courtesy, here are the rules:

1. It is only acceptable to take the elevator to floors 2 or 3 if you have a bike, large package, or physical ailment.
2. If the floor 5 button is already pressed don't you dare hit 4. If you really don't want to spend the energy to walk up, at least ride all the way up to five and walk down a flight of stairs. It saves the other passenger time and frustration.

It's really not that hard, people should have figured this out on their own. I'm not sure if they're just oblivious or un-courteous.
