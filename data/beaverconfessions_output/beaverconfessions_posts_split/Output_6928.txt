As a senior who doesn't know what I'm doing next year, logically, I know that right now isn't the time to start a relationship. But lately it's all I've been able to think about. I've never been in a relationship before, and right now I really just want someone who cares about me, who wants to talk, cuddle, and hold hands with me. I have so much important stuff coming up (finals, standardized test, applications), as does every other MIT student, but I just can't stop thinking about having someone to help me through it, who isn't just a friend.
