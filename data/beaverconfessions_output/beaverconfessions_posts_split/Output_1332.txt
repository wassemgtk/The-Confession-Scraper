I am not actually working all that hard with classes and extracurriculars. I do things the night before, spend whole days not working, hang out with my boyfriend for most of the day, and I pass my classes. I have a summer internship. I feel a lot of guilt for not being more ambitious, but honestly don't see any reason to do more.
