I am a mess, I feel extremely happy one moment then I go to my room and get absolutely sad. I met people at the beginning of the year and we would "keep in touch" but it hasn't happened. I feel less motivated than in high school, I don't know what to study. People in my dorm become more and more distant and everything seems to go from bad to worse. When I stop exercising I immediately gain weight, and I don't have the money to be in a meal plan. I just want someone to cuddle and smoke with.
