Red and green traffic lights are a microaggression against my colorblindness.  This is highly offensive to me, a marginalized class.  When will the government stop being ableist and right this wrong?

And all of you, bystanders.  You privileged non-colorblind people, who don't have to experience microaggressions every day.  By not acknowledging the problem and running to the nearest government office and refusing to leave until all traffic lights are pink and purple you participate in my marginalization.  

And you, the guy who wore a red shirt to class today. Do you understand that you support a societal structure that oppresses colorblind people like me, who from birth can't see the difference between red and green? I demand that MIT outlaw any clothing involving red and green, as well as any use of red and green on campus, in any shape or form.  In fact, to be completely fair to all students I demand MIT change the color of grass from green to fuchsia.
