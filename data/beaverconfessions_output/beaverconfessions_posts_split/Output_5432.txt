I remember those nights vividly,
You lay naked on my bed
as I make love to you masterly
Like a bull on rampage
I thrust and thrust
Charged by your beams and moans

I thrust quickly, with force
you moan and clutch
Red colored lee nails tearing into my skin
as you moan with deep pleasure

please don't stop you urge
yes right there
omg am gonna cum
you vibrate and move in spasms
body completely overwhelmed by ripples of pleasure

You call me master
That was the best you'd ever had, you say
I hope these moments never go away
I beam with satisfaction
I was good at the job. No debate.

Love making was like abstract art
Each thrust akin to the drop of color on a canvas
I would move quickly and deliberately
hitting those spots with my brush
until we built a masterpiece

But now, all that is gone
You no longer call me master
You  no longer say my name
I hear tales about you and your new boo
And I wonder if I should find one too

6046 has been pretty tough so I've resorted to writing [very terrible] poetry about my life.
