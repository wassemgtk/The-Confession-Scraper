There's this girl in my dorm (she's a sophomore, I'm a freshman), but every time I see her our eyes seem to find each other... we've never spoken because I can't decide if she's looking back at me or if she's like "who is this guy that's always looking at me" and I feel it's about 50/50 both ways (not to mention I feel she's way out of my league)

She's much more outgoing and lively than I am but when our eyes lock I feel as though we're more similar than meets the eye

how do I approach her? quite honestly she's the epitome of the gorgeous MIT girl and I'm just sitting here a dopey hopeless romantic
