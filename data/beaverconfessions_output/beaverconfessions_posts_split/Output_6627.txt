So we founded this community #StandUpToCancer
Dear friends, 
We are also like you dear friends!! we are just group of few #college going students, but we have a strong hope and desire that one day we will be able to feel proud on ourselves by doing help to #cancer_survivors
And we will strongly feel and we will be able to say:-
" #proudly and #loudly that Yes!!! we did we did for mankind we did for our passion we did for those who wanted to have someone #standing with them in their misery time!"
