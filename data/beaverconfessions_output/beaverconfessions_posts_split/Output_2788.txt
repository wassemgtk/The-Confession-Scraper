I'm not a MIT student. I maybe will never be one of yours. But I've started to follow MIT Confession because I wanted to see what happens there. I have one things to tell you. Your confessions are definitely not as fun as ours. I think you take everything too seriously. I mean you're in the best college of the world, you have many opportunities that I would never have. And you are still complaining. I can understand that MIT is challenging, but you have so many resources that have been created to help you. I'm in last year of bachelor, in 4 weeks, finals will begin. I still have 9 projects to do (it means at least 30h for each), some have their deadline on the same day, some need the feedback of the previous one to be done, feedback that you get 2-3 days before the deadline, but I also have labs, tests, presentation to do. And when you can ask to have more time to do your work, we cannot. When you have TA, teachers, MIT Health, etc to help you, we are alone, no one will help you. And at the end of the year, after 5 weeks of finals, after stopping my life during so many weeks trying to earn enough points during the year to secure decent grades during finals, I will only get D, C sometimes a B. It's how it works in my country. A C is great, it seriously means that you have achieve what you were request to achieve and even more. But with a C, you go nowhere. I'm in one of the best department for computer science in my country but I am also the only one that still has a chance to get her degree at the end of June. So guys, be aware of the chance you have. Take the most you can out of MIT. And when you want to complain about it, remember that many students all around the world don't have the chance to have half of your help, half of your opportunities. And please, enjoy your life as a student, it will happen only one time in your life.
