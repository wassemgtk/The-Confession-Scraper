If you registered to vote in Massachusetts, get out an vote tomorrow, regardless of who you are voting for! 

-- Startling confession: I'm a Bernie Sanders supporter.--
I assume that 80%+ of you are too. He'z within margin of error in polling for Massachusetts. If he doesn't win MA it's basically over. Your vote is crucial. Skip class. Take a bus. Take an Uber. Walk. IDC. Tell your friends at other schools to remind their peers to go out and vote. Seriously, don't let us down.
