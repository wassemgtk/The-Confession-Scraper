I just got deferred from MIT (and probably will get rejected next Pi day), and I am currently wallowing in self-pity and disappointment. I would have loved to get to know all of you wonderful people. I really thought I had a great shot, but I guess someone else deserved it more. Thanks to this confession page for cheering me up a little.
