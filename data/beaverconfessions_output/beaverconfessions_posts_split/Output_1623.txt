As someone who’s about to graduate, I spent most of my days at MIT traveling through the tunnels to avoid slow walkers, acquaintances that I might feel awkward to acknowledge, and people in Lobby 10. With the number of days winding down, I feel this feeling of regret – regret of not appreciating or taking in enough of this great institute. I missed out on walking beside some of the most brilliant fucks that I’ll ever walks next to. Instead I got dark floors, vending machines, and overhanging pipes. The trips through Lobby 10 are winding down. Take in every one.
