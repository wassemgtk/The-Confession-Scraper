I love you but I know that you don't love me. My heart's on fire, right now and I can't stop thinking about u, fantasising about a future with you. This always happens to me. Maybe I'm cursed. Love hurts, especially if it's unrequited. I'm really taking my latest rejection hard. I can't study and can't do anything else but think about her. My friends have tried but God knows they can't help me. From a lovelorn MIT student
