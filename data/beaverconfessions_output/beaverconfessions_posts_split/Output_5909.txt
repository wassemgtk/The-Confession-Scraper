Really getting tired of all the minority protests I've been seeing on the news at college campuses lately. Honestly, minorities here have it better then ever. 50 years ago, most of them would have been lucky to get the janitor job here. Now MIT and all American colleges are begging minorities to come here and trying to tell everyone else to never say anything to displease them. With all the protests I've seen you would think we still had Jim Crow laws. If Malcolm X and Martin Luther King could see these protesters and these conditions they would take turns slapping all of them and telling them just how lousy things used to be for minorities.
