I think asians take more shit in this country then anyone else. Everyone openly mocks them without fear of harm or cries of racism. They get all the loser stereotypes, small penises,  nerds, meek, etc, etc. Nobody looks out for them like various white ethnicities and blacks. They get held to the absolute highest  standards then anybody else in academics just  for being Asian. Yet they manage to thrive regardless and that's why I have such deep respect for them.
