@ #5949 I'm sorry but this isn't sexual assault. You have to understand that if you gave consent before, and then never explicitly said during sex that you wanted to stop AND you were in a clear state of mind, you cannot possibly expect him to know that you wanted to stop. It it not "technically" sexual assault because he had 0 idea that you felt that way during sex. You aren't a whimsical bitch, but if you report someone for something like that, you are completely fucking over someone who did nothing wrong. Please consider what you are doing and think about if the friends you talked to are still respectable people after giving you that kind of response
