trevor's caption on the photo was definitely wrong. but i hope it was an honest mistake that he posted it and doesn't believe it. it sometimes seems okay to say these kind of things when it's in a lot of media like  family guy or south park or something. of course the damage has been done, but i hope people know that he is a really nice person :'(
