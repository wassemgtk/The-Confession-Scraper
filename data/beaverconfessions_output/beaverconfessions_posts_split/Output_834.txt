Anyone here #BernieOrBust? You're laughable. Your threats are empty, your conviction is weak. You will all come running to Hillary when your other option is Trump. And then 4 years from now you'll re-elect her so you can walk home feeling like you're on the right side of history. I'm not mad or anything, I'm just reminding you how utterly predictable you really are.
