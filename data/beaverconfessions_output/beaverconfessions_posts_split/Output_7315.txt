I'm a pre-frosh, admitted EA and as an athlete. Despite the "athlete" tag, I still hang out with a lot of the "academic" kids at my school. It's Ivy day, and my friends are all getting into most of the schools they applied to, but I've only been rejected. I've even gotten rejected from a couple schools that are supposed to be much less selective than MIT. 

Honestly, I’m not as smart as my friends. I don’t try as hard on every little assignment. I’m even having trouble coherently writing this post. I don’t feel like I deserve to be admitted. It feels like all my (very few) accomplishments are hollow. Lots of my A’s were borderline and probably should have been B’s, all I really did was dink around in my oh-so desirable lab job, and I’m not even that good at the sport I was recruited for. And now that some of my friends admitted to MIT are treating it like its nothing, just another option they are hardly considering, and that I was only admitted because I’m an athlete… I don’t know what to think. 

Everyone has been talking about imposter syndrome and that we all belong here for a reason. I feel like whatever MIT thinks my reason is, whether it is athletics or extracurricular activities or academics, I still don’t deserve to be at a place as great as MIT.
