I'm a senior who's recently moved into a new dorm and all of my new friends here are strongly encouraging me to dye my hair (like, pink and green kind of dye), but I don't really know if it's a good idea. I have a bunch of job interviews coming up, and I'm worried that if I dye my hair like that it could hurt my chances. I've asked around here but I think the people in my dorm might be biased. Is it seen as less professional/could it hurt my chances if I had my hair dyed say, bright pink and green?
