Why does nobody in this dorm understand what elevator etiquette is? It goes a little like this: Elevator stops. People get off of the elevator. People then get on the elevator. Then the elevator moves.

So stop being an impatient twat, waiting with your hot breath 5-cm from the opening door and shoving me to the side as I try to exit the elevator. The next person who does this is going to receive a rude awakening when I forcibly shove your ass back the way it came.
