Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to teach ya
But I ain't done much learning

Hello, can you hear me
I'm in California dreaming about going to MIT
Where I will be quite free
I've forgotten how it felt when everybody was passionate

There's such a distance between us
Of three thousand miles

Hello from the other side
I must have applied a thousand times
To tell you I'm happy about everything that I've done
But when I don’t think you’ll ever be my home

Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To hope you’re sorry for breaking my heart
But it don't matter it clearly doesn't tear me apart anymore

Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened

It's no secret that I (especially)
Am running out of time

So hello from the other side
I must have applied a thousand times
To tell you I'm happy about everything that I've done
But when I don’t think you’ll ever be my home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To hope you’re sorry for breaking my heart
But it don't matter it clearly doesn't tear me apart anymore

Ooooohh, anymore
Ooooohh, anymore
Ooooohh, anymore
Anymore

Hello from the other side
I must have applied a thousand times
To tell you I'm happy about everything that I've done
But when I don’t think you’ll ever be my home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To hope you’re sorry for breaking my heart
But it don't matter it clearly doesn't tear me apart anymore
