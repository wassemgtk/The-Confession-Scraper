My senior stein has a crack on the inside and although it looks good from afar, I'm pretty convinced that the quality is terrible.  I wonder if I'm going to get brain damage one day from drinking out of this mug.  I wish that the senior council would sell a few high quality items instead of many sketchy ones.
