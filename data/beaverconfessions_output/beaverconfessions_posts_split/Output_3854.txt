I'm not sure how I feel about transgender people. Like, I get the whole "your body, your choice" type of thing, but at the same time it seems like psychiatry doesn't have a consistent position on these types of issues. 

For example, some schizophrenics believe that they no longer have an arm when their body is intact. Psychiatrists attempt to help the patient cope with the way their body is, not try to alter their body to fit their mental representation. I don't really care if you are trans, I just want to understand the logic behind it.
