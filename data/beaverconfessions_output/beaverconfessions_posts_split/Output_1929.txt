My mom keeps asking me to send her pictures of me at events I go to. I keep telling her that I usually miss photo-ops by chance or that no one was taking pictures because I don't want to tell her that I hate how my body looks so much that I avoid being seen on camera. This kind of thing goes against everything she taught me growing up but I just can't get over my self-consciousness. Usually I just end up staying in my room alone.
