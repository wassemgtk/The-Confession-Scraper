The number of times I have seen a bicyclist mess around with 18 wheelers THIS SEMESTER ALONE is ridiculous.

One time I saw a guy riding down the sidewalk (mistake 1: there is like a bike lane a yard away in the street) and an 18 wheeler was backing up into the loading dock of the stud.  The back wheels of the 18 wheeler were about to cross the sidewalk and the truck was beeping loudly (reverse beeps) and also the driver was loudly honking his horn.  The guy biked right behind the 18 wheeler.  Somehow (I honestly have no idea how), the driver saw the bicyclist and stopped.  The guy never once glanced at the truck.

A truck had a green left turn light but a bicyclist decided to run a red light and rode right in front of the truck.  Once again, the truck had to stop, but this time the bicyclist appeared out of nowhere and the driver had to stomp on his break.  (Also, btw, bicyclists, stop running red lights).

A bicyclist was once riding down the wrong side of Vassar, while an 18 wheeler was in the process of turning right (on a green light).  The bicyclist decided to ride all the way up to the corner of the intersection and suddenly found himself squeezed by the sidewalk on one side and the large turning truck on the other.  The driver didn't see him (the bicyclist was going down the wrong side of the street so it is reasonable that the driver wasn't even looking there) and the bicyclist started cursing the driver out, screaming and smacking the side of the truck.  Eventually the truck stopped turning and the bicyclist got off his bike and got onto the sidewalk.  But the bicyclist continued to curse out the driver.  The worse part is that this happened right by the white bicycle at the intersection of Mass Ave and Vassar.  The bicyclist was literally yards away from the white bicycle.

Of course, there are a lot more times when bicyclists decide to not obey the traffic laws and almost get hit by cars or almost hit a pedestrian.  I am a bicyclist and often times, I'll stop for a light or because I will see some danger up ahead (a car might be turning right or might be emerging from a garage) and the bicyclist behind me will overtake me and glare.  I was once glared at by a driver for what the bicyclist behind me did (the bicyclist cut her off).  Stop taking chances with your life.  You are giving bicyclist bad names.  There are three simple rules to being a bicyclist on campus - ride in the bike lanes, heed traffic laws and look at the car in the right lane when going through intersections (they might turn right without looking for a bicyclist and they may be wrong, but you could be dead).
