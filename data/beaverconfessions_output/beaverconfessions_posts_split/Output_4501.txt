It's ridiculous that as I'm sitting in the MIT Medical Urgent Care waiting room with a pounding migraine - pain level 10, nausea to the point of vomiting, that preference is given to two other people, one with mild chest pains and the other who made an appointment. Oh I'm so sorry I didn't predict a migraine at 2pm today, schedule an appointment, then walk cheerfully and smiling into the ward ahead of everyone else who has waited an hour there already. Also this system of preference didn't factor in with the other three people who had arrived in urgent care before me when I checked in, because apparently a need for crutches outweighs a migraine, but chest pains trump everything. On top of this, after they finally called me in and set me up in an exam room, it takes THREE HOURS for the doctor to finally come see me - and you know what's already gone by that time? The migraine and my patience. Also I don't really trust a doctor who needs to check his phone for dosage info and then still butchers the spelling of the drug on my prescription. So thanks MIT Medical for being completely incompetent.
