I wonder if I'm actually depressed if I find my self saying 'I feel like dying' more than once everyday. A friend of mine makes it very important to clarify the difference between 'clinically depressed' and just 'thinking' you're depressed. I don't have suicidal tendencies or anything, and I'm constantly optimistic that things will improve sooner or later and engage in several fun activities to keep myself occupied. However when it involves my work that's not going well, and when I think of some people who I have to deal with everyday, I just find myself trying to escape. I just feel like going to other things that make me happy, but I also know that's just me trying to escape. I also don't know if what I'm experiencing deserves any attention or empathy from others...I guess it's not worth thinking about if I'm not 'clinically' depressed?
