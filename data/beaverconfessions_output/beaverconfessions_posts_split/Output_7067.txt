I'm a freshman, and it's driving me crazy not being able to be intimate with people like I always could be with people I knew for so many years at home. I know it just takes time to get closer to people and figure out which people I'm able to connect with best, but I have a lot of trouble putting myself out there and meeting new people when I don't have one or two people I'm really close/intimate with. I feel like I'm in a rut.
