Sometimes when I feel like my life is spiraling out of control and I'm going to fail everything at my second-tier school on long island, I hop onto the MIT Confessions page and realize my life isn't that bad. For people who the rest of the planet perceive to have their future "set", I have hardly seen a more miserable bunch. Every issue that is common to all college students appear intensified a thousand times in the experience of the MIT student, and it seems that because all are so preoccupied with their work, few have any disposition to provide one another with the time required to support each other's mental health; time that comes naturally to university environments with a weaker work ethic. As a mediocre student  at a mediocre university, I hope you all do well and live happy lives. Don't let the pressure you put on yourself do you in.
