I honestly think love is a terrible thing, and brings much more evil into the world than it does good. Sure, people make great sacrifices for their loved ones, but even without love, you still have soldiers in combats facing death every second of their way, and everyday life heroes too who happen to shield a little kid or just another human being they are not related to from a bullet, or save them from a car moving their way. As long as there is a level of decency, and people have brave an kind hearts, we don't need romantic love. Romantic love leaves a lot more people either scarred for life or miserable at least at some point of their lives, and I don't have the stats, but I am sure there are a lot more people suffering from unrequited love than there are people so in love and happy in their relationships.
