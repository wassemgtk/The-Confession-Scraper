I would like to thank my ex boyfriend for a great lesson. Basically, it seems that my main fault was that I was too nice and did everything for him. And now he wants a "strong" girlfriend. That’s fine but why the hell did you keep coming back to me all semester, begging me to take you back, pretending to be nice, while spending a lot of time with a “hardass” girl from your new dorm? I trusted you and took you back because I loved you, it was my excuse. But what was yours for messing with me? You did not tell your friends that you keep coming back, the last time just a few weeks ago, because you knew they would be disgusted with you. But you made me stronger now. And please, don’t try to come back again after you will be kicked out by this “strong” girl pretty soon (“strong” girls usually are not into your cheesy style). And girls, DON’T BE NICE to immature jerks who will only use it against you.
