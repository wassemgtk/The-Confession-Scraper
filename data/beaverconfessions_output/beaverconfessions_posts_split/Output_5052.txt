Today I remembered why I loved Senior Haus in the first place. It's easy to forget, constantly seeing so many cold, spiky exteriors that are just shells hiding all these beautiful people. But it's such a community, with the silverware/food/couch/everything kleptos; we all live together like a family and send out angry/threatening/'stop taking my red sweater get your own and grow up damn it' emails like a dysfunctional family. 
I was reading MIT confessions and I saw the hatred for the Burton-Connor lady and then there was the Senior Haus confession. We lovingly tease our housemaster and AD and house manager; I have yet to see any actual tension arise between residents and the house team (except in the case of Ken meets fire hazard but that's more of a Ken-fire-hazard personal issue) and it's one of the few things that truly make finals week significantly better. 
Seeing the stark contrast between how we feel about our house team and the BC people, how many haus people respond to haus confessions in fun ways, it hits home that the reason I'm still here is because there's no other place that I could imagine being even relatively happy. I'd rather be holed up in my room psetting/studying 80% of the day here than anywhere else because, at the end of the day, yes, it is the most unique place I've ever seen.
