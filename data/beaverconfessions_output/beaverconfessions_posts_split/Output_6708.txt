I started sexting a guy last year. I have never met him, but I know a lot about him. He said he wanted to meet, and I went along with it so we wouldn't stop texting. He is already going to get tested for STDs, and he also requested time off at his job so he can visit me this summer, and I'm freaking out. I don't know if I want to meet him or not, and if I don't, I don't know how to get out of it. He knows a lot about me, and it won't be easy to tell him that every time I encouraged him to think that we would eventually meet was a lie. Sexting with him was so simple, and safe... no STDs, no pregnancy, no hard feelings.
