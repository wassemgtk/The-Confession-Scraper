Redwashing: (n) The use of the term "socialism" to describe policies and traits that are either just examples of social democracy/liberalism or are public services that have absolutely nothing to do with social ownership of the means of production.

Ex: 
Person 1: "The United States is already socialist. If you don't like socialism, that's fine. Just give up your Social Security and Medicare, stop driving on public roads and highways, take your kids out of public schools, never call the police or fire department, and don't use the Postal Service."
Person 2: "Please stop this redwashing nonsense."
