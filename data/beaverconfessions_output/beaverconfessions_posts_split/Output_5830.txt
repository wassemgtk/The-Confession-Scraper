DISCLAIMER: This is a sad post and while I hate posting sad things here since it's about the last thing anyone needs, I kind of just need to vent about this right now, I'm sorry...
I feel like I've only managed to hurt everyone around me, and that the world or at least each of my amazing friends would be so much better off without me. And yet I feel that in spite of all of that they're so amazing and nice that they would feel sad/mad at themselves if I do decide to throw it all away, so that's not really an option either. It feels like a fucking Catch-22 for my friends, and I'm the one unwillingly setting it up, like 'either be friends with someone who's bound to hurt you or end the friendship and be happy again but since you're too nice to actually end a friendship, feel guilty about it.' There's a simple solution to all of this, which is that if I truly cared about them as much as I say/think I do I'd just get up and leave their lives forever. And yet what makes me even worse is that because they mean so much to me, I'm too selfish about having them in my life to actually carry that out. (Although the good thing is in another 1.5 years when I graduate it'd be very easy for me to do that) For those of you still reading, thanks, you're the ones that truly care and the world needs ppl like you. You're probably wondering what the point of this is, and it's really just venting. Especially since I can't vent to my friends, S^3, or Mental about this since they're all too nice to give me real talk and simply go with the standard "you're being too hard on yourself" despite the fact that I've seen myself do this time and time again. Also, if any of my friends read this, well ofc you wouldn't know it's about you since the point of this is anonymity, but I'd just like to say, you're amazing and I'm truly sorry for everything, you deserve better
