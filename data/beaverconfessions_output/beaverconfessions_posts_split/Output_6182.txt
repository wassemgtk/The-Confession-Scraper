A lot of people here were their high school's valedictorian and now they come to a place like MIT and realize that they are no longer the best - they may be below average or maybe even average.  And this makes them feel awful but their friends tell them "you are below average at a top university - you are still above average in a grand sense."  I also see this ALL the time in comments on this page.

While this *may* be true (I don't 100% believe that, after all STEM !> humanities), it just seems to be a super weird thing to say.  Why is your "confidence" based on being better than other people?  Sometimes it is super annoying to work with another MIT student at a company because they often look their noses down at kids from other colleges and they refuse to learn from them.  Like stop.  Stop getting your self worth from being better than other people.  Sometimes you aren't the best.  And that's okay.

I have an older sister who is a freaking prodigy so I had to learn this lesson super young.  I would sometimes say, "she is really, really smart - she gets things faster than me."  And my friends and parents would be so concerned about my self-esteem when I said that.  I later had to explain to them that just because I knew I wasn't better at her at school or at music than her didn't mean I wasn't confident in myself.  A lot of people at my high school didn't see it that way.  They thought the way a lot of you guys think - they got their self-worth from being the best.  And they saw her as a threat.  They told her everyday that she was stupid and basically bullied her.  My sister to this day doesn't realize how smart she is, how she has the freaking Midas Touch all because a few self-conscious people couldn't stand the thought of not being the best.

So how do I get my confidence?  From the knowledge that everyday I am here, I get better than I was yesterday and I test *my* limits.  And my only competition is myself.
