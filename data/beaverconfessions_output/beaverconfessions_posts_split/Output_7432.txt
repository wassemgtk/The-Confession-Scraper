Vagina Monologues in a couple points:
- men are pigs; male-female sex is generally bad
- rape and underage drinking is liberating....but only when it's female on female sex
- why are we asking vagina questions to a six year old?
- vaginas
I am all for feminism, but when these sort of narrow-minded and men-hating plays are sponsored, it becomes a joke.
