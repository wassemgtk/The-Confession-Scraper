I wish I could be single and happy with it. Back in high school, most of my friends were single and all I heard about relationships was the drama. I didn't have an inkling of desire for a romantic relationship, and I was fine with that. Now something like 75% of my floor is in a relationship, along with pretty much my entire friend group. And now being single makes me feel lonely, unwanted, and like I'm missing out on something important.
