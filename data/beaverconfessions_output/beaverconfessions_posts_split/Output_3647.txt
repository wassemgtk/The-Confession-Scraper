@#4795 I have a secret fantasy wherein Trump becomes president and all the leftists move to Canada (notice, never Mexico) as promised. Our economy goes to shit with austerity measures and trickle down economics. Traditional family values once again villify the remainder of the LGBTQ community that hasn't already fled. Whites once again convince themselves that it is normal for them to be at an advantage in many ways and to merely suggest they have this advantage is "being divisive" and "pulling the race card." The government is once again a small affair with the EPA, IRS, CDC, and TSA cut. Hell why not just go the whole way and cut Congress, the Supreme Court, and the President out of it. They don't deserve our taxpayer dollars!! The media is dominated by Fox News and TheBlaze. People stop watching TV and using the Internet and other disgusting leftist implements like cellphones and writing and start communicating via good ole' traditional grunts and the occasional fart for emphasis. Where did original communication values go?? Winning is good again and telling everybody else that they can win if they work hard in our *totally equal* opportunity society is the norm.

This is all possible. Please keep your word and move to Canada. Hell why don't ya'll just move to Europe with the rest of your left leaning friends and join the 7 billion people out there who aren't cool enough to be as conservative as 'Murica is and have to suffer under "free secondary education" and "universal healthcare". Classic leftist mind set to care about the education and health of others.

Don't take anything in this confession seriously, it was an 18.03 study break.
