I'm a senior and I really want the logs to sing to me this V day... Unfortunately, I would feel like too much of a loser if I paid them to do it for myself... T_T Mentioned it to bae, but bae was like: why would you want to sit on some other guy's lap when you have me?

Bae has a point but I'm still salty. I think bae is just being cheap.
