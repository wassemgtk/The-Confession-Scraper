I can't stand the ppl who comment on here judgmentally without even going here, like Francois is cool cause he at least does it in a funny/troll manner but everyone else just gtfo, like I know this is harsh and it's not like I don't think you're cool ppl, I'd love to talk to you outside this context but I like this place as a place of venting and solidarity about just MIT stuff.
