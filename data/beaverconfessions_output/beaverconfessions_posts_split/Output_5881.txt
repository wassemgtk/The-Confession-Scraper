I really struggle with my eating disorder.  Sometimes I feel like its killing me.  I know you're supposed to tell someone, and you're supposed to get help.  But I told one person and I feel like it killed her a little too.  And now my problem's back full-force and I can't handle it, and I don't want it to really kill me
