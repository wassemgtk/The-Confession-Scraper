Why is it so necessary to have faculty that are similar to students? What happened to diversity? We don't have the right to be comfortable, and moreover, unfamiliar perspectives are good for building character and learning about yourself and the world. Of course, if there are truly negative circumstances or unfair treatment, that is unacceptable. But if someone feels discouraged simply because they see nobody like them in their field, I'm sorry, they must not want it enough. Obviously I cannot speak for all minorities, but as one myself, I don't feel a need to be surrounded with people just like me. That's not how we grow.

Have some faith in one another; being of the same race does not guarantee two people will understand each other, and equally so, being from different backgrounds does not mean people cannot understand one another.
