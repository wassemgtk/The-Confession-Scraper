my family knows trump personally. although he may seem impulsive, rash, and abrasive, he is actually quite kind, polite, and considerate in real life. he likes to talk in hyperboles, but his actions are quite carefully carried out. in all honesty, he is a talented man with a lot of passion. i respect him a lot.
