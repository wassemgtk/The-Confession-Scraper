I hate when people say "Get help, there are so many resources available to you" as if these resources are somehow magically going to fix things. I’ve tried so many things and nothing is helping. Talking about it doesn’t help. What am I supposed to say, “I’m really depressed all the time. I stay in my room for days at a time without eating or talking to anyone because I don’t have the energy to get out of bed. I don’t care about anything anymore and haven’t been happy in over a year.” Talking about it only seems to make me focus on it more and make me more miserable, and what’s anyone supposed to say to help anyway? It’s not like any events in my life are making me depressed. I have a great family, great friends, and am at a school I used to love so much. Nothing’s changed except me. But I just feel so alone and irrationally upset all the time and nothing is helping.
