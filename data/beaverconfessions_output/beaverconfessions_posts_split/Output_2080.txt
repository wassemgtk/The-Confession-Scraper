I've been here for two years now, and for some reason, maybe the nice weather outside today as I was walking to class, I stopped and realized what an amazing place I am at, how interesting everything that I am learning is, how amazing everyone here is, and how much fun it is here (when not psetting of course). It truly is an amazing experience going to MIT.
