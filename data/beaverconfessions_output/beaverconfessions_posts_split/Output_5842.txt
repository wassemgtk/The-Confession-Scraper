I want to defend the students here from some harsh accusations and explain their actions.

This video went viral of protesters standing up to a reporter trying to violate their personal space. These protesters have been unfairly represented in the media, they have even reason not to trust them. Now the critics I have heard argued that the tents were on public space and the reporter had the right to be there due to the first amendment. Legally yes, but should he? I think he was being unethical in violating their safe space, away from peering eyes, and he and the rest of the white media, failed to see that. So for that I commend the students for pushing him that that guy with the video camera away, saying that they need their space, and will do what they must to get it, regardless of the law.
