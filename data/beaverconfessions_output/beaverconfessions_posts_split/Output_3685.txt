When I see comments on here like:

“I refuse to believe and MIT student is a Trump supporters, otherwise the admissions committee loses all credibility” 

“Trump's supporters are as much of joke as Trump himself”

“the American people are not dumb enough to elect a racist, bigoted, misogynistic, xenophobic, financially insecure, incompetent, fascist piece of humanoid waste like Trump”

it just renews my support for Trump. People accuse him of arrogance, but don’t they see the irony in their own sneering sense of intellectual and moral superiority? No, I don’t care much for social change, being a caretaker of the world, or unifying, empowering rhetoric. In fact, the more abrasive the rhetoric, the better-- never trust pretty words from a politician.

I care about lower taxes and economic opportunities to help myself and my family. I want this country to assert itself and bully itself back to economic superiority if it has to. When my parents jumped through all the hoops to earn their American citizenships, why should illegals be able to just waltz across the border? How can people deny Islam has more religious extremists than other religions? Lastly, let’s stop the hysteria. Even if you hate his rhetoric, the majority of his positions are very moderate, and the extreme ones will never be anything more than a negotiating starting point at best (an ideological zealot like Bernie wouldn’t get anything passed).
