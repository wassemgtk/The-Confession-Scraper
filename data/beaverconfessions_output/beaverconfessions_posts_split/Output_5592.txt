I know this is a super unpopular opinion for a young, liberal college student to have, but I'm actually pro-death penalty. Although I don't like how it is implemented in the US (i.e. with heavy racial bias), I think that certain heinous crimes such as first-degree murder and forceful rape should be punishable by death (given that the perpetrator(s) is/are absolutely guilty and not mentally ill).
