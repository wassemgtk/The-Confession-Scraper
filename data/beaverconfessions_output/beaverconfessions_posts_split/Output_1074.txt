Finals are actually draining my soul, and making me much more depressed than I have ever been. Everybody seems so happy now that classes are over, but I am super scared because of finals. In my Freshman spring, I failed almost all my finals after studying so hard for them. I am just afraid that it will happen again. Even though I am studying, I keep telling myself what is the point if I'll just fail them all again.
