Do you miss me like I miss you?
Fucked around and got attached to you
Friends can break your heart too, and 
I'm always tired but never of you

If I pulled a you on you, you wouldn't like that shit
I put this reel out, but you wouldn't bite that shit
I type a text but then I nevermind that shit
I got these feelings but you never mind that shit
