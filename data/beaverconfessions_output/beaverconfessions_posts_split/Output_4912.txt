Well, you know what Chris? You didn't even want to go back to your home state to plow the snow. You were too busy campaigning. They had to shame you into going back. So you can't talk to me about leadership, and you certainly can't talk to me about running this country. Our current president has divided us. We need a leader that can unite us. So let's dispel this fiction once and for all that Barack Obama doesn't know what he's doing. He knows exactly what he's doing; he's undergoing a systematic effort to change this country and make America more like the rest of the world. If I'm elected we'll embrace what makes America the greatest country in the world. Furthermore, let's dispel this non-non-fiction finally and for all time, that being Big Barry ain't got no clue how he likes his dick in my ass. He knows exactly where my g-spot is; he's undergoing a systematic effort to ream my ass every night and make it more like Jeb's slutty rear end on behalf of our children, and their children after them. If I'm elected we'll embrace what makes America the gayest, greatest country in the world and have foam bath parties every night, until we finally dispel this notion that Master Barry is dividing this country. He's uniting this country, one plow at a time, plowing butts, not snow, Chris. We need to embrace what makes America the greatest country in the world, that Master B.H.O. knows exactly what he's doing and he has a bigger dick than anything anywhere you can find in the rest of the world. If I'm elected president I will have Barack slide inside my tight Cuban ass every night and make it the greatest ass in the world, one that our children can be proud of.
