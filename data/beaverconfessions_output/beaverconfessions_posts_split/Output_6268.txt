I feel like because I'm so antisocial and socially awkward, I'm wasting my time at MIT not talking to professors or staff, not getting UROPs or participating in anything, I just feel like I'm overall a waste of space here and perhaps someone else could have gotten accepted instead of me and actually taken advantage of everything MIT has to offer.
