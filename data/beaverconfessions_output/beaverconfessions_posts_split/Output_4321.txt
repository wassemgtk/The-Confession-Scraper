I'm still upset that our student government didn't tell us about the freshman housing plans. You guys care and have good intentions, I get it, but this affects all of us. I wish more than a select few knew. How are you supposed to get more ideas for brainstorming, if you keep everything a secret? So, I'm supposed to go to dorm "exec" or DormCon meetings to get my voice heard, but I can't go up to a giant group of people and tell them fuck you for keeping information to yourself. In order to have a voice, we need to be kept updated on important changes. That's what we elected you for. Like you're not the US government. Shit doesn't have to stay top secret in a community of 4000
