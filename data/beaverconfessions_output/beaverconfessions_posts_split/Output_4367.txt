Someone from my dorm runs a food blog, and as someone coming from a low socio-economic background, I find it extraordinarily pretentious to go into a restaurant, order a $15 appetizer and a $25 entree and call it mediocre online on no authority. I lived my entire life until the age of 18 thankful that there was food on the table 4 nights a week, and you're here blowing 30 bucks to call something "devastatingly average."
