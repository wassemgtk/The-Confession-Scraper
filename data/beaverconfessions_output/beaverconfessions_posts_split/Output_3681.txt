While we are on the subject of S^3, I just wanted to take a second to shout out to the 2 deans who I have personally seen - Gerardo Garcia-Rios and James Collins - who have been absolutely amazing, and whom I cannot thank enough for their support. Apparently Dean Collins started out his career studying CS before deciding that he wanted to pursue mental health and counseling, which is cool, and makes him a bit more relatable in my mind. I think you can request a specific dean if you make the appointment in advance, so I totally recommend either of them if you are worried about having a bad experience.. both of them are wonderful and I really felt like they genuinely cared. Also, another shoutout to Evan Heisman for being such a kind and calming person to deal with when setting up appointments. :)
