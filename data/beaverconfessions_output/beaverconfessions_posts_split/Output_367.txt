About three weeks into school, I am officially loaded with bunch of Psets and exams. I have done couple semi-all-nighters and full-all-nighters already, struggling to hand in Psets in time and to understand what the heck is going on in class outside of class. As terrible my weeks have been, I honestly still love this fucking place. I've bonded over stupid 2.001 problems with my friends, got to know so many amazing new people in my new classrooms and dorm, and have already learned so much in my major. I know that MIT can be super stressful and hard, and trust me, I've gone through bad times myself. But at the same time, Pset with friends, take subjects that interest you, and trust that you will get stuff done, and you will hopefully realize that this stressful place is also filled with amazing people and unimaginable opportunities. Props to everyone for surviving these past few weeks and remember that every single one of you make MIT a great place that everyone in the world know it to be :)
