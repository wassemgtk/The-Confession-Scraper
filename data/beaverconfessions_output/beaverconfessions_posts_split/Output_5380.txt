Skin color bothers me. I hate mine. It's white. But I'm not allowed to say that. You can't complain about being privileged. The thing is, I have all the opportunities in the world and I'm wasting them. Half the time I'm too depressed to even do my work, even with the medication. I'm barely getting by, even with all the resources in the world. I sometimes wish I had an awful life where I was discriminated against and had terrible parents... if only someone who deserved it could take my place. That way I wouldn't have to feel guilty on top of everything else. Then I could feel pride in accomplishing anything, rather than despair at not accomplishing enough. I know it's petty, and disgraceful white whining. But when someone comes up to me or posts on facebook about how no one white can understand suffering, it just makes me so mad and guilty at the same time. If we can take racism seriously, why can't we take depression seriously? Why do we get to rally behind the former, but pretend the latter doesn't exist? I'm truly proud of all those succeeding despite discrimination; I only wish we could follow their example and unify, support each other.
