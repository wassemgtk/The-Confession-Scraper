Maybe I'm cynical, and I hate to be showing that side of me but as someone who's literally not turned in psets on time to help out friends, it saddens me how many people here actually prioritize work over friends. I mean yeah there's the whole 'people over p-sets' thing and whatnot and that's a huge step in the positive direction but I still find myself caring a lot more than anyone really cares about me, not like it's a competition and I could care less whether ppl see me as caring or not cause I know where my priorities are. But idk, it'd be nice for people, esp. my so-called 'sisters', to actually think of my feelings/whether I'm okay every once in a while rather than me always checking in on them... But whatever, I'm just saying look around: there are more hurt ppl than you think and it isn't hard to figure that out if you are looking for it
