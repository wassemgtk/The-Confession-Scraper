Does it bother anyone else that all of this Columbus bashing happens on Thanksgiving? I'm not saying Columbus was an asshole and that Native Americans/First Nations people were not massively screwed over by him and others. But Thanksgiving celebrates an apocryphal feast that happened in 1621 between the residents of Plymouth Colony, who coexisted peacefully with the Wampanoag people for 15 years [...before they started expanding and fucking shit up, granted.] So let's not bash Columbus, let's bash the people of the Mayflower, guys! Who's with me?
