I have trouble forming close connections with people, and this makes me incredibly self conscious when I am in a group. Any conversation, any joke, any connection formed by two people that I am not included in makes me feel excluded, as if any interaction I am not involved in is a missed opportunity. I realize that this is ridiculous, but often that recognition is not enough.
