Where can a meet a chill/mellow gay or bi guy? I have tried attending some of the rainbow lounge's events or some parties at EC, but I haven't really found what I'm looking for. The people at those parties and events are very eccentric and loud (not that I have a problem with that, it's just not what I'm looking for). I'm wondering where all the quiet, chill guys are. Am I looking in the wrong places?
