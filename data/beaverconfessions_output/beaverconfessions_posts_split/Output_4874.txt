This past IAP someone from back home told me how much he liked me and it made me realize how stupid I had been to give a fuck about you not wanting me back. Yes, I'll never stop getting butterflies (in both the stomach and other body parts) every time I see you, but I deserve so much better than being your consolation prize.
