All of the Confessions posts about suicidal thoughts make my heart hurt. I still grieve for every victim of suicide during my 4 years here, even though I never knew any of them personally. Please please please if you want to hurt yourself or you feel worthless or overwhelmed, make an appointment at Mental Health. Even if you think your thoughts aren't serious or aren't deserving of someone's time. Do it for me if you won't do it for yourself.
