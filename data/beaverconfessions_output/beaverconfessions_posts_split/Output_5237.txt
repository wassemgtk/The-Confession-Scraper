I was reading about the Paris climate talks and in short it's too late. Climate change is here to stay. Now the next question is what to do about population. Some people say we should stop having kids. Here's the problem other countries won't. Then we will have to fight wars for farmland later to avoid starvation. This requires lots of soldiers. We actually need to make a point to really boost our birthrates now for when we need the kids to literally fight for our survival.
