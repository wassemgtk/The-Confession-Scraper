I have dissociative identity disorder, also known as multiple personality disorder. There's not much understanding out there of what it is, so I've only told one other person. And now all of you, I guess. It's a bit like having different rooms in my head. There are doors between the rooms that open sometimes, and thoughts can occasionally move between them, but each room is its own space, its own personality. Therapy is like trying to realize I am the house. 

So I'm sorry I haven't been on hall much this year. I miss talking to my friends, but I don't know how to be anymore.
