I grew up in an urban area in a conservative state in a family that was indifferent to LGBT issues. With essentially no direct guidance either for or against I took what I thought was the right and decent path, support. I would read about persecution and side on the side of human rights equality and feel pleased with myself that I was on the right side of history. However, I was never exposed to many openly LGBT people in my conservative state and, having been exposed now to those people and the everyday problems they face, I realize that despite best efforts I committed many micro-aggressions and showed a lack of empathy before. I'd like to think that I'm changed now and I'm sure that most people would be satisfied that I had recognized what I was doing wrong and was making active efforts to change my behaviour and be more welcoming, but it bothers me that the nights I spent thinking about what I believed in and trying to be supportive of all people were not enough.
