13,2016-10-23 02:00:27,"I'm a PhD student. With MIT being MIT, I had gotten used to the idea that I'm not particularly smart. But then, the silver lining of this ridiculous election emerged: I'm demonstrably a great deal smarter than Donald Trump (or at least, I'm better at discerning fact from fiction), and if, as the majority of his followers believe, he's smarter or more capable than most Americans are, then by the transitive relation... I just got some of my self-confidence restored.

But for real the rampant misinformation and apparent departure from the sanity of fact makes me want to cry. MIT community, save me. Seek the truth -- the complicated truth (because that's the whole truth). And then help people approach problems like impartial observers -- like scientists, damn it. It's hard to be impartial when it comes to issues in politics, but I trust us to put our collective academic discipline to good use. Because hey, we're MIT. Hard is kind of what we do.

36,2016-10-20 23:00:19,"Let's say every MIT student wishes to be at least average (i.e. aims to score at least marginally better than his peers). If a student is below average, this condition will haunt them and they will increase their time spent studying in order to fulfill this goal. As individuals adjust their work habits to meet or exceed the average, then over time, the average performance/work ethic of students will increase. This will in turn result in standards for ""average"" being raised, and grade cutoffs will over time adjust to be tougher than they were in the past, so MIT will very subtly, over many years, become a more difficult place than it was before. As this process marches on, students will (again, slowly but surely) begin to feel overworked, tired, and subject to harsher expectations. These harsher conditions were not set rationally by any human, but are the result of a social mechanism which works slowly enough to not be obvious to those involved. They will seem ""normal,"" and any individual who does not submit to them will be ""lazy"" or inferior.

After many years, people will start to realize that something isn't exactly right. There will be crisis - momentary collapse - and there will be pushback. Initially, the people in power will move to treat the symptoms of a broken system (more committees! mental health staff!) to quell the feelings of unrest. Things will seem like they are getting better, until another crisis; another tragedy. 

Before long, a consciousness will start to develop. Students will reject the work ethic, and become aware of the absurdity of the system. They will refuse to stand for it, or to believe there is something wrong with them for having the self respect to care for, and enjoy, themselves. Of course, real change cannot be attained by individuals acting alone. As long as the system remains in place, individual dissenters will be stigmatized and crushed by the dominant ideology.

Thus, the only permanent solution to such a system can be mass collective action to overthrow the existing conditions. Though it will require an intricately planned, organized struggle, the fall of the crushing work ethic and the victory of the students are equally inevitable. Let the administration tremble at a revolution. The students have nothing to lose but their chains. They have a world to win.

38,2016-10-20 23:00:21,"Sigh. Just bought another dildo because the current ones redmind me of my abusive ex.

Now I'm just worried about having to explain my big toy collection to the next girl I'm comfortable enough to open up with.

This is one of my most hidden secrets, but as a mostly straight guy, being pegged is one of the most intimate things I can experience. Something kept personal between my partner and I, where I give up that control, and put so much trust in someone else.  Even in the cycle of abuse it was one of the times where I felt most safe and loved.  It's beyond purely physical for me. In fact I usually don't even pay attention to the physical aspect, it's just such an emotional experience for me.  Not even something that I like to do that often, just so impactful when I do.

I don't want to be broken.  I want to trust someone again."

77,2016-10-19 19:00:33,"MIT fucks people up. I really don't think it's worth it. Too many friends have been broken.

Something needs to change, and that needs to be the very essence of MIT. Every mental health measure that's being taken, or being considered, attacks the symptoms not the problem. MIT is the problem."
78,2016-10-19 19:00:35,"I've been feeling very depressed lately - eating like crap, not talking to my friends, skipping classes, coming home late, sleeping too much or too little, failing tests and psets, surfing youtube rather than doing psets. I wake up with anxiety every single day. I have days when I spend the time I should be psetting curled up in my room or in a nearby bathroom having an anxiety attack, holding my head and waiting for the dark voices to go away. Sometimes they don’t. 

People don’t seem to notice this change. Why would they? I haven’t made any friends close enough for me to open up to to care or notice. It’s my fault I’m so alone. Yet, why do I feel so sad about this self-made situation. Maybe I’m just weak. In terms of workload, I have it super easy this semester. I’ve only had one or two quizzes this week for midterms, but my other friends have 3 or 4 midterms and psets together. They must be more stressed out than I am, but they’re handling it better than me. I’m probably just weak.

I know that people keep telling me to seek out friends because ""you can't get through MIT alone,"" but talking to people just seems so entirely worthless. Even if I do talk to people, it'll just feel like I'm being a nuisance to them; they won't really care. People only say that they care, but after you bother them too much, you just become an annoyance.

I already tried going to MIT mental health, but I got the same vibe from them. When I told the psychiatrist that I was feeling sad, they pried for more information and I felt very attacked. Can’t they just listen to what I have to say without getting so worked up about it? I understand that it’s their job to make sure that I’m not in any “immediate danger,” but at the same time, couldn’t they see me as a person rather than as just another patient they need to hurry up and fix? They didn’t even seem to be interested in what I was saying when I was happy - listening and nodding with the same bored and distant eyes as all the other people who said they “cared.” They don’t really care; It’s just their job. When my hour is up, they would just tell me to wrap it up and ask for another appointment time. If I can't even open up to the psychiatrist without being judged and possibly sent to a mental hospital for the slightest misstep, who else can I trust? After a few weeks, I just feigned happiness and never went back again to mental health again.

Now I’m more depressed than ever. It’s so hard just getting through every single day. Who am I living for? What am I living for? What’s the point anymore? I don’t know what to do. I can’t ask MIT Mental Health help because they’ll just send me to a mental hospital. I can’t talk to friends because they honestly don’t care and will just find my constant depression annoying. I can’t tell my family because I don’t want them to worry. I’m not doing well with any of my psets, tests, or obligations because I can’t concentrate. But at this rate, it’s so hard to just keep living through every single day with a fake mask of happiness. When is it all going to be over..."

168,2016-10-10 07:00:35,"Dear #8269, [trigger warning]
I remember the first time I ever cut myself. I was 15, a sophomore in high school. I kept doing it, off and on, through the rest of high school, through freshman year at MIT, through my medical withdrawal, and even after my readmission. I'm not sure if I'm in a position to help, since I still struggle with controlling my urge to self-harm, but I felt like I had to say something. I'm sorry that I am anonymously posting this so I can't tell you to reach out to me. This isn't a story I'm ready to have connected with my name on a public website.
Like some comments said, it's not that your friends don't care, it's that they don't know what to say. I had friends that actively tried to get me to stop, but it was only a handful of them, after I'd admitted it to them first. Most don't know what to say beyond ""you really shouldn't be doing that"" but you know that already, even if you don't believe it.
Others simply don't notice. For people who don't self-harm, it's not the first thought that comes to mind when they see cuts and scars. Without sounding abrasive, realistically, how many bodies/arms do you actively look at every day?
I thought I was strong enough to keep it under control. I thought I could stop at one cut. I wasn't. One day, I escalated. I had over 50 cuts on my arm when I was admitted to the hospital. Looking back, I know I could've died.
Please, seek help. Go to MIT Medical. Open up to your friends. Tell your GRTs. Then, they'll know to watch out for it, and they'll know to support you. Don't expect them to read your mind and your body. Doing that will only add to the cycle of bad thoughts that eat at your self-worth.
Love,
Someone who's felt that way before"
169,2016-10-10 07:00:38,"K. So my past came to haunt me, this week.  I was making progress with this chick. Like real progress. I'm sure she was interested in me and I was interested in her. Even though we live many dorms apart and are constantly busy, our connection stayed strong. So I asked her out one day and she initially said yes but cancelled coz she allegedly had something planned that day. I asked her what had come up and she didn't respond.  Said hi to her in a lecture and she responded coldly to me. Turn's out she's in the same sorority as this other girl from my rather recent past - let's call this girl Y. So I liked Y but Y liked someone else - this rather douchey frat boy. So I reacted badly to this so I went agro on her, said some shit I should not have said and, in gen, erred on my part. I should have handled it better. So I tried to recocile things with Y - said sorry in chain texts, tried to chat with her but Y was having none of it. I'm so sure that I weirded her out. Y and I are over as friends,  acquaintances or anything in gen. She's enjoying her life with douchey-bon-douche (I constantly meet Y with bon douche) and well that's good for her. So I moved on, got a new girl in my horizons and never looked back. Unfortunately, girl 1 and Y are friendly to each other. She mentioned me in a sentence and Y told her everything (I verified with girl 1's friends - it's still a miracle how I even got an answer). Dear Y - I know that you were looking out for 1 but I also wanted to move on with a girl I REALLY LOVE. I wouldn't have treated her like I did to you. Fuck you, Y. Fuck you. I really liked her, for God's sake!!"

171,2016-10-06 21:00:41,"I have been developing a theory but I'm afraid of the backlash my thoughts might receive, so I have opted to test the waters through MIT Confessions. I am a straight white woman, and these are my opinions.

I believe that gender is binary. I believe people can be trans, but I do not believe in the fluidity of gender. That's not to say you can't claim to be gender fluid, and I can't tell you what to say or how to feel about your gender. But at the same time I cannot be forced to call you 'xer' or 'them.'

Here's the meat of the idea: The issue of transgenderism isn't new, and the concept that gender is a social construct is also not new, both of which I agree with. However there is no inbetween. Due to the nature of biological sex, there are only two 'mental sexes' or genders. Your gender and biological sex can coincide, or not coincide, but there are only two of each (outside of extremely rare cases of hermaphroditism, which is an edge case).

The advent of being genderfluid is, as best I can gather, a result of globalism and the internet age. As teens grew into adults in the days before the internet, they found their place among their friends and in society based on the small group of people with whom they associated. In the age of the internet, teenagers are finding that they aren't so unique afterall, having been exposed to the opinions of people across the world every day via internet blogs and social media. As a result, the fragile ego of the rising adult causes a scramble for identity. Ultimately, the person clings to something to be different. This is equivalent to being goth in the 90s and early 2000's.

Thanks for your thoughtful responses."

I've seen them have it-- when they got sick, their parents sent them soup. When they wanted to buy their brass rats, they got loans from their parents. When their boyfriend/girlfriends broke their hearts, they talked it through with their parents. I mean, like I'm happy they're independent and have grown out of needing their family, but I never got to grow out of needing my family. I took care of my parents, not really the other way around, and it bums me out sometimes. 

I'd give anything to know what it's like to call your mom at the end of the day and talk about school and life and the cute guy that I'm crushing on in my morning class, and to have the conversation end in an ""I love you, no matter what anyone tells you, you're doing great.""

But a lot of times it feels like talking to an echo chamber.  A friend told me that MIT is apathetic because politics isn't something that really affects upper-middle class STEM professionals in a noticable way.  But we don't live in a vacuum as much as this page suggests.  I really want to believe that not as many people act apathetic because they really don't care but because they don't know how or why to care. If there are more opportunities to get involved and people understand how the system can create change in our lives then maybe people will also pay more attention.  Whether its funding research, better healthcare, better STEM education, more opportunities and jobs, or just being able to feel like you have a say in the system that structures your life, politics isn't this just a thing that loud overly opinionated people do. It's a way of engaging your community and making it better for everyone.  You can register to vote, help people register, get involved with MIT Democrats, Republicans, whatever you stand for, generally read news, learn about how things in Cambridge change and get changed, whatever it is you want to do to feel engaged.  It's a wonderful feeling and I wish I more people around me had it."

197,2016-10-06 20:00:33,"I hate that I get sick every time I eat, that I can't risk eating breakfast or lunch before an exam. I hate that I can't sleep, that when I do sleep, I wake up gasping in fear every hour. I hate that I can't talk to anyone about my childhood, because I was raised not to talk about or show pain, and even with all the stupid things I've done at college, the only things I have regretted were days where I was vulnerable. I hate that I can't tell anyone how I feel, that I have to suffer alone. I hate that I know that I don't have to suffer alone but my fear and pride are too great to get help. I hate that I'm adopted. I hate that my best friend tried to kill herself. I hate that I can't kill myself, because every time I think about it, I remember that awful knot in my stomach when the phone call came, the way that nothing felt real. I hate that when I was in fifth grade I was afraid to love anyone because every time I had loved someone, they left me or died, and I thought I was cursed. I hate that I was verbally and physically abused by someone who was supposed to love me. I hate that every time I tried to leave he threatened me. I hate that he would force me to kiss him in public. I hate that I don't feel bad when I broke his heart. I hate that people won't leave me the fuck alone. I hate that I cry alone at night. I hate that no one who reads this will even think about me as they read it.

But I also love. I love the way that even without knowing any of this my friends will stand by me. I love the way they come visit me randomly and let me crash in their rooms without question. I love that I have someone to talk to if I ever overcome my fears. I love the way my friends hug me and laugh with me. I love the way no one ever tells me I'm unwanted anymore. I love the way I can feel sexy, happy, and fun without feeling guilty. I love that people like me, with or without my scars."

375,2016-09-22 00:00:31,"I know that the concept of an SJW has been around for years, but I've only heard about them as of last year. Since then though, they've been flooding my feeds every day and I think they're threatening to actually drive me mad. Ever since I was little I've always been a bit of a contrarian: if someone raises an outspoken opinion, a small voice in my head usually counters with ""No they don't!"", but for SJW related stuff the voice's been especially loud. At first the contrarian voice was funny and I didn't really pay any attention to it, but after a while I found myself starting to think everything it told me to. This is really bad, since all of the SJW-negated thoughts are pretty unsavory in nature and I always thought of myself as a good person.

Recently the voice's been getting louder and louder and worse and worse: sometimes if I read/watch an especially strongly worded essay/video I get a pretty bad headache and need to clutch at my head for a bit as the voice goes to town on my sensibilities. At this point it's kind of obvious something is wrong so I'm trying to block out all of the SJW posts from my Facebook feed (which is really hard since I like to read every last bit of garbage on the internet, and Facebook thinks I like looking at that stuff), but for every one I block out another one pops up. I also considered abstaining from Facebook (my main source of interaction with the outside world) entirely but I still need it for schoolwork and occasional collaboration.

tl;dr initially it was a joke that SJWs were ruining my life but it seems like it's actually coming true and I think I'm turning into a bad person because of it. I'm not sure if this makes sense but maybe my brain's already jumped the cliff and I've already gone mad: I have a PSet due in a couple of hours and tons of other things due shortly afterwards that I didn't start and I'm still thinking that the SJWs are out to get me.

What should I do?"

I've heard some people say in certain cases, what's the big deal if the person is terminally ill or depressed? The big deal is suicide, doesn't just hurt the person who does it, it mentally destroys their loved ones. It hurt me and their other loved ones deeply. To think that the individual was in so much pain that they couldn't bear to live for us shatters you inside. You want to scream at the top of your lungs and ask why couldn't you reach out and ask for help and you knew we would have all done anything for you? Was life with you not worth it for them? But they can no longer answer. Suicide leaves great anguish for those who have to live through it. It's a selfish act of cowards. Dying is easy, living is hard. I've been asked how I feel about the people I know who did it. Nothing will ever stop me from loving them. I choose to love and not hate them, because I don't want my anger about the end to rule me. But, I don't mince words on their wrongs either."

465,2016-09-11 01:00:31,"I want to share a little story about a lesson I learned. The other day I was in my room and my roommates and I were about to go get dinner in 15 minutes. So I thought I would have a little fun in the meantime. So I hit up my favorite porn site and get to work. It's then I realize, I'm out of lube. I decide to substitute water. So I'm about to finish, and fellows, you know how towards the end you really start speeding up. Unfortunately the water caused my hand to hydroplane off my dick and smashed into the monitor, cracking it, and cutting my knuckles, blood dripping down my hand. Here's the dialog that ensued.

Me: ""YAAAUUUUGGGHHHH!""
Roommate1: ""What happened?!""
Me: ""Nothing!""
Roommmate1: ""That doesn't sound like nothing, come on lets get dinner.""
Me: ""Sure, just got to bandage my hand.""
Roommate2: ""Dude, you just hydroplaned off your dick and smashed up your hand! I knew you would do this again!""
Me: ""No I didn't! And fuck you!""
Roommate2: ""If I come in, are you saying your monitor won't be cracked, and covered in blood and cum?""
Me: ""Alright fine I did! You happy?!""
Roommate1: ""Just clean up and get out here.""

The moral of this story is don't use water as a lubricant for masturbation, as hydroplaning off your dick is no laughing matter."

489,2016-09-05 23:01:22,"I was a big Bernie supporter this election and I liked what he brought to the table. There is one issue I need to bring up that I think some of the supporters were not getting. I felt that the mentality was wrong. America is a very individualistic society with individualistic sacrifices and benefits such as lower taxes for lower benefits. Northern Europe has a communal mentality, everyone pays more in taxes for more benefits. The issue I had with many of the other Bernie supporters was how they assumed they would get communal benefits, but with no communal sacrifice. For example, everyone was on board with the idea of socialized healthcare and universal free public college, but not paying for it themselves. Here's the reality, the wealthy in this nation hold about 1.5 trillion in assets. To expand college and healthcare in that manner, it would cost 2 - 3 trillion extra in the national budget. We could rob the rich blind and still come up short. In most Northern European countries the average person pays 50% in taxes, in the US it's about 28% - 30% for the average person. Most of the other Bernie supporters I talked to assumed ""the rich"" would pay for everything. The reality is we will all have to pay a lot more in taxes, we will get a lot more in exchange, however. And for those of you who argue that we just need to raise corporate taxes, every single country in Europe has lower corporate tax rates, then we do. We can't raise them any more. My point is, if you love Bernie's ideas, but aren't willing to pay a lot more in taxes yourself, take a hike, because you really aren't for his ideas, you are a left wing tourist, who loves the fun, but doesn't want to make the effort."

Gorillas are known to attack humans if they feel threatened and there was sufficient evidence from Harambe's behavior that he was agitated by the onlookers and was violent with the poor child, and there is absolutely no guarantee the child would have been safe by the end of the ordeal. Killing the animal rather than sedating it with a dart was probably not the best idea, but given the situation (and the likelihood that darts do not always work), and the extreme risk to that child's life it was totally justified."

I spent my first two years dealing with depression and anxiety, and as a result, I didn't join many clubs and really regret it now. I don't have many close friends in college, as I also lost contact with many acquaintances and general friends during that period. I really don't know how to meet and get to know more people. I feel like people found their set friend groups already, and I don't want/know how to awkwardly try to insert myself into one, but I always feel so lonely at school and don't know what to do about it. I know it's a minor thing, but I've always hated eating alone at the dining hall (which happens a lot), and I feel like such a friendless loser. I've been dreading coming back to school the entire summer. Advice please?"

I thought i would be able to get to know someone in college, but all of my closer friends have still always been girls. I've found it incredibly hard to bring it up to them, since most of them are in happy relationships - I'm happy for them, but it makes me feel even more like a freak. I don't think I'm ugly or anything - just shy and insecure. I am genuinely lost on how to even begin making more guy friends. It also seems like many people came into college with high school sweethearts and/or met people during their first semester/year, and I'm worried that I'll seem like even more of an anomaly. :("

523,2016-09-02 13:00:27,"Sigh. Honestly, I want to punch someone whenever I hear DON'T VOTE. When you don't vote, you are letting politicians know that you don't care about what they do. Voting is our way of showing them ""Don't fuck with our tax money. It's not yours. It's for us. Also, do your fucking job."" At the end of the day, their bosses (more like should be) us, citizens. When you vote, you are telling them you are watching. Without YOUR vote, they can't get anywhere. 

But I also understand that you feel frustrated because I felt and still feel exactly like that. It's hard to keep up with politics when you have so many things on your hand. Also, thinking about voting critically is good, but please just please don't give up. It's a country YOU live in. If you really think voting for a candidate is stupid, at least just show up. Don't vote but still register, so they know that there are people out there who care but can't make a decision for whatever reason. That will at least help to bring up an issue that there's something wrong with politics. If people don't care about what goes on in your country, history repeatedly tells us, there's no bright future."

530,2016-08-30 18:00:39,"Why has it suddenly become okay to assume that if Person A accused Person B of raping them, Person B must be guilty? When did ""guilty until proven innocent"" become okay when it comes to sexual assault? I know that for some people, it takes a lot of courage and time before they're ready to report the incident, and that the probability of the offender being convicted decreases as time goes by. And I know that it can be difficult to prove ""beyond a reasonable doubt"" that the assault did take place. But now we live in a world where if I, as a guy, say all this, I'm a misogynist who doesn't want to take the word of a woman who says she was raped.
Does this really make any sense, guys? Do you realize how fucked it is to skew your judgment this much for a particular crime? Does it really make sense to arraign/convict someone of sexual assault just because someone who may or may not have actually been a victim says so?"

532,2016-08-30 18:00:50,"I took to studying some economics and politics this summer in light of the election and it dawned on me. I have no honest idea of how our economy fully works, and a shrewd, but not fantastic idea of how our political system works. I should not vote on something I don't comprehend. Is it my right? Yes. It's also my right not to vote. I know some people get very upset at this idea and say we should all vote, but should we? If a man was having a heart attack and I ran up to him on the street and his wife turned to me and asked if I was a doctor and I said no, but I'll still try to save him. She would angrily say get back and call a real doctor, not, ""Thanks! I'm so glad you care!"" Perhaps we should apply the same logic towards politics. Because of this I am choosing not to vote this year. In the last election I just voted for the guy I liked and his party down the line with no idea of what he actually wanted to do in office, which in hindsight was very stupid. Some people would argue that almost everyone falls into this category so I should just go vote anyway. Two wrongs don't make a right, and the enemy of my enemy is not my friend. I'm not going to do something stupid because everyone else is. So my advice to everyone is this. If you really don't know anything about politics or economics, please don't vote, you are not helping, you are only a part of the problem. And don't do it because your activist friends push you to do it."

I will be working in China for a few years, and he will be studying in Korea. Realistically speaking, we know that a relationship would never work out and that we'll probably never be together. There is a good chance we'll eventually grow apart due to the geographical distance. It just hurts knowing that I never clicked with someone as much as I do with him.

You can do a great job and still be told that you need to go, simply because the economy is slowing down or the company is struggling, or there is a change in strategy. Life isn't always fair. What we need to do is to hold tight and do whatever we can. As long as there is no regret, there is nothing to complain about. Best of luck!"
595,2016-05-29 02:55:54,"My first year at MIT has been weird. This is really the first time I've found myself struggling to manage school, work, or just life in general. People sometimes say that going to MIT is like drinking from a firehose, and I certainly felt that way; there were rarely moments when I didn't feel busy and way too many moments when I felt overwhelmed with commitments. There were times when I just didn't feel like getting up, going to class, or doing anything, and I didn't. There were times when it felt like nothing was going my way and there wasn't anything I could do about it. And there were times when I just stopped giving a shit.

Yet after all of that, I'm immensely grateful for my time here. I've had my share of unfortunate events, but for every one of those, I've had many more great experiences. I'm so thankful for all of my wonderful friends for helping me get through a difficult year. I feel like I've learned so much about myself, and I think I've started to figure things out, if only a little bit. I've come to realize that making the most out of MIT doesn't mean working 24/7. It's about knowing when friends are more important than work, being there for your friends when they need it, and having friends who will be there for you when you need it. We're incredibly lucky to go to a place with such amazing people.

Looking forward to the next three years. It's been real."

First, he blatantly lies to students, faculty and staff. He says one thing to you one day, then something else to someone else the next. He preaches about how much he is into 'ethics' and 'honesty', but he is one of the most political and devious members of the MIT community. Over my time at MIT, I could write a book with the litany of times he has done this (but I will not be specific here, elsewise it would be identifying, and he is kind of in charge of the Office of Student Citizenship and I KNOW he would be reactionary).

Second, he is never direct and upfront. He is always round-about, passive-aggressive and never to the point. Maybe this ties into that dishonesty bit above. It is so damn hard to hammer him down to one viewpoint on anything.

Third, he has a very narrow, moralistic (and hypocritical, in light of the above) way of seeing the world and is absolutely unwilling to change it, no matter what anyone else says or what the community needs. I would be fine with this if he was just any person, but for someone who actually helps make policy at MIT, and is involved in the future of student's lives, it is absolutely unacceptable for someone to not be open to new ideas or even question their own. ESPECIALLY AT MIT!!! Like what the hell?

Fourth, CAN HE SERIOUSLY STOP BEING SO TWO-FACED WITH THE FSILG COMMUNITY??? ""Oh, yes, you can do that..."" ""Oh, nevermind, no you can't, and now you're in trouble..."" ""Oh, well, that's true for everyone else, but for YOU, no, no you can't do that...""

Fifth, I have NEVER MET SOMEONE who is LESS SELF-REFLECTIVE in my ENTIRE LIFE. If you were to ask Kevin about himself, or how effective he is in his job, or how effective the OSC is, according to him - everything is perfect! Everyone ELSE is wrong and messed up. These things you hear? Bad policies? Bad experiences? Simply fringe. We won't change. I'm perfect, everything I do is perfect, everyone else just needs to conform to MY standards. Talk about a lack of community-mindedness.

We need someone who runs the Office of Student Citizenship who lives up to the MIT values of honesty, integrity, and who looks out for the good of our community, not the good of their own self or world. That person is not Kevin Kraft.

I ended up passing the class (I never felt so happy to see a C on my transcript in my life) and just want to know how well I did on the final. Thanks guys.

I hate being judged for it. While I've been here, people have told me I'm not ""x"" enough, pestered me about what percentage minority I actually am, (and when I explain my skin is white because of colonization some 200 years ago, say ""oh, well, you're not really x then""). So my family's 200 years in that country doesn't matter? The fact that I grew up celebrating, cooking, dressing in that culture like my grandparents before me doesn't matter? All of the sudden I'm appropriating my own culture, I have no right to act like I'm ""x"" because I'm not a real minority. Look, I get that being fair means I have had a different set of privileges, that I don't face the discrimination people who actually look like minorities do, and there are experiences they have that I have had the fortune not to have shared, but that does not mean I'm any less ""x"" than you are. It doesn't mean I don't have a right to identify with and celebrate my culture, without being judged for being fake or appropriating or whatever."

And now that Unified is being split into four separate classes, I'm even more salty. When I was in unified, I told myself I wouldn't be the kid that wanted sophomores to suffer just because I had, but now I do. It's a right of passage, and this new way they're doing it is going to be WAY easier. Where's the course 16 suffering??

I had friends who were either extremely lazy and demotivated or extremely narcissistic. Were they friends? Not really. They just gave me some space in their lives. I got really bad grades as a freshman. Then a senior and I got talking in the reading room. He helped me understand my goals. He helped me motivate myself and told me, 'Dude you have like three years to buckle up. Work your ass off and you will be in heaven for the rest of your life.' I don't know about the rest of my life, but currently I am in heaven. I started my research in my sophomore year and found my girlfriend right after. She wasn't the one I wasted my freshman year on. The one I got wasted on has has four boyfriends already and denies each one of them, just to get PSETS done by the boys. What a sucker. So glad I got my lovely girl.

I even took time out of my work day to phone call him!

""Trump is Love"" I say, ""Trump is life."" My dad hears me and calls me a racist. I knew he was jealous of my devotion for Donald Trump. I call him a cunt. He slaps me and sends me to bed. I'm crying now, and my face hurts. I feel a warmth approach me. It was Donald Trump. I'm so happy. He whispers in my ear ""We need to build a wall."" He then gets me out of bed and reaches in his pocket. I'm ready. I open my wallet for Donald. He gives me a small loan of a million dollars. It hurts so much, but I do it for Donald. I feel my wallet tearing as he puts the money in. He roars a mighty roar, as he fills up my wallet. My dad walks in. Donald Trump looks him straight in the eye and says ""You're fired."" Trump leaves through my window. Trump is love. Trump is life."

730,2016-05-20 02:02:24,"Feeling kinda bittersweet about soon never again being an MIT undergraduate student. 

Like we shit our pants when we read that “Congratulations, you’ve been accepted into…” email. And we came here and found other intelligent motherfuckers with other passions, talents and abilities. We busted our asses most nights to finish psets, knowing that one day it would all be over and we would have in our possession a piece of paper certifying our completion in a given department’s criteria. We partied our asses off Friday and/or Saturday nights only to be frantically working all of Sunday. We made or did things that we didn’t know we were capable of making, despite how short coming we may have felt. We influenced and defined our immediate communities.

And now you want us to just leave, after all the crying, sweating, and bitching we have put into this school. After all the shitty PBR and Rolling Rock that was consumed at awkward but crazy parties. After all the team all-nighters we have pulled getting a robot to move or code to run. I know my experiences may not speak for everyone’s but we will never exactly have these exact experiences again. We most likely won’t ever be surrounded by as many intelligent people ever again. And we most likely won’t stay up getting something to work as if our life depended on it (exaggerating).

I feel like the most painful part of my life is almost over, but I don’t know if the most painful part of my life will end up being the best part of my life."

I'm not asking this to make a point, I'm just genuinely confused and wanted to see what the reasons are that it's wrong. I don't have any strong opinions on it, but to me it just seems that because illegal immigrants are ""illegal,"" deportation isn't morally or legally wrong. I just feel like inherent with the word ""illegal"" is the idea that they're legally not allowed to be here, so what's wrong with making them leave? In fact, because illegal immigrants are, by definition, illegal, wouldn't it be wrong not deport them? Personally, if I were an illegal immigrant about to be deported I would feel awful, and I totally get that it's morally messed up to uproot someone like that, but it doesn't make sense to me how kicking out someone who legally doesn't belong somewhere is a problem.

854,2016-05-19 02:11:28,"So I was told that the ""freshman 15"" meant that you gained 15 pounds from going to college, without even thinking about it. Meanwhile, I lost about 15 pounds freshman year, plus another ~10 pounds since then (despite gaining some weight back over the summer when I went to the bay area for an internship). I have not been consciously dieting in any way; I still eat at all the free food events, I still keep fruit roll ups and Cheez-its as snacks, and I don't do any sports. 

I think there has been some benefit to all the extra walking I do here as compared with the suburb I used to live in. But most of all, I think I just forget to eat. All I need is a dorm without a dining hall, a terrible sleep schedule, and a lot of work on my plate, and *poof* I can just eat way less and not even notice any hunger from it. Turns out it's really easy to forget about lunch when you wake up and have breakfast at noon, for instance. 

I'm eating fewer calories, but I'm also having only 1-2 meals a day, so I don't think I'm particularly healthier or less healthy than before. Similarly, I've noticed several really skinny guys who completely avoid fruits and vegetables, and who instead have a diet consisting mostly of soda, pizza, and Mexican food. I don't even know how that works. 

Anyway though, I just want to say that having been overweight and now being in a normal weight range, the idea that the latter is automatically healthier or a work of improved willpower is bullshit. I see a lot of people, especially on reddit comment sections for an image involving a fat person, pat themselves on the back for their weight management skills and for being such healthy responsible people. And maybe some actually are, but I'd be willing to bet that most of them are just a product of their environment. I think that questions like ""Is your city a walking city or a driving city?"", ""Is food easily accessible for you throughout the day?"", and ""Does your schedule have regular times for eating 3 meals a day?"" are often way more important for determining weight than ""Are you a responsible person who eats healthy food?"""

936,2016-05-17 02:19:19,"Listen. Wake up. I am a junior and working hard in MIT since my sophomore year. Freshman year was a total disaster. I fell for an innocent baby faced girl and she kept looping me around only to use me for her PSETS. We are here for us not for those girls who live in some kind of bubble. Make yourself super powerful in whatever you do. Go out alone and run around Briggs. You don't need people to feel better. Remember in a few years they will go their way and you would go yours. All you will have is a good body and mind, a family (like mine who pay my bills and give me full support) and now a girl really likes me. I am biding my time to talk to her. No more mistakes any more. Stop the hate posts and share more love, you will love more people and get some back."
937,2016-05-17 02:09:20,Breaking the November rule was one of the best decisions I made at MIT. Being in a relationship with an upperclassman gave me a lot of perspective that I wouldn't have had otherwise and kept me sane.

949,2016-05-17 02:36:38,"One day Edison's class teacher came to his home and handed his Mom a letter. Tears rolled down her eyes as she read it. When he asked about the letter, she replied that it said ""Edison is a brilliant kid in school, please take him to a better school. He deserves a good teacher."" Edison believed her as he couldn't read at that time. 
Years after becoming a successful scientist, when he opened the box that contained his late mother's belongings, he found that letter. He quickly read it. Tears rolled down his eyes. The letter said ""We are sorry to inform you that your child has poor learning. He may not be able to pass this class. Please find a special school for him."""

I've been around MIT and Cambridge a while but I've never heard of an oobleck pool being made somewhere on campus or elsewhere around town. Not that I heard about many undergrad things necessarily and grad groups always tried to convince ppl to be real grownups and go to classical music concerts and stuff instead of actually fun things...

So....does anyone ever make oobleck pools large enough to attempt running across on campus? And how does one find out when and where?"

Then I accidentally used it at Dunkin the same day and it worked, no problem. I tried my luck at Verde’s and no problem. I called to check my balance on the gift card and I have no money left. I’ve been using it at Verde’s for the last 3 days and every now and then it won’t work and I use another card but if I go to the right cashiers they don’t give a fuck. They get this confused look, push some buttons frantically, and tell me to have a good day.

I was having lots of trouble with my 2.72 team project due to depression, and he allowed for me to work on an individual project. And even when I had trouble with this project as well, he's been nothing but patient. Once, he even allowed me to just sit in his office and work on the project while he worked on his own stuff, and let me ask really dumb questions if I needed too.

He's the sort of engineer/teacher I aspire to be in the future. I'd highly recommend taking his class if you can."

What I wonder though, and this is unrelated, is why is criticism of Israel so often flagged as anti-Semitism? 

I know that like any group of people, the Jewish and Israeli people cannot be generalized and stereotyped, and that like the rest of us, they're just humans trying to do well in life. (As are Arabs, Palestinians, Muslims, and literally everyone...) I don't have a problem with the people.

The policies and actions of the Israeli government however, I do have a problem with.

How can someone express their opposition to the actions of Israel's *government* without being called anti-Semitic? Are there certain words they need to use or ones they need to avoid?

I don't buy the argument out there that criticism of Israel is inherently anti-Semitic. Labeling political scrutiny as religious discrimination is a cheap way of silencing opposition."

1078,2016-05-14 22:23:59,"Sometimes I find it so startling to think that, barring finals week, 1 of my 4 years here is over. Not gonna lie, when I first got here I was really scared that this first year wasn't gonna go too well. I was prepared to get utterly torched by all my classes and as a person with Asperger's Syndrome, don't even get me started on what I thought about making friends I could trust. Looking back, I wish I could have reassured past me that my fears were baseless. Sure, I may not be the best in my classes, but this is MIT and I'm getting the job done. We have the brightest people on the planet here and each one of us is brilliant in our own way. As for the friends thing, I think I've truly found a wonderful group of people here and for all they've done for me this year, they deserve shoutouts for their awesomeness. So here we go.

A shoutout and many thanks to:

Yun Chang- A great neighbor and a wonderful friend. You're always willing to help with any questions I may have regarding academic material and somehow you manage to put up with my craziness every day. We've shared many a good laugh and I hope there's many more in the years ahead.

Quint Hester- One of the nicest and most trustworthy people I've ever met. Period. In everything we've worked on together this year, I thank you for tolerance of my shenanigans and for helping me understand things that I didn't get on the first go around. I may not be a Course 16, but I hope we can work together again.

Lorenzo Vigano- I always thought it would be hard to find an upperclassman friend but you destroyed that notion very quickly. I really appreciate how open and supportive you are and I'm so glad I can count on you as someone to turn to should I need. 

Joe Taglic- You're certainly not just any Average Joe. In fact, I think you're quite the Awesome Joe. Thank you for helping me when I needed it and for all the good times we spent together this year, even if it was just letting me hang out with you and Lorenzo. Also, thank you for getting me into the wild ride that is the NHL. Come on Isles!

Brandon Wang- What's it gonna be? 6? 16? 1? 12? Either way, even if you travel the road of Course 6 digits, I'm proud to call you a good friend that I can count on. Bernie Sanders is proud of you too. 

Alan Cheng- Thanks for being the ultimate Smash homie and a great guy to be around. May you continue to waveshine and show the world the truth of 20XX.

Domenic Nutile- Us MD boyz gotta stick together and that we did. Thanks for all the good times, support, the $20 ;), and for just being an epic dude no matter what. If you wanna go to Xanadu again this summer, hit me up.

Joe Griffin-I always had a blast hanging out with you this year, be it in conversation or over the Wii U. Best of luck and may you find success in your future!

Laura Koemmpel- Thank you for being such a kind soul and soothing presence as well as an epic groupmate.

Alicia Ouyang- Surprised? I bet you are. But you are the person I've known the longest that's at MIT so of course I'm giving you a shoutout. That and I also enjoyed our conversations this year, even if they were few. Keep being awesome Alicia! (If you could reach the top shelf for some Jolly Ranchers, that would be nice too.)

Nithin Buduma- Thank you for providing me with a healthy daily dose of snarkiness as well as for having good taste in being a part of the Pats Nation. Stay awesome and never change mate. 

Emma Kerwin- Mo' money, mo' problems. I really should put a South Park reference here but if I tried such a thing, I'm gonna have a bad time. Thanks for being a really chill person to be around and for all the funny moments this year.

Anthony Colangeli- I salute the 6 God of the elevator lounge. Thanks for being a total bro and making sure it's always lit fam.

Bill Peebles- If I was going to get you a gift, it would be 1989, but I feel like you have it already as a part of your shrine to Taylor Swift. Oh well. Thanks for helping grind out the psets and creating the fun that is observing the Hillary vs Bernie debates you have with Brandon.

David Rosales- One of the first people I met here and still one of the coolest people I've met here. Save the Humans is just the first of many achievements you'll have here.

Joe Iosue- I know for a fact that there's a 99.9999999999% chance you'll never read this but I'm still going to take the time to say that you're a fantastic guy and I like how you keep it real.

Henry (""the Ambassador"") La Soya- You're a wonderful guy to be around with a great taste in music. Thanks for introducing me to the wonderful ball of fun that is Coup. I hope you enjoy ZBT next year!

Johnny Crawford- It's a real shame I didn't get to know you sooner this year, because you're a pretty cool guy. I look forward to working with you next semester!

Carlos Cuevas, Felipe de Quesada, Paulo Heredia, Simon Zheng and Ishan Meswani- You five are fine footballers and wonderful people. I'm glad to have played the beautiful game alongside you this year.

Lucy Yang and Miguel Young- Thank you for all of the good times this year with the Pokemon League and the opportunity to be a part of the leadership. This is just the beginning!

Nolan O'Brien, Amy Vanderhout, Charlie Garcia, Jose Rosa, Or Oppenheimer, Andrew Adams, Caralyn Cutlip, Piper Sigrest, Liza Gaylord, Nicole Zatorski and Alexa Jaeger- You all are wonderful people with a kind heart (Liza will probably object to this), and you all have created a warm, welcoming environment that has made me feel comfortable living here. This means quite a lot to me so these thanks come from the bottom of my heart.

Again, thank you to everyone listed here for making my first year at MIT a great one."

Like, no, it's not OK to give me shit at the door (or around campus!!) because I denied you entrance to my private residence after we reached capacity. Please appreciate that the reason we stop letting people in is a fucking matter of safety, not because we don't like you.

I'm genuinely sorry that you happened to be the person that would have put us over capacity, but srsly, in case of a fire, we need to be able to get everyone outside asap, we just can't do that if we let too many people in and we have to cut off somewhere."

We had strong, supportive families that valued education and made many sacrifices for it.  Our invitation to MIT meant our years of hard work were finally recognized. Most admissions applications mentioned the strong bonds between MIT parents and students. As an MIT mom, I was the person who always believed my student could succeed even when they doubted themselves. The emotional turbulence at MIT is not limited to students. My confession and that of many MIT moms I know is how painful it is to spend almost two decades giving so much more than the parents around us only to find out that on Mother’s Day our students that we were once so close to, either barely acknowledged us or forgot us altogether.

As an eldest son, tradition demanded that I stepped in to fend for my younger ones.
I grew taking take care of others, always putting their needs before mine.

This responsibility made me mature way earlier than my peers. I grew up thinking about
long term consequences of my actions, and how the consequences will affect my family...

Do you know what it fucking means to have been a household head by age 15 tho? The pressure. Good lord. Do you know what it fucking means for people to always come to you with their problems, expecting a miracle? Shit. You have four MIT finals, but just received a call about sending money for grandpa’s funeral...

I’ve been a Lone Ranger for as far as I can recall. It’s brought me the good and the bad.
The good in the sense that it drove me to succeed. The bad in the sense that I find it hard
to connect with people emotionally, and even worse, romantically. Ask my ex.

1222,2016-05-12 02:55:50,"Dear #7208, if you openly admit to hating on bioengineers and electrical engineers, then you don't get to call yourself an engineer either. If anything, teamwork is the most crucial aspect of engineering. And frankly, I do not see how a despicable envious degenerate contemptible imbecilic coward -like yourself- would ever be able to work effectively in a real team on cutting-edge research that require the integration of people from different disciplines. As an aspiring engineer, I hope I never get to experience the embarrassment of sharing the title with you. 

Now on course 20 hatred. I believe it is ultimate jealousy. I bet you couldn't stand the rate at which bioengineers are making history. I bet it bothers you so badly that just two days ago, your facebook feed was overflowing with articles about Robert Langer, a bioengineer, and his new polymer that might turn wrinkles into history. 

The only thing worse than your manners is your logic. You cannot possibly survive course 20 at MIT if you despise math, mechanics, design etc. It is just not worth the GPA drop, and certainly not worth the near-mental state you reach when you are forced to learn both the biology and engineering cores and perform actual research at a lab that is not your bed. 

I do not know how to reply to your course 6 bashing. If course 20 is relatively new and is deserving of a lengthy explanation for simple-minded people like yourself, course 6 is not, and I refuse to elaborate on why  I think it makes you seem like a world-class unreservedly pathetic douche."

It wasn't a ""regretted sex"" situation. It was a full on he grabbed me and tried to do things with me and I tried to fight him off and said no over and over situation. Both situations were similar, except the first was in public surrounded by other people in this fraternity. No one bothered to intervene and some made jokes about it. Neither person apologized or said anything about it after. I've come to terms with what happened to me I guess, but I'm scared that this could happen to someone else that steps foot in this place.

Unfortunnately, I know that she doesn't love me and never will. She's always flirting with other guys around me and she recently went on a date with one of the guys she's eyeing.

1278,2016-05-10 21:26:35,MIT has to up their game when it comes to international students coz the way they treat us us shitty. I'm an upperclassman double majoring in course 6 and 15 and have an almost perfect gpa (4.96) yet i've been denied many opportunities. I participated in f/asip and upop and got nothing. I even got denied from having a misti opportunity based in my own country. A professor denied me of a urop twice coz i wasn't 'american enough' and i reported him; still no reply from mit's admin about the case. I was also told that my essays had 'a foreign style' by one of my writing class teachers and i overheard an MIT ISO official laugh with his colleague about my accent. I don't get why you MIT employees discriminate us like that. The MIT students have been very supportive to us internationals. Almost all American citizens orignate from a place outside America. America is the son of all nations. So why all the hate and discrimination?

Hillary Clinton is definitely the most qualified Democratic candidate to protect the interests of American imperialism. Sure, Bernie Sanders certainly does try, such as with his support of drone warfare, but he just doesn't seem as committed. There's no heart, no conviction. I'm sorry to say, but the old Brooklynite just does not have the stomach to orchestrate something like a Latin American coup. How can he be president if he will refuse to partake in such a time-honored American tradition? As a proud American patriot, I must in good conscience endorse Hillary Clinton for president, for she is the only one who can maintain the level of cold-blooded terror that the United States of America is known for."

I'm about five pounds overweight, and I can't stop obsessing over that number. I look in the mirror and see a fat blob. I would like to lose fat. I try and eat about 1000 calories a day, and usually freak out if I go over that number. The problem is, after about a week of great willpower, I binge and eat a ton of junk food. Usually this only brings me to maintenance at ~2000 calories, but I always feel terrible about it. 

I've lost a few pounds already and that made me really happy, but I feel like I'm not going about this in a healthy way. There's no way 1000 calories is a healthy number.

I don't know if you're aware but racism, misogyny and sexual assault are real problems that destroy lives. People preventing you from going into their private residence is not racism or sexism. People standing in your way as you try and punch your way past them is not sexual assault. Throwing a tantrum when you don't get your own way is pathetic - dragging the entire fight for justice for victims of these crimes into the dirt with you is despicable. You're an embarrassment."

1480,2016-05-07 20:35:24,"My ex-boyfriend has an annoying habit of checking in how I am doing once in a year or so  at a random time, probably, because I had a mistake to break up politely ""let's be just friends from now on"" manner. It has been already a week I have not opened his FB message, and I would literally do anything else in this life than open it. Being in love with math myself, I used to godify this math genius for 4 years in my high-school and college, and seek his approval of quite a lot of my life and career decisions. Now, I am scared in case he does not approve or make fun of something I am doing now, although otherwise I am  confident in my career choices. 

2 years ago I met my fantastic boyfriend whom I hope to create family with.  Answering my ex's question about my private life makes me uncomfortable. Lying feels bad. Acknowledging the fact that 
there is someone more important for me now than he used to be, and disproving something we both used to belief, and my own ""I love you"" words feels bad.

 I wish him all best from the bottom of my heart, and I proudly preserved the ability of being sincerely happy for all his successes which he deserves. However, I wish never ever hear from him anymore. Don't know how to tell him this in a polite way."

1483,2016-05-07 20:35:27,"When I was 16 years old I was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. So for 8 years of my life I had to endure some of the most extreme pain. I don't like talking to many people about my illness because it's upsetting how I cannot describe what it was like. If I had a choice between going to live in guantanamo bay or having a severe psychotic episode I would choose the first one. Once I had a psychotic episode so severe I was very suicidal but I was so messed up that I wasn't even aware that I was suicidal. I lost my own dad as a child to suicide so during this time of my life when I was severely psychotic I was thinking of my dad's suicide every second of the day, like what he said to me on his last phone call with me and such. I could hear his last words inside my head over and over. I could not sleep for days due to paranoia and thought that everyone was trying to get me to kill myself. I could not cry at all during this time because my brain was so fucked up all I could feel was horrible anger and chemicals burning my brain. I had horrible heart pains and it felt like a giant claw was wrapped around my brain. It hurt so bad. People say you can't die by mental illness besides suicide but that is not true you can die if you are subjected to enough psychological stress as it affects your body and heart. Everything I saw around me had a black tint and people's teeth looked like fangs. The world was a dark sadistic place. People always sounded like they were screaming at me. The worst feeling was that I was trapped inside my own brain and I thought I would be trapped for life and it made me angry to see all the normal healthy people around me who would go on to live normal happy lives after I time when I thought I could no longer continue and would kill myself. Sorry I just wanted to share because sometimes people talk about mental illness like it's no big deal but it is everyone experiences the world differently."

1486,2016-05-07 20:04:32,"Honestly it's pretty eerie to hear about the racism MIT has.
As a junior this place has been getting consecutively worse.
And I'm not saying that as some jaded upperclassman.
Even before I got to MIT Bexley was already being demolished.
Another community destroyed.

Then my freshman year the whole Phi Sig incident effectively killed the social scene here. Every Friday and Saturday there were tons of people having fun and making memories. You can still do that-anywhere. But MIT was known literally all over the United States for its parties and now they're nothing compared to before.
(Don't believe me ask an alumni)

Meanwhile in the dorms, the security issue has made everyone less comfortable in their own dorms. For some reason MIT administration is pretending that outsourcing the job made security instantly better than their own in-house security.
And in case that didn't work then now everyone has to swipe their cards and now they are guests list. Guys, let's not pretend that a guest list is going to stop someone intent on seriously hurting someone. All it does is make us less comfortable in our own homes or rather ""homes"" now.

And for the students themselves I've seen a re-occurring trend of students studying their major only for a job. Not a job they like. Not a job they don't mind doing. I mean people spending 4 years here studying skmething they don't even like to a get job they don't even want. 
Then on the other side of the spectrum you have students who have such tunnel vision that they don't even care about the world. They're fine developing robotics and AI without considering the real world consequences of doing such a world characterized by Big Brother levels of surveillance and Hyper-Corporatism that exploits human beings against one another in the job market for profit. 

Those people may not understand just how serious the gravity of this situation is 
But all I can say...the Harvard bridge is falling down."

Which is rather unfortunate for me because he's gay, but if he weren't I think we'd make the perfect couple, is it wrong that I feel like this? Maybe I should bury my feelings til we graduate soon..."

1491,2016-05-07 20:01:41,"Recently I've been seeing these passive-aggressive signs around campus encouraging people not to tap when entering a dorm to avoid the consequences of letting others in behind you who don't tap, and they really annoy me. MIT students (myself included) don't like hassle, and we seem hard-wired to find the loophole to get out of restrictions the administration try to enforce. But I think security should one of the few areas in which we should follow the rules for the greater good. As an undergrad, I used to be part of the dorm security discussion, especially after dorms and FSILGs were being robbed too frequently. Security was bad before tapping and Allied Barton, and there is definitely room for improvement now. Instead of posting signs encouraging people to make their home away from home even less secure in protest, be part of a productive discussion to design a system that allows you as students to keep your dorms safe while not being inconvenienced."

Hillary is a moderate Democrat is Bernie is very leftist. It is my understanding that when taking on an extremely far off the spectrum candidate like Trump, most Americans gravitate towards the moderate one. If Bernie gets the nomination, the huge number of moderate Republicans that have been turned off by Trump will have a very hard time choosing between candidates. If Hillary gets the nomination, seems to be a much easier choice."

I sometimes wish that I were dead, but I could never actually kill myself since I'm too scared. I don't have actual depression and it's kind of terrible of me to consider myself depressed when some people actually are and it's really bad for them. I also don't want to go talk to anyone about it since I don't have actual problems and I don't want to be told that I should just get over the small problems that I get upset about, since I know that already.

1752,2016-05-04 23:36:26,"After through analysis, I've concluded that handicapped bathrooms are just perfect for a quick wank on campus. First, I like loud porn, and in a locked, handicapped bathroom there is no risk of anyone walking in on or potentially hearing porn through my headphones. In fact, I can play the video without any headphones using my laptop speakers, reducing the potential of annoying headphone wires interrupting my session. In addition, there are diaper changing tables that you can place your laptop on, so you can sit on the toilet and have a wank without dealing with shit quality mobile streams, or having to try and balance your laptop on your knees while wanking. Finally, there is always an abundance of tissues, soap, and hot water to clean up after you're done. What more could you need?"

1763,2016-05-04 23:58:51,"I think we should be updating the good samaritan policy to treat drugs and alcohol the same, in that we punish students for both. we're at one of the best schools in the world and people need to be taking that more seriously, not getting high or wasted all the time. So we should be punishing people who drink as well as who do drugs. It's unbecoming of people to drink to blackout or anywhere near it, and we have a duty to report others who do it as well as police ourselves. I don't get why nobody understands this, especially in the greek system. I find it abhorrent that my sisters think it's ok to get wasted on the weekends, and that we let in people who clearly party too much. Sororities are supposed to be about improving us as people, not drinking, doing drugs and partying.

He'll walk into a room or join a conversation and greet us with the colloquialism ""what's gucci?"" but with an unexpected twist: he won't say the ""i"" sound at the end of ""gucci.""  Yes, he begins conversations with ""what's gooch?""
Obviously this leaves me somewhat conflicted and confused.  Is he asking a question for clarification, essentially seeking the answer to what IS a gooch?  Maybe he is unaware of the sheer gravity of what he's saying, and is unwittingly uttering the name of a very important but usually unexplored part of the body.  Or perhaps he knows, but is making the sacrifice in credibility to maintain brevity in conversation.  I'm not sure, and I may never know, but he's a good guy all the same."

1872,2016-05-01 22:35:26,"I know every department has its quirks, but I have to say the course 10 department has a special place in my heart for treating its undergrad students like complete garbage. I know we're not producing research like the grad students but my goodness..we exist and are human beings too. 

example 1: department holiday party annually scheduled at the most inconvenient, impossible, and stressful time for undergrad students (the one day we have to study for finals)

example 2: department cookouts scheduled in early August when the majority of undergrads have not returned to campus. 

example 3: minimal licensing options for undergrads whereas grad students get access to the server filled with any program you can think of. All us undergrads get is a computer lab filled with not enough computers for students in one class/enough computers that work/enough computers that actually have the needed software downloaded/enough computers that have internet connection.

example 4: the notorious credit system where ICE modules are worth 4 and 8 units, 10.32 is worth 6 units, 10.37 is worth 9 units. In reality, all of us course 10s know this is complete bullshit for a representation of the number of hours. I know this is the same thing for many other departments as well. At least grad classes are worth 12 minimum. 

example 5: the most disrespectful professors I have met at MIT that make students cry, bully them, and cannot for the life of them teach/mentor well. There are exceptions, however they are few. I am not sure if these same professors treat their grad students like shit as well.

So far, I have talked to people that got 2 of their last choices, someone who didn't get anything at all, others who got 3-4 of their top choices that happened to be unpopular, and still others who got 2-3 of their top choices that were extremely popular. And then there's people like me who got only one option that was ranked as their first choice. 
I'm happy with what I got, I just think it is extremely unfair that there is a person who didn't get anything at all when there was an elite minority that got 2-3 of their top choices that were also extremely popular. It's also an odd coincidence that many of these people are in the committee/friends with the committee members. 
I know there was corruption last year with friends of the committee getting their top choices, but at least the 2015s made sure that everyone got something (so far that I know). This is unacceptable. And I know the committee is going to try to cover their asses and say it's fair but at the end of the day it is what it is. 

I hope they gave that person something in the end."

1889,2016-05-01 22:25:10,"I'm really just feeling like a piece of garbage today. This has been my worst semester academically by far and I have no one to blame but myself. 

I'll probably do fine in 3/4 of my classes, but in that 4th one I think I'm royally fucked. I say 'think', because I honestly have no idea where I stand in that class. I pretty much haven't been to lecture in over a month besides to take a midterm, I skipped both the lectures where the midterms were returned, and the grades were never posted online (not like I just can't see my score, but like there isn't even a spot in the gradebook for the midterm grades) so I don't even know what my score was on either midterm. I've done astoundingly mediocre on the psets overall, and even if I do well on the remaining ones I can still only get about half of the points that could have possibly been earned from psets. And it's all totally my fault. 

Besides the lectures I had to miss to be able to finish work for other classes on time (which is still the result of my own procrastination, but is at least justifiable in the moment), there was no reason for me to miss any lectures. Not that I would have paid much attention anyways, and not that it would have helped that much since (for me at least) the lectures in the first half of the semester were all disorganized, rarely helped me on the psets at all, and mostly just left me frustrated and confused. But it still would have been better to at least go. 

The vast majority of points I've missed on psets have been the result of just not answering questions, either because I procrastinated for so long that there wasn't enough time, or because I was so lazy and discouraged by how little the questions seemed to have to do with anything we talked about in lecture that I just couldn't bring myself to actually put in the effort to figure out how to answer them. 

I should have taken advantage of sophomore exploratory, but I know that realistically that would have almost certainly resulted in me just giving up on the class immediately. I should have talked to the professor before drop date to find out if I was still in a position to pass the class, but I didn't want to go through the embarrassment that discussion would have entailed since it's a small class and the professor knows I haven't been coming to lecture (and the professor has demonstrated himself to be somewhat of a total cunt, so I doubt he would have made it any easier for me). 

And now I don't know what to do. I just feel like such a fuck up. Not to humblebrag (since it's not something worth bragging about at all), but I could very realistically be doing great here. If you consider how poor my study habits have been, how much I've procrastinated, and how little effort I've put in to academics since coming here, it's a miracle that I haven't failed every class. I've actually even done pretty well overall, but that just means that I could probably have close to a 5.0 if I had actually tried anywhere near as hard as I did in high school. But still somehow my awareness of this idiotic behavior has yet to actually influence me to behave differently. 

I guess I could go to S^3, although I don't see how there's anything we could talk about that would actually help me now. I could try to petition to drop the class after drop date, but who knows if that would even work, and who knows if I'm actually even failing (I mean isn't a 50% like a B in a lot of classes after the curve or whatever?). I could make some excuses about depression and issues with my medication, but it seems a little late for that, and I'm not sure what good it would do anyways. I wouldn't be lying, and I'm sure those issues had some impact on my poor schoolwork, but ultimately I was just being lazy. And it's not like I deserve any sympathy from the professor. I can't use the old ""Even though I did poorly, I still tried my hardest and did all the work, so how can you FAIL me?"" argument, because I very clearly didn't try my hardest, and I didn't do all the work.

I'm sure that in the grand scheme of things it doesn't really matter, but it still feels shitty. Not because I have any ego-related issues with getting a bad grade, but because I know I was capable of doing better and still just didn't. But anyways, that's it for my bitchy, self-pitying rant. I'm sure this is of little interest to most, but hey, at least it's actually kind of a confession and not just some angry political diatribe."

1898,2016-05-01 22:06:21,"More real talk: I am a male research staff at MIT and I find many of the geeky female undergrads really sexy. But I have always refrained from literally any non-professional interaction with them because it would be, well, unprofessional, and possibly creepy, and a fireable offense, etc. In fact, when a couple of students flirted with me, I thought it better to ignore it, especially because they studied/worked in my department.

That said, I am sure that there are a few undergrads that have the complementary fantasy to mine (dating a smart man 10 years their senior) somewhere at MIT, studying in courses that are very far from my department, so that it would be sort-of ok to date them. 

How do I meet them? How do I recognize if they're interested? Note that I don't have any problem/inhibition chatting women up, take them out, etc.; what I am trying to avoid is to make advances towards students who would be very uncomfortable. It doesn't help that I like the very shy and reserved ones...

1899,2016-05-01 22:55:22,"Squirrel Man here… looks like some of my confession got cut off. The worst part of all of this is how these squirrels have been affecting my love life. Last year, I finally mustered the courage to ask out this girl I had liked for a long time. We went to a fancy restaurant and had a wonderful time. Afterwards, we went to get ice cream. While we were in line, she started going on and on about how pecans are the best topping and how she never enjoys ice cream when she forgets to ask for pecans. I’m rather open minded, so I asked for pecans on mine as well (I mean, why not). We walked to a nearby park and sat down on a park bench. We began to eat our ice cream and holy shit, she was so right… the pecans were fucking delicious. So I told her how much I liked the pecans. Then she accidentally spilled some ice cream on her shoes. She put her ice cream down between us and leaned down to wipe her shoes with a napkin. While she was leaning down to clean them, out of nowhere, this fat squirrel scurried up between us on the bench. I tried to shoe it away but instead it ate the pecans… By the time she got back up, it had scurried off… She had this look of disgust on her face and all of a sudden it was clear to me that she thought that I had so enjoyed the pecans on my ice cream, that I stole hers. I tried to explain to her that in fact a squirrel, not me, had taken them. Needless to say, we didn’t have second date… This other time, I was at a party and really hitting it off with a girl. I talked to her for probably an hour when I realized that I really needed to pee. I so badly did not want to go to the bathroom and risk not finding her again at the party, so I decided to hold it. Alas, I could hold it no longer and ran off to the bathroom. After I went, I realized that I was getting sort of warm and so, on seeing the back door next to the bathroom, I decided to go outside to get some fresh air. After a minute or so, I decided I was ready — ready to go back in there and ask that girl out. I turned around only to find a squirrel blocking the door. Unlike other squirrels, this one was excessively jittery and poised to charge me down… a potentially rabid squirrel. I was fed up. Jeez, not again… So I spread my arms wide and tried to look as much like an eagle as possible to scare it away. It started moving towards me… accelerating… I lost my shit and ran away. I got two blocks away from the party. I was about to go back to the party when I realized I was only one block away from my room. Meh.

I used to attract girls, now all I get are squirrels."

1907,2016-05-01 22:41:33,Is it generally accepted that if one is looking to take classes they really like across majors that they'll have to take classes with overlapping lectures at some point during their time at MIT? I don't want to do that but above all else want to take the courses that I want to take while I'm here and am curious how others manage it

I don't feel quite so loving as I used to, and the words ""fuck you"" come to my lips so easily. I'm not as openly kind anymore. I wonder if I'm still kind at all. I wonder if in getting over her I barricaded myself against emotions and attachment? I wonder"
1915,2016-05-01 22:36:54,"Every semester I've been here I've gotten an email from a concerned professor about my performance. This year both times it happened I just got really annoyed, even though I know they mean well. I've accepted that I'm a C student, because MIT forced me to. I recently switched to the flexible version of my major with a HASS minor so I wouldn't have to take hard classes anymore, but even now on 36 units of easy classes, even with all that extra time to commit to individual classes and the lack of sleep deprivation, I'm still getting that email. But it's still so much better than how it used to be, when I tried to be a normal MIT student taking a normal 48 units while taking all the classes required for my major. I worked my ass off, got lots of help, went to office hours, went to S3, never slept, went to Mental Health and got a prescription for Adderall, generally did everything right and then some, and still barely passed my classes, assuming you count a D as passing. It sucked. Maybe if I went back to that lifestyle on my lighter courseload I could be an A-B student, but I was so fucking miserable, and it's not worth it. If a low GPA is the price for my sanity, I'll take it. My blood pressure dropped almost 30 points from near-hypertension levels back to pre-MIT levels when I made that transition. I refuse to go back.

But I still have to meet with my professor to talk about how to fix my apparently problematic grades, which was a shock because I was enjoying that class. For the first time I was understanding what I was learning in a technical class, and I got full credit on some pset and exam problems, which is also a first. This professor is so much nicer than other professors too. I'm so used to being treated with contempt by professors, but he treats me with respect and it's such a shock. I don't know what to tell him. Usually the message I get from these meetings is, ""just get higher scores."" Guess I just have to grin and bear it like always and flounder my way to graduation.

IHTFP is not a cute little thing with double meaning for me. I genuinely, deeply, hate this fucking place."

1919,2016-05-01 22:04:10,"DON'T GO SAILING AT MIT'S SAILING PAVILION IF YOU THINK YOU NEED JUST EVEN A TEENY BIT OF HELP TO SAIL. My friend had taken sailing last semester and I'm taking it right now, and we thought it would be fun to go to sail since the weather has gotten warmer. Since it's been a while since she sailed and I only had sailed two times before, we of course made a few mistakes and had a few questions while rigging, especially when our boat didn't have the ball at the end to secure the back of the sail with. We watched the video that was put up, but obviously a 5 minute video isn't going to guarantee you know how to do everything. The guy there got all blustery and said, ""I'm not an instructor, you guys should know how to do this, here let me just do everything"" and when my friend said she was a little hazy since she took sailing last semester and the guy said ""THAT'S NO EXCUSE"" and continued to mutter under his breath as he worked around our boat, and said forcefully what he was doing like he wished us to disappear. 
I get that the sailing pavilion gets a lot of people who want to sail who might need help and there's not enough staff to do that and they have other things to do, but we didn't have to be treated like we had no right to be there.
On that note, are any of the sailing instructors ever at the sailing pavilion to help when not during sailing classes? I want to go sailing on my own outside of class again to just practice and enjoy sailing because I'm a hands-on learner versus a video learner, but now I'm pretty reluctant to go if there aren't people who are willing to be at least a little patient with me while I try to remember how to sail on top of the MIT workload. Sailing was supposed to be a destressor at MIT for me and remind there's life outside of academics, but now it seems like another feature of the hellhole MIT sometimes looks like."

1925,2016-04-30 01:23:17,"There is something I have been meaning to get off my chest for a while now… I am pretty sure I emit squirrel pheromones. It all started sophomore year when the room I moved into had a hole in the bug screen covering the window. I like to leave the window open and one day I woke up with a squirrel on my leg. I lost my shit and freaked out. The squirrel freaked out too, scratched my leg and jumped out the window. I spent the next week getting tested for rabies and, thankfully, wasn’t infected. From that point forward, I always kept my window shut. But still every few days, I would wake up and see a squirrel scurrying back and forth across my window sill or pressed up against the glass… I started to get a little spooked. Months went by without any change. One evening, it was raining hard and getting really humid in my room, so I opened the window. I had two problem sets due at midnight which I was scrambling to do as per usual. Then I suddenly remembered I was late for choir practice, which I had completely forgotten, and I rushed out of my room… forgetting to close the window… I came back to a foul stench — the smell of animal faeces. I looked around the room, and saw little brown spheres everywhere. There was one on my pillow, on my bedsheets, on my laptop, several near the open window, a few on my chair and one on my pset. There was also a splosh of yellow next to the window. I spent the night finishing my work standing up. I also looked it up later, apparently squirrels like to move around when they do their business, which explains how this squirrel hit up so many things in my room. I finally decided to get the bug screen replaced and kept my window shut for the rest of the now spring semester. The day I was moving out of that room, I decided to open the window (why not, right). My mom had finally given me the moon cakes my relatives had sent for me. I went to the bathroom and when I came back, there was a new hole in the bug screen, my moon cakes had been opened, smashed to bits and partially eaten… that fucker. In the fall of my junior year, I moved to a new room and I thought I would finally be free of these squirrels… but no. Every week or so, I would wake up to a squirrel at my window. One time when I was at home showering in my attic, a squirrel was staring me down from my skylight… Sometimes, when I’m in library, I see squirrels glaring at me through the window. What the hell eh? Was I some squirrel god in my previous life?… Am I Kate Upton, but for squirrels?… Or am I a superhero? Like Ant Man, but Squirrel Man."

I keep telling her that I usually miss photo-ops by chance or that no one was taking pictures because I don't want to tell her that I hate how my body looks so much that I avoid being seen on camera. This kind of thing goes against everything she taught me growing up but I just can't get over my self-consciousness. Usually I just end up staying in my room alone.

 “I love you.”
 But then, I would wake up. I would then remember that it has been a year since we’ve last spoken. Time has a way of twisting memories into moments that appear so vividly close and heartbreakingly distant. It wasn’t too long ago when I would bring food for us to share in the library and tease you about your silly mannerisms. The way you would quirkily put your pen over your lips, pretending it was a mustache. The way you would gently punch my arm as you pretended to be offended whenever I jokingly mimicked your mannerisms. The way you would ask the people sitting nearby to take photos of us as we made the most ridiculous faces."

Is it important to call you something? I don't think I've ever been particularly offended even when I've been mistaken as a girl when I was a kid. Is it offensive to call someone who is biologically a female a female? Like if I say ""Sir, you dropped your wallet"" will you be slightly annoyed?

1984,2016-04-29 02:55:16,"So I just read that the US may start forcing women to register for the draft and I think that's fucked up on many levels. The idea is that if women want the same rights as men then we should serve along side men. And I realize that the draft is rarely used but this is isn't even about equal rights and using that as the reason behind this is fucked up. If it was really about equality, then the military officials deciding this and pushing for this bill should not be mostly men. And frankly if the military can't even ensure the safety of women in combat now, specifically when it comes to sexual assault, what do you think is going to happen if women are forced to be there? 

I am personally very anti-war and think no one should have to register for the draft regardless of sex. But if this is really going to be about equality, then I want the same men that think it is right to send women off to kill others and/or die to give me and other women the rights we actually deserve. Rights like full access to birth control, feminine products (without a pink tax), equal pay, and the right to decide what to do with my own body without the influence of government.

I get that a lot of people may agree with this bill and I'm not ""anti-America"" for disagreeing with it. I just think it's wrong to use women's rights and equality as an excuse to force people to serve the military, especially when the military is not the only (or often even the best way) to serve your country. These men don't actually care about women's rights. If they did they would have done more about sexual assault in the military and other women's rights issues in the US.

I'm just irritated now. It's late, I'm tired, and what I read just made me really angry so I probably did not develop my points as well as I should have or even used the most proper and/or accurate terms, so I guess you can say this was more of an angry rant. I'll do more research on this later but I just wanted to blow off some steam right now."

Meanwhile, leftists masquerade as ""radicals"" and ""activists."" Here's a newsflash. It's not difficult when the system is 100% by your side. It's not difficult when the media offers you positive attention every day and readily accepts your narrative as truth. As you hurtle our nation towards regressive destruction, think on this: You're no longer against the system. You're part of it. It's not edgy, it's not risky, it's not cool. You're not the hippies anymore, and it's not new. The real rebels are demonized. We have to wear masks. You don't. WE face our careers ending on a daily basis for refusing to accept your lies and pseudo-righteousness. You don't. WE have to sit through your diversity talks and gender supremacist presentations, and WE get called nazis when we speak up. So who is really oppressed? 

Things are starting to change. You can see it in Europe, and you can see it here. You've brought it upon yourselves, and people are beginning to wonder why they've been asleep so long. People are starting to say ""I am a national socialist, a fascist, a nationalist, an authoritarian, an unspeakable...and I'm proud of it!""

2112,2016-04-28 02:29:26,"to #6284 - I think it's important to realize that MIT is a very large institution, and that these changes to security, dining plan policy, and fossil free MIT thing are not something that happen overnight. It took MIT over 3 years to make Add/Drop forms be online.  It still hasn't done this for minor forms.  If that takes at least 3 years then even considering a change to any of the things you listed will take well over that amount of time.  In a way, it is discouraging. But I think the better way to think about it is that the world won't change overnight either - it should be a lesson of perseverance and determination to enact change and not get discouraged if it takes a really long time.  

To be clear though, I'm not justifying MIT's slowness to change. I'm against huge bureaucracies for this reason. I'm also not a fan of saying at least we're more progressive than the Ivies where it takes even longer to change things. We shouldn't compare ourselves to anyone we should just do the shit that needs to be done."
2113,2016-04-28 02:17:27,did anyone else notice that the drama level of dildo.io went up exponentially when it started to include west campus? Coincidence? I think not...
2114,2016-04-28 02:09:28,"Ok I understand that every dorm has their own superiority complex...but is it just me or does Simmons have an unusually high one? Most of my friends who live there refuse to leave, insist that it is the best place ever for x reasons, and then bash other dorms. Having lived in Simmons I can say that it's a very average college dorm that happens to have been designed very impractically by some hot shot architect. I normally am ok with accepting each dorm's quirks, but this huge superiority complex really irritates me because the people who I thought were my friends spend all their time talking about Simmons and how they refuse to hang out anywhere else. Does anyone else have this problem?"
2115,2016-04-28 02:59:31,"Ok maybe I'm missing something but did anyone actually give a shit about the name Housemaster? Because right now I'm 100% convinced that the only reason MIT even bothered to ""look into it"" was because Harvard ""looked into it"" and changed their name from Housemaster to Faculty Deans. It's not that I care what the actual name is.  I care about the fact that we have all been complaining about how many other MORE IMPORTANT issues and MIT decided to ""investigate"" this one??? Are you kidding me? 

""investigate""/""look into"" = forming a committee to meet multiple times over food paid for by your college tuition with other budgeted items they thought necessary for this ""pressing issue""

But again maybe I'm missing something. Maybe people were actually really upset about calling someone their Housemaster or being called Housemaster. Even though I've never referred to any of my Housemasters as ""Hey Housemaster!"" but instead by their actual names."

My father works in construction, and he wakes up at 4 am every day and works long hours. But you spoiled little pieces of shit don't think about the workers that wake up super early, working in the cold, the rain, on weekends, etc., that you're complaining about. You just think about how you're losing sleep at 10 in the morning. And let's be real, you probably lose more sleep by watching Netflix until 3 am than by being awoken to construction. But you can't blame somebody else for the former, can you? I'm sure this will be received negatively, but fuck it, I don't care. Just realize you sound like privileged assholes."

I think it is a good way to start talking to people, but unfortunately you /do/ still have to do much of the work of communicating what you want and, of course, pinging the person/people you match with to see if they are interested in A Thing.  If you want to talk more, I made a gmail (dildo.io.mit@gmail.com) with the caveat that I /do/ live in a culturally East Side dorm so my experience may be different from yours.

2129,2016-04-28 02:38:10,"Re: active consent again:
(1) Yes, not all girls want to be asked all the time, but some girls (like me) really appreciate it, so please don't imply that because of those who don't, guys shouldn't ask anyone. Get to know your partner.
(2) There are ways to make asking for consent really hot and it's really not that hard. Whispering ""do you want it"" in their ear, teasing them, etc... not only is it asking but you make the sex better for everyone with a little tension building, and with communication, sexy or not.
(3) The reason active consent is so important is because some people don't really look for implicit consent, i.e. will ignore clear intoxication, resistant body language, etc, and there are a variety of reasons why the person might be too afraid or unable to say no unless directly asked. Yes, not everyone is like that, but it's still the case that this is a problem for some people, and you make everyone feel safer and more appreciated by asking for active consent. And when the girl feels safer she will be more likely to let loose ;) I know this is long but I have had guys ask me about this so hopefully those that care will read it."

It comes out in everything, from the way this person handles money to the way this person has sex, but especially in the way this person treats people. I feel like I shouldn't care about this person's character because my objective is a sexual relationship and not a romantic one with feels. But I'm afraid that people will misconstrue things if I do break it off for good. After all, I wanted a physical reward and not an emotional one, so why should this person's character matter?"

2208,2016-04-27 03:46:35,"I have a friend who was upset over some of the new trans bills regarding bathrooms, he went on and on about how ""you can't actually change sex, you have a y chromosome, you can't make a real vagina on a man with a penis, it's just a cosmetic surgery to give the appearance of one."" And he went on and on about poor science, I'm trying to explain to him that he's missing the big picture. When enough people believe something, it becomes accepted as orthodoxy and whether or not it's actually true becomes irrelevant, especially when people want to believe it's true. Take for example, Galileo, he claimed the earth is not the center of the universe. He foolishly messed with the most powerful organizations saying this and really messed up his life in the process. Was he right? Yes. Was it worth it? No. He spent his life being considered a sore loser because he couldn't keep his mouth shut over one little astronomy detail. My point is, if you don't agree with the ideas behind the trans rights movement or question the science behind it, for your own sake shut up. The rest of us accept it, we do not care what facts come out from now on, we will accept it, and speaking your mind is legal, but it may still have consequences."

Honestly, if a guy kept asking my consent, I would be so turned off I would kick him out. Women around here need to learn how to take some responsibility. It's not a man's job to speak up for you. It's yours. Barring rape, there's no excuse to blame men for not ""asking enough"" if you're not expressing any other feelings. And men, you don't have to choose to date women who act like this.

I've usually used anchoring as my technique for dealing with this feeling, but it seems to be failing.  There are certainly things out there that I enjoy, and I know what I want to do with my life, but I do not consider any activity or hobby I enjoy strong enough to be an anchor.  The one thing I do genuinely care about is people, and I've used those close to me as my anchor, but now I'm starting to lose that a bit.  I think it's the fact that during the week I realized that my closest friends are all either not as close as I thought or are going to graduate soon.  I'm not trying to say that I have terrible friends, in fact I find this school is full of the most amazing people and I've formed so many meaningful relationships, but my friends have SOs that trump any relationship I could hope to forge with them.  I think this is simply a fact of life, and at first was okay with this, but after not being in a relationship for years now I have come to miss the intimacy that comes with it.  I've made attempts to get closer to others in this regard, but I find it difficult to have feelings for others, and of those I do care for in this aspect either have someone already or never have and are not willing to start now.  I know my family cares for me but I find it hard to connect with them when I consider them, for the most part, terrible people.  As far as other mechanisms go I find isolation and distraction to be impossible.  I did go through a period of sublimation in high school where I would write poetry, and it helped significantly, but as of late I find no motivation or desire to do so again.  I'm very interested to hear what anchors or sublimation techniques other people in a similar situation use, or perhaps a different technique altogether."

2246,2016-04-26 02:17:55,"6038, I have also gotten rejected by this one girl who liked me but wasn't ready for a relationship due to some other jerk who broke her heart. It happens. Some people aren't ready to date someone due to certain circumstances in their lives. I assume, from the pain you are describing, that you have known this girl for a long time and have been her friend for a few years, so I understand that it can hurt when a girl you like so much and know so well says she cannot go out with you. But you shouldn't take it personally. I am SURE there are other circumstances in her life that are preventing her from going out with you even if she likes you. But I would say that it probably is better that you do not go out with someone at this time because if this situation makes you suicidal, maybe it is best not to go out with someone because relationships usually end, and trust me, that will hurt more than anything in the world."

2257,2016-04-26 02:23:20,"Regarding Active Consent:

I've seen some people commenting that constantly checking up on their partner mid-sex is unreasonable or awkward. But it really isn't. Every once in a while you ask them how they're doing: ""do you like this?"", ""are you having fun?"", ""what would you like?"", things like that. And if their response isn't as enthusiastic as you expect them to be, or if there isn't a response, or you have reason to believe they might not be having a good time, just remind them that you guys can stop at any time and that you won't mind. Nothing big, just once in a while, depending on how long it lasts.

I was brought up in a culture where girls are taught to put others' wants before their own needs, and while I don't believe this should be true for anyone else, I have a hard time not doing this myself. Sometimes during sex with my boyfriend I find myself thinking, ""oh, this hurts... but it doesn't hurt *that* much, and I want him to feel good... maybe I can endure it till he's done"", and I can't bring myself to tell him to stop even though I'm having a really bad time. Luckily, my boyfriend really cares about active consent and he asks how I'm doing, and if I'm hesitant to answer, he reminds me that it's alright to stop. This has really helped me get better at letting him know how I feel, which in the end helps sex become a good experience for both of us, physically and emotionally.

I don't know how many people will share the exact specifics of my story but I think a lot of people will resonate with it. 

I mean, you care about your partner, right? You want them to feel good. So just ask them and make sure they are, it's really not hard."

2271,2016-04-26 02:04:41,"Why does everyone think ""Campaign Finance Reform™"" is so important? Do you think every politician will magically stop begin corrupt if some law is passed saying they can't receive money from certain people in certain ways? Do you seriously believe all of those big evil corporations won't find another way besides campaign donations to buy politicians (something they already do btw)? You are never going to get money out of politics with some bs law that does absolutely nothing to address the roots of the problem. Corporations aren't still buying and controlling politicians because we just haven't yet passed a law saying they can't do that in one particular way. Money is in politics because human beings in general, and especially those who are successful politicians, are inherently corrupt. If you don't want corporations buying politicians then don't give politicians so much power and control over every aspect of society that they're worth buying in the first place."
2272,2016-04-26 02:57:50,"NOTE:This is just a thought moving through my mind for some days now and is here only for a healthy debate, I don't want to hurt anyone.

So, we are all up against on race, gender,culture and religious differences recently and are just building upon the idea of humanity, but is this possible at all? I mean to say, For solving a problem, the intelligence (or wisdom level) should be more than what was used to create the problem, so if these differences were not really human idealogical conflicts, we really dont have the power solve it, because the difference is in the very nature that created us and it is just expressing itself,
for example the more you move away from reality, the more it appears in unison, just like a person who takes penance, there are only two entities, universe and oneself, but the more you try to comprehend reality, it seems to breakdown from the ""universe"" to say ""galaxies"" to planets to countries to people to cultures to people to family to brothers to bodies to organs to cells to nuclei to atoms to electrons to quarks(there are even two of these), See its in the very nature?

So are we heading in the right direction?

As someone who is a double minority (a woman and a POC) at MIT and in the STEM fields or higher education in general I think it's a joke every time they say this. I don't think having a group where there are 120+ members and then having only 3 girls be Black and maybe 3-4 girls be Hispanic when everyone else is either white or Asian is diversity especially when we talked about recruitment outfits and you guys just assumed we should wear the same makeup or wear the same exact hair style. If you guys actually appreciated diversity you would understand what is wrong with that. I understand that we should look uniform for Recruitment but if you're going to brag about how diverse we are then why try to whitewash every girl in the chapter? That is why I think it's a joke. And this is not to say that I don't love my fellow sisters. But honestly, having one type of minority in a group does not make you diverse and it's a bit offensive to me for you guys to think that people that look like me are well-represented simply because their is one other girl of my race in a 120+ chapter when everyone knows very well that if the roles were reversed you wouldn't be singing the same tune."

I am quite honestly astonished by the sheer number of Bernie Sanders supporters at MIT and other elite institutions of higher learning across the U.S. 

While I actually agree whole-heartedly with him on social and foreign policy issues, his fiscal and economic policies are as absurdist as a 1972 Luis Buñuel movie. Not only would a 15 dollar minimum wage instituted at a federal level decrease overall social welfare but it would actually hurt the poorest people of the country the most. There would be much fewer jobs for American workers and more jobs outsourced. People that are willing to work for less aren't able to. Of course certain cities/ states can viably maintain a 15 dollar minimum wage which is why it has been instituted at those levels. Then Sanders goes on to say that he would be in support of regulation that would make it illegal for American companies to outsource jobs and would like to see an end to most of our free trade agreements with China, NAFTA, etc. This is almost comedic in stupidity. If that regulation was actually passed, companies would simply move out of the U.S which would hurt the economy even more. Tapping into the global economic ecosystem is crucial for American success in the future and it is a backwards view to isolate ourselves. Finally, at the crux of Sander's economic policy is the villainizing of the rich. It's clear through all the various debates that he views rich people as greedy, evil people that provide no value to society. This simplified and narrow-minded view is ignorant. Yes the previous recession was in part caused by ""greedy"" leaders of banks but from a higher perspective the actual problem was caused by mis-aligned incentives on the part of the federal reserve and U.S government. Additionally, the finance industry is largely responsible for the innovation and growth of the American economy throughout much of the past decade, which Sanders clearly doesn't know/ acknowledge. 

No Bernie, I refuse to ""feel the bern"", and I would highly encourage fellow MIT students to consider the consequences of these fiscal/ economic policies thoroughly before blindly hopping aboard the hype train.

2344,2016-04-24 22:53:16,"since MIT confessions has technical difficulties, I started reading other colleges' confessions"
2345,2016-04-24 22:42:17,"One of my classmates asked me how I'm so happy here and have all my work and stuff together and well-managed. Of course I gave the cliché answer of time management and studying hard and of course he nodded in approval and respect. But what I really want to say is I look so happy because I'm a fucking liar and always have been. 

I lie to everyone. My classmates, my professors, my advisers, even my own family. I lie to all of them constantly. I put on a fucking show every time I walk out of my single, a show where I'm the main character with a big fat lying smile on her face. Sure, I look happy and put together. I have my hair done every day, with matching outfits and shoes and a perfectly organized room and perfect notes and near perfect p-sets. But I spend every moment I'm not in class or recitation alone. I eat alone, work alone, sleep alone, and hang out by myself all the time. 

I like to have alone time sometimes, but that doesn't mean that I like to be lonely and lonely is all I've felt since I started school here since I've failed to really make any friends. And I’ve tried to make friends. I really have. But I feel like I get constantly ignored and pushed out of conversations as if no one wants me around. And frankly if they don’t, I don’t blame them, I don’t really like myself that much either. One of my bigs didn’t even remember my name and at the Activities Midway (or whatever it’s called) during CPW, the members of my club introduced each other to the pre-frosh but neglected to introduce me as if I wasn’t standing right next to them and then when I tried to introduce myself no one cared. 

Some nights I shove an entire bag of candy down my throat even if I'm not hungry and then I cry myself to sleep. Every time I have an exam, I spend the night before it having a panic attack and then when the exam is over I go to a bathroom where I know that no one I know will find me and have another panic attack in there, wash my face with cold water to hide the evidence of my tears, and continue my little lying show with a smile on my face. I'm crying right now as I write this confession, but I’ll just pull out the bag of ice I keep in my mini-fridge for my swollen red eyes whenever I start crying and keep on going. The sad thing is that my priority is to sob soft enough so that my suitemates don’t hear me. 

I fear that I have depression and I fear that I'll spend the rest of my life alone and in a constant state of never-ending fluctuations of anxiety and panic attacks. I understand why no one would want to be around me. When I’m not in public I’m the biggest fucking mess you would have ever seen in your life. But of course I’d never let anyone know that, not even my parents because they would just worry about me and they can’t do anything to help me because they’re just not here. And me feeling this way isn’t because of MIT, I’ve had anxiety issues and panic attacks my entire life and I honestly love MIT but all I want is to not be alone all the time. I spent all of elementary, middle, and high school with either no friends or fake friends and I really don’t want that for myself here as well.

I’m only a freshman and I don’t know how much longer I can keep up this lie. I really can’t bring myself to tell anyone how I really feel. If you ask me how I’m doing I default to my beautifully rehearsed set of phrases that convey being ok. I guess I’m just too used to people invalidating my problems and telling me how much worse other people have it or just getting ignored entirely. 

So, to that person who asked me how I’m so happy, my real answer is I am happy but miserable at the same time. I bury my emotions in my schoolwork and hope they stay buried under piles of p-sets, notes, and to-do lists, but every now and then they slip up and resurface as they are doing now while I type up this confession in tears. But frankly, I’m not even sure what it means to really feel happy anymore and I don’t think I ever felt that in my life."

    So Bernie was fun and all and totally like a grampa who tells you all those stories about back in the day walking uphill both ways to to school except with Bernie it was like an easy coast downhill both ways and that’s just not how things work right?

    So we knew Bernie wasn’t going to be the nominee you right? We knew that. Hillary was always going to be the nominee and honestly for me the whole Bernie thing was a little insulting but I get it. I get why people liked that atmosphere or whatever. Like I don’t like Phish and think they’re actually bad musicians it’s not just their songs but I totally get why kids follow them around on tour. It’s fun and it’s a complete break from reality right? Bernie was like a vacation from real stuff and I totally get that real stuff is sometimes a little onerous but honestly we aren’t fifth graders anymore and real life isn’t homework it’s just real life and real issues that we need to take care of like right now.

    So I’m actually really happy for Bernie because he was too old for this nonsense anyway right? Like I totally love the idea of Bernie heading back to Vermont in a covered wagon eating beef jerky and smoking a pipe and just kind of grumbling the whole way until he gets back to his log cabin where he tosses a few logs into the wood-burning stove and fries up some bacon and flapjacks in his trusty cast iron pan and just covers everything with that famous Grade A Amber VT Maple Syrup before taking one of his storied three hour naps right? And obviously he’s wearing real flannel not the hipster stuff and also suspenders. I get it I do. He’s like a cartoon from a kids book and who isn’t a kid at heart right but sometimes we have to be adults. Like everyone loves cartoon curmudgeon pancake Bernie and that’s actually the real Bernie which is so lovable but definitely not president material. So I get it and I hope that he hasn’t done enough damage to his reputation to lose reelection because we’re definitely definitely going to need him once Hillary wins.

    So if you have a Bernie bumper sticker on your laptop or on your door please take it off k? We really really need to stand together against Trump here because I read yesterday that he has like 53% support acrosss America or some other kind of nonsense from The Economist which is super biased and pretty much written by Karl Rove. He also won New York. So please all you Bernouts please head on over and join us at Team Hillary because even though we’re super strong already which is why we crushed Bernie in the primaries and he’s going to drop out soon we still need all the help we can get to defeat Trump who is running away with this thing and getting tons of press lately.

    So here’s probably the best way to get started and get on board:

It all just happened recently... I'm still heartbroken & it's going to take time, for me to get myself back as I was before all of this happened... Oooh! I forgot to tell you right now I'm so messy, twisty & also hurt, but besides all this I still have to keep smiling & be happy about what happened. That's the reason I want my old self back who didn't seem to care & was happy with myself. I'm back. Call me pathetic but I just tried myself to get him back. Lousy! :-( Love is really stupid. And for him (A)I used to think him with the start of the day till the end of the day. He was always on my mind. (I guess he will is) By the way I used to talk about him on messenger daily. He's still a bit flirty & when he used to flirt with me I used to be on cloud 9. I always thought of him as my lover boy though we're just friends now. But he kept on calling me his future wife. Who wouldn't be amazed with that? I was liking and falling for him more and more. 
1st of April (the day I decided to leave) at around 10:35 I blocked him. I went into shock and after an hour of crying I realised everything. I was all teary. I'll be alright, I know. I wish him everything. I'm happy for him, (??) really happy with all my heart. (well shattered heart) I want to be happy and wish success for myself. People may see me as strong but I am weak inside. ?? I want to move on but tell me how can I stop not to unblock him everytime I miss him. I don't want my family & friends thinking of what happened to me & for sure can't give any idea of what's happening with me... God only can remove me out of my misery. ?? See what it had led me to... I'm today writing my heart out, hoping it will lessen the burden on my heart & help me move on. But why did it happen? What did I do to deserve this? No one can imagine what torches I am going through each and everyday of my life.... 'smiling' when all I want to do is cry. And today, here I'm Lonely:as always. 
P.S. 
 A, 
I'M SORRY OK? I'M SORRY FOR NOT BEING A PERFECT GIRLFRIEND. SORRY FOR NOT GIVING WHAT YOU WANT. I STILL BELIEVE ON WHAT WE CALL MORALITY. AND I HATE THE IDEA OF SENDING YOU NUDE PICS. I NEVER TRIED THAT & NEVER IN MY WILDEST DREAM TO DO THAT. CIAO!

But really I just think he’s ignoring me and watching Netflix with his partner or something. What’s sad is he’s the only person I talk to here. I’m painfully shy, awkward, and unsocial, and he’s the only person I’ve gotten completely comfortable with in my time here.

2402,2016-04-24 21:02:14,"This issue has been on my mind for a long time and after watching the last democratic debate, I realized I had to make this post. I am quite honestly astonished by the sheer number of Bernie Sanders supporters at MIT and other elite institutions of higher learning across the U.S. 

While I actually agree whole-heartedly with him on social and foreign policy issues, his fiscal and economic policies are as absurdist as a 1972 Luis Buñuel movie. Not only would a 15 dollar minimum wage instituted at a federal level decrease overall social welfare but it would actually hurt the poorest people of the country the most. There would be much fewer jobs for American workers and more jobs outsourced. People that are willing to work for less aren't able to. Of course certain cities/ states can viably maintain a 15 dollar minimum wage which is why it has been instituted at those levels. Then Sanders goes on to say that he would be in support of regulation that would make it illegal for American companies to outsource jobs and would like to see an end to most of our free trade agreements with China, NAFTA, etc. This is almost comedic in stupidity. If that regulation was actually passed, companies would simply move out of the U.S which would hurt the economy even more. Tapping into the global economic ecosystem is crucial for American success in the future and it is a backwards view to isolate ourselves. Finally, at the crux of Sander's economic policy is the villainizing of the rich. It's clear through all the various debates that he views rich people as greedy, evil people that provide no value to society. This simplified and narrow-minded view is ignorant. Yes the previous recession was in part caused by ""greedy"" leaders of banks but from a higher perspective the actual problem was caused by mis-aligned incentives on the part of the federal reserve and U.S government. Additionally, the finance industry is largely responsible for the innovation and growth of the American economy throughout much of the past decade, which Sanders clearly doesn't know/ acknowledge. 

No Bernie, I refuse to ""feel the bern"", and I would highly encourage fellow MIT students to consider the consequences of these fiscal/ economic policies thoroughly before blindly hopping aboard the hype train.

Like there was someone out there to listen to me and care.

Yet, like many of the friends I've cared about in the past, she walked out of my life just as soon as she had meant the world to me. Now the moments and laughs we shared are nothing more than distant memories and I to her am just slightly better than a stranger.

Now there are moments between psets, between the firehose of activities at MIT wherein I catch myself crying. Those are the moments when I question why things happened the way they did that I finally remember: I'm just a loser, a geek, a stupid kid with big dreams."

2414,2016-04-24 21:55:28,"This question may sound bad but please hear me out, I mean this in the least judgmental way possible: Why do Asians feel like they're underrepresented here? Asian Americans represent about 5% of the US population but at MIT represent about 30% of the student population. Meanwhile US population vs MIT population for other races respectively is about 12% to 10%(even though many black students will say that is number is more realistically 5-6%) for Black students, 16% to 14% for Hispanic/Latino students, and 63% to 51% for White/Caucasian students. (I'm not including the numbers for international students, undocumented people, or other smaller or foreign groups because the numbers on specific groups are a bit fuzzy.) But according to these numbers, how do you feel underrepresented? Again, this is out of pure curiosity. I do not mean this in any judgmental or possibly racist way. I just overheard a few Asian pre-frosh talking about discrimination in admissions processes and feeling underrepresented at a school like MIT and I just want to understand your perspective better."

I get the monetary aspect of needing to ‘fill the house’ but monetary concerns like that should never come ahead of the well-being of the members (can’t we find some other money source??). Luckily I’m probably not going to be forced to move into the house, so I guess this doesn’t directly affect me, but if I was forced I would probably have to make the tough decision to de-affiliate because I don’t want to leave my current living situation and clearly the organization isn’t putting my happiness first.

Surely I can't be the only one...I probably would be able to do so much more but I have this really bad habit that I haven't been able to kick. I've never told a soul about this but here goes.

It all started last summer. I was bored in my room, just watching some Netflix when my I noticed my alarm clock on my counter, and for some reason, I saw it in a different light. It looked...appealing. No, that's not it...it looked appetizing. Yeah, it made me hungry, somehow. I still don't know why this happened, but I impulsively grabbed it off the desk, brought it to my mouth, and took a bite. The metallic parts crunched underneath my teeth. It was incredible. The crunch, the little sometimes-still-moving-parts...I sat on that bed for hours on end, just eating that goddamned clock, piece by piece, hour after hour.

Fast forward to today. I have consumed countless clocks. I order tasty looking ones off of Amazon, and unbeknownst to my friends, I eat them. Slowly, and as silently as I can manage. I know this isn't normal. I just don't know what to do anymore guys. I don't know what my life is. This is what I do instead of working. I spend hours just eating clocks, day after day. And by the time I'm done eating the clocks, the day is basically over. No time for psets.

Eating clocks is just so damn time consuming."

I'm writing this because I cannot understand one thing. You are the most intelligent people in the world and still I have a feeling like our generation, at the MIT either, is a generation of regress.

And I think that is an incredible aspect of our school.

The difference is that no one thinks getting killed is trivial. Also it happens to everyone, it's life's great equalizer. 

People make getting raped seem trivial all the time. ""So what, like you had sex, and regretted it?"" That really hurts.

That's why it's not okay to use getting raped as a joke.

In a similar fashion, it would be okay to say, ""oh man, that test killed me,"" but it would not be okay to say, ""oh man, that test gassed me in Auschwitz"" or ""oh man, that test lynched me like they do down south"" or ""oh man, that test hit me like a Muslim jihadist hitting the World Trade Center.""

A high school teacher once went so far as to ask who would be stupid enough to die in the manner my parents died, having no knowledge of the situation. I was the only one who even noticed this, of course, because people just don't care about things that don't affect themselves. So many people make so many judgments about other people, without taking a moment to realize that there are real people affected by what you say and how you treat people. And yeah, I get that my personal issues aren't really up there on the level of importance as Black Lives Matter and the LGBTQ movement, but you know what?

Secondly, I find it hard to keep a conversation going most of the times. It feels like people doesn't care what I'm passionate about/I don't care what the people I'm meeting are passionate about. This might also be a big reason why I de so antisocial, but how can I break out of this circle? 
Finally, due to spending most of my high school life after some very special extracurricular activity, I am mote used to being in a clique than being in a friend circle that's more of a sparse graph.

2508,2016-04-16 01:38:35,"Was in Baker D and overhead a group of black women talking about Trevor McMichael's post, and how insensitive and offensive he what he said in the caption. About 5 minutes later after getting my food, I hear them from across the dining hall calling each other retarded and laughing hysterically.

This stood out as amazingly ironic to me, and I now realize I've seen it in many other instances than this.

I understand that people would find his post offensive, especially if it spoke about something you could relate to. But seriously, you're going to act like everything you say is PC and that you are so careful about every word you speak? Sure, his post was on facebook (public) which opens him up to much more criticism, but don't pretend that you've never said anything analogously offensive, or that if you did that you always self-reflected and caught yourself. 

There is so much judgement, ignorance, and hate in this world and I understand that you want to rid our community of all of it. But who do you think you are to be excused from your own social contract when someone else breaks it? Especially when you don't always hold yourself to it either. Hate doesn't justify hate. 

How about we think a little bit more about all the things that WE DO to those we impact, and a little less about what we think society is doing to us. How about we use these instances of lack of knowledge to EDUCATE, rather than take out all the anger, the anger that has bottled up from the injustices in our lives, on one another.

So many people are so quick to be skeptical of Trevor's intentions and sincerity in apology. First of all, think of something you've said or done that could be insensitive towards a group or persons and imagine having probably 100s of people talking to you about it and shaming you for it. Think about how you would respond. Think about how that would feel. Think about how difficult it is to say the perfect apology when it's so easy for anyone to say ""well that's just not good enough"". Why do you want to inflict these feelings on to someone so badly?

Let's have a bit more empathy. A bit more understanding. Give what you want to receive. More talking, less accusing. More learning, less labeling. For fucks sake, stop letting every word that is said affect your emotional well-being; life is hard enough already. It should be addressed, but why emotionally attach to a principle that can only bring you down, especially when the whole motive is to get rid of that principle? You can make change from a more unattached and empathetic role.

Anyway, I love you all. I felt like this is something that should be said a little bit more, and even if people disagree I think that this is the direction we all truly want to go in in our conversations (love, empathy, and understanding that is).

Honestly, everyone is overreacting; don't use this to further your ""Black lives matter"" agenda and throw him under the bus. How dare you say that Trevor and the council ""don't belong at MIT"" just because of something he said that happened to strike a nerve. Take a moment to think about what you're saying before you also say something that you regret. What you are saying is just going to isolate people from each other and create tension; you're not getting anywhere by starting a Facebook shitstorm. If it really bothers everyone so much, go talk to him in person and tell him how you feel, don't hide behind a fucking Facebook wall. Also, he apologized so stop posting your ""opinions"" everywhere, no one wants to hear them."

However, I think that what many of you are doing is not confronting that ignorance as a whole - you are attacking one kid, one of so many people that are ignorant to the plight the underprivileged in this country. What you are doing is cyber-bullying, and to put Trevor's “life on blast” is wrong. Trying to humiliate someone in front of the entire school is the kind of behavior that makes people kill themselves, and it is totally unacceptable.

The disgraceful ""#endofacareer"" hashtag shows your true intentions and idk what you personally have against Trevor, but since you're too much of a coward to put your friggin name on the post you prevent anyone from realizing what this is really about. Trevor at worst made one mistake and apologized profusely, while staying calm during bullying (read: ""#endofacareer"" & ""are you going to post this to your wall"" (Tremaan Robbins, not OP) literally seconds after he initially posted it, before he could've even navigated to post it on his wall) and attacks at his personal character that had to have been absolutely tough for him. Along those lines, wtf Deven Lahoti, posting the pic does what exactly besides prevent us from moving past this and potentially triggering more people? That's the definition of incitement. Also, before anyone calls me a hypocrite for posting this anonymously I want to clarify I have no intention of getting into the fucked up world of politics and minor offenses, and also I am defending a clearly maliciously toned post, not going out of my way to attack facelessly. A final thought: We're all MIT students and this place really friggin sucks as is, so we can't hate and turn on each other. If someone messes up, call them out and make sure they don't do it again, but don't attack them, cause then you're unequivocally as bad or even worse (in this case since the instigator was a minor offhanded offense and the reply was a direct malicious attack, I'm going to classify it as worse) than the original issue."

2555,2016-04-16 01:44:17,"To the previous post about social awkwardness at MIT, I'm sorry you think we're such dorks to you. I for one was raised in a cold, overbearing household. I didn't make friends because my parents didn't trust my classmates. I was just weird and alone all the time, but I had good grades. That's all I knew until college. Thank goodness I have some friends here, but there are many people (especially girls) who judge me for not the well-connected, charismatic social butterfly of their dreams. Don't ask people to imply they should be someone else when you ask them to just bee themselves."
2556,2016-04-16 01:37:19,"What is offensive about the ""inner city kids"" post? Like I understand not thinking it's funny. I even understand seeing it and thinking ""that might be a little inappropriate"". But the idea that an adult could be so disturbed by viewing a joke someone posted on social media that they feel compelled to angrily call the person out in a public forum is baffling to me. He needs to be ""held accountable"" for posting a completely benign joke on facebook? Are you even real people? 

And then when the dude is nice enough to apologize for something he should in no way have to apologize for at all, you whiny dicks have the balls to complain that his apology wasn't posted publicly enough, or didn't demonstrate enough remorse? You write a whole comment saying you don't think he understands why his post was ""offensive"" and how you won't forgive him until he demonstrates that he understands why his post was so ""problematic"", but you don't even give a single reason explaining why you found it offensive in the first place. You look forward to seeing him educate himself? Well if you're such an enlightened being, why don't you help ""educate"" him?

The only ignorance he displayed in making that post was ignorance to how many bitchy little weirdos are evidently enrolled at MIT.

I don't know why I'm even bothering to make this post. It's certainly not going to get anyone to look at things any differently than they already do. It's not going to accomplish anything, other than giving you guys something else to take offense to. There will probably be a few comments explaining how stupid and ""problematic"" my attitude is. But whatever. I really just needed to let you people who were brave and heroic and enlightened enough to be offended by a joke what enormous pricks you are."

2623,2016-04-15 01:35:27,"What do I do if I am actually too dumb to take 'real' courses here at MIT. My high school didn't have nearly enough math or science classes and I never really learned the fundamentals of mathematics. Literally the other day during a test I had to see if it was possible to split a square root. I got a B- in 18.02, and can apply 'higher' level concepts (as if 18.02 were high level concepts) to problems but lack the strong foundation. It takes me so much longer to remember how basic things work just to understand the intricacy of mathematical concepts. This disadvantage carries over into other coursework, because while I understand the concepts behind how to solve certain problems, I execute the solutions very poorly. 

This combined with the rigor of classes here and the fact that everyone, even the 'dumb' people perform much better than me in easy classes has made me lose my passion for learning. I go to bed with a feeling of dread about how much work I have to do to progress just slightly, and have come to accept that I won't understand material even if I go to office hours and pour my heart out into it. I don't even know what interests me anymore. I lack the drive and passion that I once had for learning in high school and constantly think about how my life would be had I attended a different school. I can't transfer out because my GPA is such shit.

I feel like I really don't belong at this school and I'm not smart enough to take any sort of class and do well. Am I relegated to just majoring in Business Management at the premiere engineering school in the nation and hope to god that I can find a job that pays at least 50,000 dollars?

I'm sorry if my post could have been confused for something someone else would think that you wrote, but unfortunately that is one of the downsides of anonymous confessions that people who follow MIT Confessions must face.  At the same time, the fact that no one can prove that you wrote something is one of the advantages of anonymous confessions, so if someone does want to accuse you of making a post (which is a bold strategy) you could always just deny it.  And yes, I am well aware that MIT Confessions is not the optimal medium for solving my problems, but that was not my intention.  5612 was actually an attempt to clarify that the points in 5428 (an earlier post of mine) about being treated like shit and hating this person were not my genuine feelings and rather a melodramatic rage by me (I still stand by the other points however).  I would love to confront my problems, and have made attempts to do so, but it is difficult when this person refuses to acknowledge my existence.  Furthermore, the fact that you are worried about someone confusing you as the OP of 5612 suggests to me that you may actually feel this way about someone or could benefit from clarifying your feelings with someone.  I truly wish you the best of luck and hope that you find yourself in a better position than I."

I met another girl who also has a boyfriend who she loves very much and has been with for a long time. I find her very attractive and she finds me attractive too. We’ve become good friends and I notice we act different when we’re with each other. It’s kind of refreshing. We both wish we could’ve met each other before our respective significant others. And we’re not willing to let go of our significant others because there lies uncertainty between us that has been resolved in our current respective relationships. That, and there’s a bit of a sunk cost too. We’re both kinda keeping in touch with each other in case things don’t work out with our respective partners, kinda like networking, but for relationships. We’re both each other’s love backups I guess, but we don’t dare act on impulses because that would be disloyal to our respective partners or even explicitly mention that we’re each others backups.

Is that weird? The whole love-backup, love-networking, sunk-cost, no-acting-on-impulse thing?"

2662,2016-04-13 16:34:50,"@5676 Yes, the security policies are terrible. But as far as I can tell, the reason getting 40 people to sacrifice their time wouldn't be because anyone likes the security policies, or even that not enough people care. It's that trying to fight it WOULDN'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE.

The deans have admitted that the policy is blatantly just about liability, and not a result of any actual concern for students. Which is terrible, but MIT is a cooperation, and at least they're being honest about it. So they keep forcing their RLADs to send nasty emails that give students anxiety, ""Shit, I forgot to yell at my friend for not tapping her ID! Am I going to get kicked out? Agh!"" And they're going to keep ignoring giant student polls showing that everyone hates the security and that people don't actually feel more secure. And they're going to keep their dumb security policy that ensures that students have to constantly police and mistrust their friends, or risk getting kicked off of campus.

Because guess what? MIT can't get sued now, and that's really important here."

2667,2016-04-13 16:47:57,"""I would never tell anyone who feels victimized that they should keep quiet, never have, and never will."" ""calling someone a criminal when they have not been found guilty of committing a crime cannot occur"" Aren't those two statements in conflict? How can you support rape victims and say that they should share their stories, but at the same time say that they can't ever name their rapists unless they've been found guilty? We all know that courts are stacked against them, and something like 2% of rapists ever get convicted. By saying that the other 98% of victims cannot name their rapists, you're effectively silencing them and constraining what you think is acceptable for them to say. This is not support. You're putting up more barriers and making it harder for them to come forward. I get the problems here with someone spreading an accusation across 20 people and with anonymity, but saying that no one can share their story unless they've won a criminal trial agrees wrongly equates truth with the justice system. We shouldn't be pushing rape victims to report if they don't think it's best for them, and we shouldn't tell them they can only share their stories if they've won a trial. The self-guilt is strong, and this makes it worse. I worry that my friends who've been considering sharing their stories won't after this, because they know there's no criminal evidence and they'll never win a trial and it's scary to see this from a GRT (who we turn to for support). I'm sad that they might imagine trying to share this with their floor and having the response be that they can't share it because they haven't gone through the criminal trial. I'm hope this isn't what's happening, but it seems likely ):"

It felt like you accused me of hurting you in the same way I had been, despite the grossly different roles we each played. Your false affections and your admitting you used me for sex also strongly hurt me, considering the aftermath of the assault. This whole thing might be why I ""won't listen to your feelings.""

2681,2016-04-13 16:52:25,"I have a question for transgender or gender fluid (generally not cis) people.

I am a cis male, and am happy identifying as such. However, I've never felt a strong sense of resonance or identity with my gender; it's just sort of a fact about me, along with my height or eye color. While my gender affects my interactions with the world around me, I do not feel like it in a vacuum changes who I am or how I view myself. Thus, I identify as male out of convenience.

It seems to me that to be transgender or gender fluid, one must have a much stronger sense of gender identity than I do. My question then is where does this gender identity stem from? Do you feel there is some innate, primal difference between the male and female psyche, and you don't identify with that assigned to you? Or does it have more to do with identifying more strongly with the societal image of men vs women? Would the latter still apply if we ever reached a point where we got rid of gender as a societal construct?"

They will never understand the pain of hearing survivor after survivor recall when they were raped. And yet I see this rude display in the student center as if none of the struggles of women matter anymore. What is the point of this shit? To push an agenda?

My understanding is that affirmative action was made because POC's are statistically more likely to come from lesser-privileged homes and therefore should be given a slight advantage when it comes to university applications. So to eliminate all the backlash from A.A. why can't they just not look at race and scale acceptances with income? That way they give equal weight to all races and all income levels.

2782,2016-04-12 23:01:50,"1. And as God once spun the whole world out of himself, so too the time will come for the world to coalesce and fuse in such a way as to recreate God. From which follows...

2. God's secret. Contrary to popular belief, he doesn't like to be ""outside"" the universe. He prefers to be inside it, where, as he himself has put it, ""all the fun shit happens"". For the eternal enemy of God is not, and has never been the Devil (for in fact the two of them are one and the same being), but good old plain boredom.

3. From the Declaration of Independence of a future Human nation: ""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all lifeforms are created unequal, that they have no rights whatsoever apart from those that the ruling caste deems expedient to endow them with at any given time, and that Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness are not ideals to be placed over free men but mirages with which to confuse the weak minds of slaves and lead them to their holding cells"".

4. The so-called ""real"" is merely someone else's fantasy.

5. The anti-racists say: there are no races. There are no lions, tigers, cougars, jaguars, panthers: they are all just cats. There are no blacks and whites — we are all just people. There are no people and animals — we are all just lifeforms. There are no beings and things — we are all just parts of the flux. Which strictly speaking is true, but which, by depriving us of any possible words and concepts, in no way helps us analyze anything or even so much as communicate — by which fact the will of those who reason in this way stands revealed.

6. ""ALL CULTURES ARE EQUAL. WE SHOULD LOVE AND CHERISH ALL OF THEM EQUALLY."" O rly? And what about the cultures that practice human sacrifice? Are those equal too? Or how about Viking culture, or samurai culture, or Taliban culture, etc. etc. etc. But what the subhuman means by ""culture"" is merely some funny costumes and exotic dishes (which, by the way, are not equal either). That's how far his understanding of the concept of culture goes. And so it is with everything. So while hypocritically professing the equality of all cultures, he is hard at work in their destruction, and in the universalization and domination of his own: subhuman culture.

7. In short, all cultures are equal, but some are more equal than others. The subhumans are the pigs in Orwell's parable, and even Orwell himself was one of them: an eloquent and crafty little pig.

8. Napoleon's tomb at Les Invalides. The feeling of weight here would crush even an Atlas. This is no mere ""man's"" tomb, is what the architect is saying to you: a superhuman being must lie here. And now compare him with the celebrity nobodies if you want to understand the meaning of the word ""nausea"".

9. ""Life's too short"" means: ""my power's too small"".

10. The microscientists claim that there ""are"" 4, or 6, or 27 dimensions, dispute each other's claims and try to ""find"" exactly how many dimensions there ""are"". But a dimension is not something that exists outside the brain, but a mere concept that the brain creates and projects onto its environment in order to ""understand"" it (i.e., as I'll be explaining shortly, predict its behavior with a view to shaping it for its wishes). The microscientists have once more mistaken their models for reality, and have confused the question of the number of dimensions of the universe (infinite — which is to say the same thing as one), with the number of dimensions in their models (the more the better). The more dimensions a brain can resolve, the more subtle, more powerful it is. Which is why the microscientists say that there ""are"" 4, or 6, or 27 of them — and I say infinite.

11. If you say, ""it is not fair that his parents are rich and mine poor"", you might as well say, ""it is not fair that he is tall and I am short"". And why stop there? It is not fair that the earth turns around the sun, the sun should turn around the earth — at which point the sheer absurdity and wretchedness of the whole business becomes obvious.

12. How does resentment feel? It feels like unfairness, injustice. It directs the gaze outward, to protect one from dwelling on the flagrant lack of power which led one to feel resentment in the first place. It is not the Other that is causing the resentment, but yourself, and all resentment does is protect you from this painful realization, which would be otherwise added to the already unbearable pain of the resentment's cause.

13. The kingdom of God is inside you, said the Nazarene. But the subhumans are still looking for it, not merely outside themselves, but even ""outside"" the universe. You can lead a mule to water...

14. I have nothing but love for my teachers. To be resentful of and hate your teacher is the first symptom of the bad, the hopeless student. And to envy him of the mediocre.

15. The shallow thinkers — who want moreover to pass to you for ""humanitarians"" — say: ""Don't investigate the people, investigate the system"". But the people are the system. Who do you think created the system? The magical system fairies? Investigating the system ends up leading you back to the people; more precisely, to the psychological processes which led them to create it.

16. The confidence fagotry. ""Just be confident"", etc. The most they can do is bluff, but a man who's bluffing will react very differently from someone who's the real deal when pushed — and then all your stupid blanket advice will manage to accomplish is to get some poor little weakling's face smashed in.

17. Understanding goes from higher to lower, there's no understanding from lower to higher, only misunderstanding — some absurd simplification/falsification/reinterpretation of the signs. I am not talking to you, you just happen to be within hearing distance while I address the ones I am talking to. Moreover, there's no question of you disagreeing — or even of agreeing with me, since you can't even parse what I am saying. We are neither agreeing nor disagreeing; we are not even communicating. You are just flapping your lips; I am the only one here who's talking; and as I've just explained, and you've failed to understand, not to you."
2783,2016-04-12 23:37:51,"Wtf #5611, I get the joke you're trying to maybe go for, but just as nobody should be shamed for choosing not to have kids, you shouldn't shame ppl for having more than one kid, aka I want 3-4.

2787,2016-04-12 23:55:57,"I'm not a MIT student. I maybe will never be one of yours. But I've started to follow MIT Confession because I wanted to see what happens there. I have one things to tell you. Your confessions are definitely not as fun as ours. I think you take everything too seriously. I mean you're in the best college of the world, you have many opportunities that I would never have. And you are still complaining. I can understand that MIT is challenging, but you have so many resources that have been created to help you. I'm in last year of bachelor, in 4 weeks, finals will begin. I still have 9 projects to do (it means at least 30h for each), some have their deadline on the same day, some need the feedback of the previous one to be done, feedback that you get 2-3 days before the deadline, but I also have labs, tests, presentation to do. And when you can ask to have more time to do your work, we cannot. When you have TA, teachers, MIT Health, etc to help you, we are alone, no one will help you. And at the end of the year, after 5 weeks of finals, after stopping my life during so many weeks trying to earn enough points during the year to secure decent grades during finals, I will only get D, C sometimes a B. It's how it works in my country. A C is great, it seriously means that you have achieve what you were request to achieve and even more. But with a C, you go nowhere. I'm in one of the best department for computer science in my country but I am also the only one that still has a chance to get her degree at the end of June. So guys, be aware of the chance you have. Take the most you can out of MIT. And when you want to complain about it, remember that many students all around the world don't have the chance to have half of your help, half of your opportunities. And please, enjoy your life as a student, it will happen only one time in your life."

It's also devastating that there's no way for us to vent this anger. You can't cancel meal plan if you live in many dorms, and that's likely the only way we could do any damage to have our voice heard. I would organize some sort of protest but I don't think we could even get 40 students to sacrifice some of their time to fight it."

2814,2016-04-12 23:19:52,"One thing has been bugging me about the Bernie Sanders movement. I've heard a lot of people here claim to support it. But, I'm not sure everyone completely understands the full implications of it. We live in an individualistic society right now. Sanders wants us to become a communal society. So far he has talked frequently about the communal benefits, government paid healthcare, government paid college, large old age benefits, etc, etc. However, he has not really talked much about that the fact that in order to get these benefits we will need to make communal sacrifice. The model he champions is the Scandinavian system. In this system the average individual pays 70 - 100% more in taxes then the average American. Yes, taxes on the rich will go up, but we don't have enough rich people with enough money to get the trillions we will need to fund all of this. The middle class and poor will have to pick up some slack from it too. The other issue is children. When we pay social security and medicare taxes, we don't pay for ourselves, we pay for current retirees, and future workers pay for us. In order to ensure that we have enough workers in the next generation to pay for these benefits we will have to push every woman to have at least two children, ideally three to be safe. Two is the minimum needed to ensure population stability. And no immigration is not a stable source of population growth. For example, Mexico has completely reversed and now more Mexicans go back, then come here. My point is, if you aren't willing to pay double in taxes and raise at least two children, then please stop claiming you are with Bernie Sanders, because you don't want to make the sacrifices necessary for what he wants."

2834,2016-04-11 02:16:28,"It's been about four months now since my boyfriend of 4 years broke up with me. He ended it out of nowhere and stopped contacting me completely. I was alright at first, but here I am nearly a semester later still randomly bursting into tears over him sometimes.

All of my friends say I should be angry with him for being so heartless, but I really just feel so guilty. We were so young when we met, and dealt with so many growing pains... there's nothing I can do at this point, but every time I get sad I have to resist the urge to call him and tell him I'm sorry-- to let him know I never knew I was so terrible to him that he'd be able to leave me so easily. To say that I wish I'd been better, tried harder, been so much more encouraging to him than I was. To let him know he's the only person I've ever said ""I love you"" to because I've never been able to imagine loving anyone else.

I miss him. So. Goddamn. Much."

I've been rejected every time I have tried to get to know someone romantically at this school so far.  Neither claimed to be interested in any sort of romantic pursuit, and whether or not they were being genuine I do think there are people that are not looking for anything and it would be helpful to distinguish so that I can avoid just chasing pavements when they lead nowhere"

I stay in my room for days at a time without eating or talking to anyone because I don’t have the energy to get out of bed. I don’t care about anything anymore and haven’t been happy in over a year.” Talking about it only seems to make me focus on it more and make me more miserable, and what’s anyone supposed to say to help anyway? It’s not like any events in my life are making me depressed. I have a great family, great friends, and am at a school I used to love so much. Nothing’s changed except me.

And it really messed up a lot of things for me until I sought outside help. I don't want to bash on anybody, but I really feel like it this type of issue is ignored and downplayed so much. I just hope some changes happen soon in which the people here become become more open to discussing that things like this exist because I love the dorm so much and the people here are so great but I would hate to know that somebody else may have to go through the same thing I did without having any sort of comfortable source of help here."

I also think that people our age tend to be very self involved and that over time people will mature and will be more supportive friends. And sometimes I tell myself these things, but I can't believe them. At those moments I choose to live because I am too angry at the people who have hurt me to let them extinguish my existence.

As a student, I've watched cruft hit on frosh and get them into a relationship that ultimately wasn't good for them (GFD follow the campsite rule). Even predatory ones who seem to do it over and over again. I've had to talk down a suicidal cruft who was living on my hall. I hope he got the help he needed, but two years graduated, he really needed better forms of help than hosed students, and hosed students are already stressed as fuck. Some clubs are monopolized by cruft in really creepy powerplays. I don't have a good solution to this. For living groups, it might be useful to talk to your GRT, RA, or house master.

Cruft, we need to be helpful or STFU. Show up to alumni events, visit friends, what ever, but also grow up, get some hobbies outside of MIT, and jesus christ stop fucking frosh. There's a whole fucking city out there. Your life can include MIT, but it shouldn't be to the point where it makes student life worse. Or yours, for that matter."

Like you had a nice upbringing where your parents emphasized education and probably put you on a track to acquire high school research experience, so you were probably a good candidate anyway, and clever enough to be at MIT.

But not everyone who is clever enough to prosper at MIT gets in. There are always more qualified applicants than those that get in. And there is that element of chance for the rest of us. But you, if you're qualified enough to do well here (or even close), you get in. I guess life is not entirely fair, and keeping faculty happy is important.

But I admit, I'm bitter sometimes. Triplets getting into MIT is great (and you are all fantastic individuals who deserve to be here) but when you are also professor's children, it's not surprising. For everyone else it's a function of luck and hard work. For you it was just hard work, and that too after being told what the next steps were, after automatically being enrolled in fancy private high schools and research programs. 

For someone who had no guidance, I guess I'm being petty and jealous. But I hate that going into the future, you'll still have cushy connections to get into grad school, and I have to once again deal with chance."

2929,2016-04-09 20:14:38,"Really getting sick of my conservative friends here playing victim and whining about how people say they shouldn't dress up in certain costumes on halloween because of ""cultural appropriation"". The key to fighting jerks who try to use that tumblr nonsense as a weapon is call them out on what they are implying. When they should you are being insensitive to minorities ask them why minorities need special treatment. They usually respond with something along the lines of historical and modern oppression. Then call them out on what they really mean. Say in a baby voice, ""Those poor little victims! They can't make it in society on their own! They need good white folks like us to help them!"" That's what these sjw really mean, they subconsciously look down on minorities as their inferiors and think that they should be the white saviors. In short they are paternal racists, they look at inferiority as a good, not bad thing. Say it to their faces. They will either not know how to respond, or get angry, completely lose it and scream incoherently at you, make a scene, and make themselves look bad. When they do, roll you eyes, smile at them condescendingly, wish them well, and walk off. This happens because most of them are very emotional people with poor self control."

It all just happened recently... I'm still heartbroken & it's going to take time, for me to get myself back as I was before all of this happened... Oooh! I forgot to tell you right now I'm so messy, twisty & also hurt, but besides all this I still have to keep smiling & be happy about what happened. That's the reason I want my old self back who didn't seem to care & was happy with myself. I'm back. Call me pathetic but I just tried myself to get him back. Lousy! :-( Love is really stupid. And for him (A)I used to think him with the start of the day till the end of the day. He was always on my mind. (I guess he will is) By the way I used to talk about him on messenger daily. He's still a bit flirty & when he used to flirt with me I used to be on cloud 9. I always thought of him as my lover boy though we're just friends now. But he kept on calling me his future wife. Who wouldn't be amazed with that? I was liking and falling for him more and more. 
1st of April (the day I decided to leave) at around 10:35 I blocked him. I went into shock and after an hour of crying I realised everything. I was all teary. I'll be alright, I know. I wish him everything. I'm happy for him, (??) really happy with all my heart. (well shattered heart) I want to be happy and wish success for myself. People may see me as strong but I am weak inside. ?? I want to move on but tell me how can I stop not to unblock him everytime I miss him. I don't want my family & friends thinking of what happened to me & for sure can't give any idea of what's happening with me... God only can remove me out of my misery. ?? See what it had led me to... I'm today writing my heart out, hoping it will lessen the burden on my heart & help me move on. But why did it happen? What did I do to deserve this? No one can imagine what torches I am going through each and everyday of my life.... 'smiling' when all I want to do is cry. And today, here I'm Lonely:as always. 
P.S. 
 A, 
I'M SORRY OK? I'M SORRY FOR NOT BEING A PERFECT GIRLFRIEND. SORRY FOR NOT GIVING WHAT YOU WANT. I STILL BELIEVE ON WHAT WE CALL MORALITY. AND I HATE THE IDEA OF SENDING YOU NUDE PICS. I NEVER TRIED THAT & NEVER IN MY WILDEST DREAM TO DO THAT. CIAO!

CPW would not even be possible without the students and I know a lot of people wouldn't have even come here if it weren't for CPW. 

Really MIT, you care so much about the pre-frosh but then don't give a shit about us when we are actually students. I don't give me that ""we care"" bullshit, especially when you spend more money putting up fucking tents and then replacing the grass on Kresge lawn that was ruined by said tents than you do on keeping student facilities up to date (flood in New House, mice in dorms, drain roaches in McCormick, need I go on?). In a sense, you are abusing free labor.

MIT would probably not even have students (or at least not enough students to keep MIT going) if it weren't for CPW because I know that for a lot of people CPW was either their only chance to visit MIT or the deciding factor on whether or not to enroll here. 

I say that the students of MIT should petition for a break over CPW weekend and threaten to boycott it. Let's see how CPW goes without us.

Well, I'll tell you why. I'm an antisocial person struggling with depression. 

When you walked in on me surronded by a mountain of tissues, I was glad you didn't say anything. But at the same time, your silence hurt. The way you turned away and carried on with your life just reminded me of how utterly alone I was.

 In my relationship with my girlfriend, if I were to pressure her for sex, it would be called rape...  whic I'm reminded of by every sex ed message/youtube/PSA out there. I often want sex more often than she does, which leaves her in the position of power attaining sex whenever she wants it.

However, there have been a few occasions in which I did not want sex when she did, and when I told her no, the tears flowed or she got angry, and would continue to pressure me, as if deep down I really did want to have sex, and if she applied the right amount of pressure I'd realize it. 

I find it unfair to be a guy, where the rape rules seem to be one-sided. Women (in a healthy relationship), get all the sex they want, have their boundaries respected, and have no social repercussions for pressuring a yes."

2975,2016-04-09 20:11:17,"I’m standing on a ledge.

People say, don’t jump. People say, think of your family. Your friends. How they will cry. The police knock on your parents’ door, and the hysterical tears that will follow. The weeks and months of therapy and grief counseling. How they will pick up the phone to call me, only to realize I’m gone. How, when I’m gone, they will miss me. 

But I don’t get it. I’m gone now. I am on this ledge. No one is missing me. 

I told myself it was in my head. I told myself that they do care. But I stayed in my room for a week, and no one cared. I ate a bag of chips and a bag of almonds and drank water from my water bottle. I didn’t talk to anyone, I didn’t go to any class, I didn’t send any emails. I turned off my phone. 

No one sent me an email. No one sent me any messages. No one knocked on my door. No one, when I finally reappeared, asked where I was. 

People say, don’t jump. People say, they will miss you. Think of your friends. Think of what you have to live for. Think of your dreams that you still have. Think of the years you will be missing. 

What about my friends? The friends that don’t call. The friends that have seen the cuts on my arms and the bruises on my legs and who have seen me vomit up the pills and the alcohol, and who still don’t call. The friends that pulled me from the bed of a stranger the day after I was raped and who apologized because in their own drunken stupors, they had not guarded my drink. The friends that didn’t notice when I was dragged out of the party by a person I didn’t know. The friends that I desperately try to reach, but who are always busy. 

I get it. MIT is busy. And they tell themselves that this one time, they won’t pick up the phone and they won’t answer the message. This one time. But the problem with “this one time” is that this time I’m on the ledge looking down and there won’t be a next time. 

What dreams am I giving up? The dreams I will never see because I can’t get out of bed. The dreams that I will never reach because of the trauma and the depression and the diagnoses. Because the medication says I’m crazy, and no one wants to hire crazy. Because my parents say I’m wrong, because girls are always asking for it. Because I have therapists and medication and they say I’m getting better.

But I’m falling into a black hole, a gravitational singularity that has caught me and will not let go. To the observer, my fall will take forever. For me, only moments. 

I’m sitting on the ledge. I’ve clicked through all my contacts. Sent texts. Came up with the courage to call. Asking someone, anyone, to reply. I know you saw it. The blessing and the curse of read receipts. But it’s 2 AM and you are putting it off. Just this one time."
2976,2016-04-09 20:38:19,"Keeping a cool head and high grades during dry spells is important. The secret is to only allow yourself to masturbate when you get an A on your midterms. This practice: 1) prevents sexual frustration 2) keeps your grades up (5.0 GPA for me), 3) temporally distributes your sessions to prevent chronic fapping, 4) spikes your test levels every week, thereby increasing your weekend gains. This is all confirmed by science and psychology. Voluntary celibacy is the truest form of discipline.

You are a canker, an open wound. I would rather kiss a lawyer than be seen with you. You took your last vacation in the Islets of Langerhans.

You're a putrescent mass, a walking vomit. You are a spineless little worm deserving nothing but the profoundest contempt. You are a jerk, a cad, and a weasel. I take that back; you are a festering pustule on a weasel's rump. Your life is a monument to stupidity. You are a stench, a revulsion, a big suck on a sour lemon.

I will never get over the embarrassment of belonging to the same species as you. You are a monster, an ogre, a malformity. I barf at the very thought of you. You have all the appeal of a paper cut. Lepers avoid you. You are vile, worthless, less than nothing. You are a weed, a fungus, the dregs of this earth. You are a technicolor yawn. And did I mention that you smell?

You are a squeaking rat, a mistake of nature and a heavy-metal bagpipe player. You were not born. You were hatched into an unwilling world that rejects the likes of you. You didn't crawl out of a normal egg, either, but rather a mutant maggot egg rejected by an evil scientist as being below his low standards. Your alleged parents abandoned you at birth and then died of shame in recognition of what they had done to an unsuspecting world. They were a bit late.

You are a thick-headed trog. I have seen skeet with more sense than you have. You are a few bricks short of a full load, a few cards short of a full deck, a few bytes short of a full core dump, and a few chromosomes short of a full human. Worse than that, you top-post. God created houseflies, cockroaches, maggots, mosquitos, fleas, ticks, slugs, leeches, and intestinal parasites, then he lowered his standards and made you. I take it back; God didn't make you. You are Satan's spawn. You are Evil beyond comprehension, half-living in the slough of despair. You are the entropy which will claim us all. You are a green-nostriled, crossed eyed, hairy-livered, goisher kopf, inbred trout-defiler. You make Ebola look good.

You are a waste of flesh. You have no rhythm. You are ridiculous and obnoxious. You are the moral equivalent of a leech. You are a living emptiness, a meaningless void. You are sour and senile. You are a loathsome disease, a drooling inbred cross-eyed toesucker. You make Quakers shout and strike Pentecostals silent. You have a version 1.0 mind in a version 6.13 world. Your mother had to tie a pork chop around your neck just to get your dog to play with you. You think that www.GuyMacon.com/flame.html is the name of a rock band. You believe that P.D.Q. Bach is the greatest composer who ever lived. You prefer L. Ron Hubbard to Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle. Hee-Haw is too deep for you. You would watch test patterns all day if the other inmates would let you.

You are so clueless that if you dressed in a clue skin, doused yourself in clue musk, and did the clue dance in the middle of a field of horny clues at the height of clue mating season, you still would not have a clue. If you were a movie you would be a double feature; _Battlefield_Earth_ and _Moron_Movies_II_. You would be out of focus.

You are a fiend and a sniveling coward, and you have bad breath. You are the unholy spawn of a bandy-legged hobo and a syphilitic camel. You wear strangely mismatched clothing with oddly placed stains. You are degenerate, noxious and depraved. I feel debased just knowing that you exist. I despise everything about you, and I wish you would go away. You are jetsam who dreams of becoming flotsam. You won't make it. I beg for sweet death to come and remove me from a world which became unbearable when the bioterrorists designed you.

The only thing worse than your logic is your manners. I have snipped away most of your of what you wrote, because, well ... it didn't really say anything. Your attempt at constructing a creative flame was pitiful. I mean, really, stringing together a bunch of insults among a load of babbling was hardly effective... Maybe later in life, after you have learned to read, write, spell, and count, you will have more success. True, these are rudimentary skills that many of us ""normal"" people take for granted that everyone has an easy time of mastering. But we sometimes forget that there are ""challenged"" persons in this world who find these things to be difficult. If I had known that this was true in your case then I would have never have exposed myself to what you wrote. It just wouldn't have been ""right."" Sort of like parking in a handicap space. I wish you the best of luck in the emotional, and social struggles that seem to be placing such a demand on you.

We are doing a huge portion of the work of recruiting for MIT; there are a lot of students who literally would not be here right now if they hadn't come to CPW. Unfortunately, we are still bombarded with work the entire time. And the people who are most committed to making CPW great, who put in the most time and effort to help MIT, are the ones hurt the hardest. Students are forced into positions where they would have to literally miss class and skip psets in order to be able to run events, tours, and other parts of CPW. And when put in that position, those students often DO IT, because they love MIT and they care more about sharing that love with the prefrosh than they do about doing well in their classes. I think it's terrible how MIT repays them."

Call me Seven. Not related with my name. I am typical me. I am unique. Because I believe there's no other Seven in this world. But people could say I am lucky but they didn't know that I am just an ordinary girl. I am chinita. My mother says I have a certain kind of loveliness. Tall and I do have a white complexion. I joined beauty pageants when I was in my teen years. I'm not boasting myself. I'm just being myself. My parents separated when I am twenty. There's third party involved. So, as I go along, I realised that there's really no forever. Here my story goes: 
I met him online. To be specific on tagged. I don't know if you guys know it.  But I am pretty sure most of you does. I got star struck so I added him. I am single so I am searching friends online. And honestly, I love to have babies with blue eyes. (Ambisyosa! :D) I was glad when he accepted my request and we chatted from tagged to Skype. I told him my experience in love and how I was left broken by my  boy friends. He felt sad for me. Until we became close and I asked him to make a Facebook account so it would be easy for me to contact him. Months passed he courted me and I didn't reject him for I felt the same way too. But what made me sad when he asked me to show my b****. I'm not that type of girl so all our plans vanished. He even want me to travel to their place to meet him. Its really funny that I am the girl but he won't help me to come and see him. He would always say I am stupid. So, I let him go. And now I am still heartbroken. I know God has a plan for me. I may not be the girl he need but at least I'm not cheating on him. Weeks passed I learned that he  found a new girl from Philippines. I was being humiliated and betrayed that time. I walked to my cr and cried. I asked to myself ""why boys are all like that?"" I do hope he won't hurt her. As of now, we are chatting as friends. I don't know why I am so stupid to talk to him while I'm still hurt. They say that if two past lovers can remain friends, it's either they are still in love, or never were. I just hate myself for being stupid. Can I ask? Do I need to change myself? I am so conservative that almost everybody left me hanging.
To A :
Be the best that you can. I understand your needs. I am sorry for not giving you everything. I love you, goodbye."

3032,2016-04-08 14:38:14,"As far as I can tell, there are two common types of people who use dildo.io. Let individual examples of each be Alice and Bob. Alice has 50 people checkmarked on her dildo.io account, all of whom she'd be legitimately happy to fuck, though there are some people she is more interested in than others. She's happy to match even with people who have checkmarked literally everyone else in the interface. Meanwhile, Bob has maybe 1-3 people selected (and maybe Bob wouldn't even want to fuck all of them, but would be interested in some sort of hookup, or in dating, or whatever). Bob has his settings such that he won't be matched with someone interested in more than 10 other people, because it would be super awkward to be matched with someone when they're one of a few for him, but he's one of many for them.

So here, even if Alice and Bob would both love to hook up with one another, they don't get matched. I don't think either Alice or Bob are necessarily doing anything wrong, but the Alices and Bobs of dildo.io should just be aware that this is a common way for them to not get matches, and that no match != no interest."

I was with two friends of mine (girls) and I couldn't help but think: one of us is going to sexually assaulted. The whole day, I looked at groups of girls and thinking of the statistic. But I knew I couldn't get sexually assaulted. I was going to be responsible. Going to be in control of myself. My education on the matter was going to break the statistic. Then, I was sexually assaulted 2 months into my freshman year this year. I don't know what the point of this confession is. I haven't told anyone about my assault, so maybe it's me selfishly and cowardishly acknowledging what happened? I don't know. I don't know. But like 6 months later, it still sucks."

3046,2016-04-08 13:48:32,"@5247 OP, ""it's good for the children"" has been the excused used to force women into shitty conditions for centuries.
""The children need their mother at home, you shouldn't be working""
""You'll be a housewife one day, so college isn't worth it"" (unless it's an MRS degree)
""It's totally inappropriate for a married woman to work. Don't make your husband ashamed of his income""

To clarify for you, OP, divorce rates and birth control rose together because it was finally recognized that women have value beyond popping out babies and cooking assholes like yourself dinner. Birth control let women say ""no, I'm not having (more) kids, I'm having a career.""

Although, OP, if you're concerned about divorce, I'd suggest dropping out of college, convincing everyone in your life divorce is a mortal sin, and becoming fully economically dependent on your spouse. Then, no matter how poorly he/she treats you, I can guarantee you'll be less likely to file for divorce.

All right everyone, chill. I LOVE women, but that doesn't change the truth... It's isn't easy to be a stud. Few men like me who have earned that status get to brag, period. When I see a woman I like, I know she has the ultimate power to decide whether we will have sex or not. The onus is on me to make her desire me. The more women I try to impress, the higher my chances of getting laid- I've gotten pretty good at this shit. A woman doesn't need to work that hard for sex. She doesn't need to pursue many men to up her chances therefore if she gives so readily, she's a slut. It's not PC but it's true.

Let me now take on the haters.
""Who do you think those women that find getting laid so easy are getting laid by? "" - They are getting laid by men like me. Alpha males who can sweep them off their feet any time, any day. ;)

3061,2016-04-08 13:01:13,"@5384 Are you fucking kidding me? Sure, guys face some challenges in their attempts to get laid, but don't forget about all the stereotypes and gender roles that the society imposes on BOTH genders. Females have to be feminine, take really good care of their body and always look charming. It is a constant work and standards for girls are way higher than for guys. Besides, if a guy wants to get laid he just needs to come up to a girl and start a conversation. If a girl wants to get laid, she has to wait for a guy to get interested in her. Why? Because of fuckers just like you that would otherwise slut shame her.

Why don't we make it easier for both genders? Just treat males and females equally. If one wants to have sex, explore more sexual partners, or stay with one person, let them do that regardless of gender and don't shame anyone. Desire to have sex is perfectly normal. Slut shaming girls you make it harder for yourself to get laid: if a girl that sleeps with several guys is a slut, she has to be more selective and will reject you if you don't pass for a long-term relationship. Just don't be a dick, don't shame sluts and don't praise studs - let everyone make decisions they are comfortable with."

Some feminists claim that a woman who sleeps around shouldn't be slut-shammed, bullshit!
It's so easy for a woman to get laid. SO freaking easy! All she needs 
to do is to look nice and say the magic words. Done. Guys, on the other hand have to be 'charming',
tell lies, be funny, have a fake job, e.t.c to impress women, before they come close to getting laid. Therefore, a guy who can do this successfully with many women is a stud. Conversely, a woman who sleeps with many men is a slut.  Using the term slut is justified because it's so easy to be one.

3093,2016-04-07 01:48:15,"As someone how has been in protests before I want to let everyone know something about participating that seems to go over some peoples heads. If you get arrested or temporarily detained by police at them, DO NOT physically resist in any way. This means don't lie as dead weight, don't refuse to put your hands behind your back, don't spit on the officer, don't refuse to walk or get in the car. Even if it is an unlawful arrest, do not resist physically. If it is unlawful, by not resisting, and getting the information down, you set yourself up for a solid case in court of unlawful arrest. But if you resist, that alone is a crime in every jurisdiction, and the supreme court has ruled that the police have the legal right to use as much force as needed to detain you. Police usually interpret that as beating the resister as much as they think they can get away with. More importantly, the fact that you commit a crime there, will nullify your case for unlawful arrest regardless of the original reason, and on top of that you just got your ass kicked for nothing. I say this, because I've seen a few fools who resisted and got charges slapped against them while peacefully and lawfully protesting. I know it's wrong that the officer unlawfully arrests people, but you need to check your ego at the door. By staying cool and playing smart, not aggressive, you can win legal cases, and secure your rights."

3103,2016-04-07 01:59:27,"In response to the confession about feeling proud when you were buying a tampon while someone else was buying a pregnancy test...

I get that your confession was probably a joke but it reminded me of the time I had to buy a pregnancy test my freshman year.  (I'm a senior now for context and have only had sex with my then and current boyfriend.)  I was on the pill and those mess up your period really badly.  I knew this but I never suspected how badly my period would get messed up.  I missed my period for 4 months and I tried to remain calm at month 1, 2 and 3 but at month 4 I definitely flipped out.  I took a pregnancy test the last day before I left for the summer and my boyfriend and I discussed options before (i.e. whether I would have an abortion or not - I had to face the fact that I would probably get an abortion, which was a really painful realization for me).  I went off-campus to Shaw's because I was worried (apparently justifiably) about someone recognizing me and judging me for it.  I bought the test and a random magazine.  I threw the magazine on top of the test (which was stupid in retrospect - the cashier still saw the test when she scanned it and that trip cost more than it needed to).  I also refused to let my boyfriend stand with me in line.  It would look odd if we were standing in line next to each other buying a test.  I don't know man - it would just feel weird.  I immediately took the test in the bathroom while my boyfriend waited outside.  It came out negative.  I have since switched forms of birth control (for a few other reasons as well).  Condoms all the way for me!!!

But that was a stressful situation and it was made 10 times worse by the shame of the situation.  There is so much shame.  Hence my anonymity.  Anyway, just a random story I realized that I have never shared.  Not even with my best friend."

Stop feeling guilty for descending from the most ambitious and successful people to have walked this earth and have some goddamn pride in your ancestors.

You see certain minority groups such as gays and African-American are victims in our white straight society. Most of them due to obstacles put in front of them can't succeed without some extra help. That's where people like him and I come in. As straight white males it is our job to help make sure laws like this don't pass and give victims a boost when we can.

3170,2016-04-07 01:09:39,"@5240 I'm born and raised Asian with the whole crazy high school competition and parents thing, and I can tell you two things. 

One, there is always someone here more disciplined, smarter, with a better background than you. 

Second, I wish I was raised by someone else. I wish that I had been taught how to value something besides academics. I wish I hadn't spent my entire high school career studying. I wish I played more sports, talked to girls more. There is so much else to life, but I have trouble seeing it because my I get all down when I get a bad test grade, or get rejected from an internship.

So, yea, I think we all want to be what we aren't."

3176,2016-04-07 01:09:55,"I'm a senior who moved to EC this year and it's pretty nice. I lived in Simmons my freshman year and wasn't feeling that. Lived off campus and then decided to move back to campus. EC has been my favorite dorm by far (I've unofficially lived aka psetted a bunch in other west campus dorms and Senior House).  There's a pretty strong culture and it's an old building, but everyone is really respectful and generally welcoming. I really haven't had any problems. I just wish I had moved here earlier so I could have enjoyed it more. 

When I see the confessions bashing EC I feel sorry that those people feel so upset about EC.  I hope they find a place that works for them. But they should realize that EC doesn't suck, it's just not the place for them.  Just like Simmons doesn't suck, it just wasn't the place for me."

Also, if leave your hall, you get shunned. Join an FSILG other than tEp or pika, get shunned. This isn't everyone, not even close, but certain people tend to perpetuate this vibe.

3192,2016-04-05 18:37:26,"Have any of the class council candidates followed through on the things they promised in their platforms? Let's take Jonathon Brown for instance, he promised (copy pasted verbatim from his campaign facebook page):

• More online resources for PSETS and reference materials
• A “Find a PSET Partner” match at the start of classes
• Work on one homogenous system (Stellar vs. MITx vs.?)
• Potential mixers with other schools in the area
• Student-Faculty Mixers
• I will personally visit one dorm a week and see if people want to talk about what’s working (Ripes) and what needs improvement (Gripes)

Among a whole host of other events that also haven't happened. Sure, some of these things are a little ambitious (did anyone believe class council could integrate stellar and MITx lol), but is it really that difficult to send out email surveys (which he also promised) and visit dorms every now and then?

Maybe class council really is only good for selecting poor sweater designs, and free food every month or so.

P.S. don't mean to rip on Brown, he just so happens to be the only member of the 2019 council that I know the name of lol, again speaking to their effectiveness."

3194,2016-04-05 18:17:28,"I had a very empowering realization today that has really relieved a lot of stress. I gave up caring about getting good grades just for the sake of competition, both with classmates and the material itself, as soon as I left high school because I knew that the classes here were going to be much more difficult and that the intelligence level of all of my peers would be greater than or equal to (although most likely just strictly greater than) mine. Still though, I stressed about my GPA because I didn't want it to prevent me from getting a job. But I just realized, I don't really care about that either. The absolute worst case scenario is that my transcript is so shitty that I can't get a single job related to my major, in which case I can just move back to my hometown and get some blue-collar job, which is what all of my friends from high school are already doing, and is an option I already consider all the time anyways, even when I'm doing well in all my classes. I've realized that I'm really in a win-win situation, and boy what a freeing realization that has been."
3195,2016-04-05 18:58:31,"I feel so intensely relieved after talking to my therapist about ADD. It's like this constant guilt of not being able to work hard enough, do enough, discipline myself enough is lifted and its not because I won't still feel these, its just there's actually a way to improve it and its not for my lack of trying.  She said ""You didn't come here to suffer.  It's college, you're free!"" and told me to go do some sport that I'd always wanted to do, or pick up doodling in class more if it helps.  It just feels so nice to have someone understand something that's been eating away at your belief in your ability to accomplish anything for so long. 10/10 would recommend."

3205,2016-04-05 18:16:54,"I just graduated here a year ago and I have a great job now thanks to the internships I did here. I have grown worried at the movement to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour that I've witnessed over the past year because of where I was. When I started my first job here freshman year I had no real skills and got minimum wage. It was lousy pay for lousy work but it got my foot in the door. I got some skills and the next internship took me because of the first one for double the minimum wage. The third took me for more, then after graduating I got a good business job for good pay and benefits which they agreed to because of my experience. Nobody would have hired me the first time for $15 an hour because I was not worth it, I would have been stuck either doing an unpaid internship, or none at all. Some people argue that minimum wage is not a living wage. Of course it's not, that's the point. Minimum wage jobs are not about making a living, they are about giving workers with no skills a foot in the door to begin building them. Plus most low wage jobs are in industries such as restaurants and supermarkets that are very low margin businesses that rely on low wages to stay profitable. When you raise the minimum wage you make the workers with the least skills compete against workers with more skills and the low skills ones take the punishment. Employers will either hire fewer low level workers, cut their hours, or both as a result. So please don't push for a higher minimum wage, it may feel good, but it does not do good."
3206,2016-04-05 18:08:55,"There's one question I keep getting asked a lot that I want to answer. I don't attempt to hide the fact that I am against birth control. Most people look at me shocked when I answer and ask how is that possible? It's very safe and effective. Physically yes, but there's more to it. The main reason I am against it is its psychological effects. When people are able to no longer worry about producing children from sex they seek pleasure as oppose to a partner who is actually good for them in a relationship. Do you think it's some coincidence that divorce and birth control use rose together in the 20th century in lock step? This in turn leads to widespread family breakdown which is statistically proven to lead to children who are more likely to live in poverty and do prison time. In short, it makes for a selfish population that thinks little for those around them, and only for themselves. For those of you who will angrily respond to this that it's none of my business what pleasure you seek and from whom, ask yourself should you be doing it? Sometimes doing the right thing means giving up what we want and doing what's right for everyone else."

There's no shame in anonymity. Anonymity is good! It fights groupthink and encourages honesty. I have opinions that I wouldn't express publicly, not because I'm scared of backlash, but because I value my relationship with people who I'd offend. And I don't think that's dishonest, I think it's socially conscionable, respectful, and human.

So don't attack people for not having the ""courage"" to state something publicly, even if there are sassy style points to be won. There are lots of reasons why they might prefer this forum."

Every day, I come in contact with students from mostly Chinese and Korean background and the more I find out about their upbringing, the more I get intimidated and ashamed whenever they demonstrate how much better and smarter they are. 

I never had to work hard (until I got here, of course) . My competition in high school was sparse, and all my peers were lazy slackers and braindead American idiots. My teachers didn't care enough to hold me to real standards. My parents indulged me with distractions, constant praise, and instant gratification. I got to MIT and I realized I've become this useless pleasure-seeker because I was raised by entitled, complacent Westerners.

All the Asians I know were raised to be focused and quick witted. They're more motivated. They have many more years of practice and infinitely more discipline. They look out for their own. Their brains are better wired for symbolic patterns and memory as most of them are bilingual. Their ancestors didn't commit disgusting crimes against humanity like mine. Their culture is the best in the world. I was raised all wrong and I'm guilty about how inferior I must appear to these people. Just fuck my life up. 

Asians will inherit the world."

I interpreted it as: you're only nice to them so they'll be nice to you. Naturally, I got really offended and angry at them. It's normal to expect someone you care about to care about you equally. And it's hurtful when you realize they don't. But I thought about what they said after a while and realized they were right in some ways. If I noticed that someone didn't treat me like how I treated them, I would pretty much cut them out because I thought they weren't worth my time. But then I also realized that I didn't want to be someone like that: someone who only fosters relationships to get something back. I don't think I ever really changed anything, but after realizing that I had some relationship issues, I've been a lot happier with my friends. I like myself a lot more too."

Pretty much nothing. I don't have genuine friends anymore. I have people that want things from me. Maybe it's always been like that and I'm just picking up on that now, but either way it's a shitty way to be. I won't enjoy my major. I'm not interested in anything like other people here. I no longer find enjoyment in solving problems. I don't have that feeling of accomplishment you get after something ""clicks"" in your head. I only have my thoughts. I'm going to finish. All I have is the prospect of making my parents proud of me. You don't care. You will never know who I am and I will just be another kid. That's life I guess."

3256,2016-04-04 19:32:32,"People Over P-Sets is such a fucking lie, I used to heavily believe in it and care about people around me but the issue is that no one else really does that, I mean not to say zero people do it, but everyone I know who claims to care would routinely ignore me just cause they were busy or whatnot. A large part of this is probably me, aka I've known from a very young age that no one really gives a shit about me, idk if I'm uninteresting or annoying or even worse as a combo of the two but it's just always been that way, aka I was always the little girl in the playground who didn't know anyone. Most recently it seems like the I'm viewed that way b/c ppl, whether it be guys or my girl friends, just don't find me attractive but I figure that's just a age-dependent manifestation of the general not wanting to be around me that's been around me my entire life. The funny thing is my mom always used to tell me growing up that the only person who you can count on to care about you is yourself and in my naivete and belief in good ppl I chose to think she was just wrong or being sad, but I increasingly think it's true. Anyway, back to the main point, I never really minded when ppl, literally everyone around me, would clearly not care about me over here becuase the magic of MIT made me feel that maybe for once in my life there might be ppl who care about me, esp. with such a push for people over psets. In fact, for the most part, I didn't even realize they didn't care until recently when I realized they were all going to be gone faster than I had met them once I graduate. They don't give a shit and never really did, but here I was foolishly investing care into them despite knowing that I'm just the type of person that it's impossible to care about. The worst part is I've gone through this literally at every school I've been to and have no real friends from 'back home', and despite that I managed to fall into the same trap that I always do thinking that this is some magical place where ppl care. I've repeated this mistake so many times that it can be described as nothing less than insanity, and well, I feel pretty fucking insane. Now I wish I had done psets and gotten better grades/rest instead of wasting time on them. It's too late for me, but for everyone out there, people leave, they always will, but your grades matter more, so don't let people take advantage of you both emotionally and in terms of time, because it will come back to burn you.

P.S.- Please don't any of you dare to suggest Mental Health or Lean on Me or any other thing like that because I literally just wrote a whole post about how I was stupid for trusting people, and I'm sure as hell not going to make the same mistake of thinking someone cares for me with a random stranger"

3267,2016-04-04 19:29:57,"@5085 I agree. those apps are well-intentioned but pretty useless except maybe at bringing out conversations on mental health. I feel like we focus so heavily on mental health, we induce people to be sad. I mean if I get mental health messages everywhere, it makes it out to be like everyone's always suffering. In all that doom and gloom, I can't stay too happy. The hyper-focus on mental health makes mental health worse. Yes, we need to have resources, but I don't want that to be the only thing we do here. I mean grow up a bit. The real world is also super stressful, we have to learn to deal with it."
3268,2016-04-04 19:20:59,"@5085 Yes, and no. Yes you have to do something to get out of or better manage your mental illness. No, it's not as fucking simple as focus on your work and try harder at school. 

That something that you do to get out might be meds, or keeping a calendar, or keeping alarms on your phone to help stay focused. And it might also be TMAYD, Lean on Me, etc. Those apps aren't helpful to me personally, but I can easily see that for someone who needs it, that might be the first step in reaching out, the first step in getting better and focusing on school. And simply because it does not help me, doesn't mean it's useless.

Because even reaching out on those platforms is doing something, whatever you can in that state to get out. 

Your depression does not encompass everyone's struggles. You do not understand what everyone else is going though, so don't you dare try to minimize it.

You were able to cajole yourself out of it--fine. But people are not weak for seeking help. People are not weak for not being able to bring themselves out of it. I'm not sure why we glorify the whole not seeking help and pushing though on your own. Guys, we're really lucky in that we have so many good people in the community who would like to help. Lean on them, tell them about your day, seek out the help you need so you can focus better on school."

He could illegally spy on U.S. citizens. He could have an affair with a White House staffer. He could bug the offices of political opponents and people he was suspicious of. He could attempt to covertly overthrow foreign governments. He could force an entire race of people to relocate, essentially resulting in genocide.

I haven't been to lecture for all but one of my classes for like the past 2 or 3 weeks, and for one of my classes I've never even been to recitation. It started because I had to skip class in order to finish the problem sets due later that day since I waited so long to start working on them, but now I'll just skip for no reason at all. I know I'd definitely be better off just going, but the combination of the lecture notes/slides being on line and me knowing that even if I do go I probably won't pay attention make it so difficult to justify going.

How should I go about getting this under control? It would be great if one of you over-achievers could build a time machine or something and let me use it to just start the semester over, but since that's probably asking a little much, could anyone just give me some advice on what to do?

PLEASE PLEASE. BETTER RESTAURANTS AT STUDENT CENTER!!!!!!

MIT board members need to dine at every restaurant in Student Center and realize that we students are literally eating oily, stale, salty trash food, and then they should head over to Boston University Student Center and compare how BU students eat normal food with variety. It sounds like a small deal, BUT IT ISN'T. When students have lots of work to do and need to grab a quick eat on campus, do you know how DEPRESSING IT IS TO EAT STALE TERIYAKI CHICKEN DRIPPING WITH OIL???? Food is a major source of happiness for many of us, and we are eating trashy food. All of my friends I have talked to agrees with me on this. MIT says it cares about student mental health and created some programs that basically say ""you can come talk to me...""; however, these programs focus on treating the symptoms rather than solving the problems because the overall quality of life for students remains low.

i cant help but think the kid just needs to make more friends, since he came from a town that was all but 3% white. i had a professor tell me once he was once like this kid, came from a rural town where everyone was white, and he changed after having a roommate who was a gay black male during his time in college, and learning about him. i hope it's really true that people can change this way, and that they just need to be exposed to more people with different experiences. 

i know that was my experience when it came to certain issues, i was able to see that problems and national issues are not so dichotomous as we would like to perceive, though it certainly would make decisions easier, that people don't all have the same experience or circumstances when it comes to facing problems, and ultimately i changed my views."

Drama aside -- my heart goes out to this chick right now (trending-- she has discovered second-hand that her fiancé has cheated on her multiple times. Iggy's relationship was something far removed from her career; she was deeply in love with this man). 

Finding out a loved one has betrayed your trust is absolutely one of the most painful things a person can be subjected to. Drama aside about her career. I was cheated on too, and I still recall the terrible, terrible pain, coupled with the agonizing insecurity that lasted for more than a year after first finding out, I am truly sorry for the hurt she must be feeling right now. 

I know it seems easier to cheat, you guys.... but seriously, a fight with your partner about sex/your relationship is 1000x better than choosing to lie. The truth always comes out. The cheater starts to lose self-esteem because they know they are doing wrong to another. The person who is cheated on... their soul is torn completely to shreds. I'm not exaggerating.

Do the technical parts of it work quickly and efficiently? Yup, got a response within 15 minutes, had a long conversation with the volunteer. Is it well intentioned? Of course! Was it actually helpful? Well...

However, I can't shake the feeling that the volunteer who I chatted with was a caring, well-intentioned person, but they seemed a little canned, a lot more sympathy than empathy. I told them about struggling to find any willpower to wake up from my bed everyday, and how much I hated myself for not being able to do work. They gave me gems of advice like, ""maybe it will be better and less intimidating if you break up your work into smaller pieces!""

I told them that while this advice was correct and sound, it still wasn't *helpful.* I told them that they were doing good work by being a volunteer for this, but that they didn't really understand the level of despair I was going through. After a bit of a pause, they told me that I should probs go to Medical again, and didn't say much else.

Should I expect that the volunteers have a deep understanding of what it means to be ridden with depression and anxiety? It's probably not fair, but I was hoping that the support would feel more genuine, and less like it was out of a pamphlet.

And that's the general impression I get of Lean On Me, both its creators and its volunteers: well-intentioned, but a bit shallow. Hopefully others have had different experiences, but my interaction didn't offer much beyond the sea of information about campus mental health that we're constantly bombarded by."

In terms of tips, a lot of people find something physical grounding. For example, eating an orange (which smells a lot) or stomping your feet. Interacting with someone who knows you well and to whom you are comfortable disclosing your symptoms can also help. Finally, please get help. I don't want to scare you, but for me depersonalization has preceded some really alarming behavior and thoughts. My thoughts are with you, OP."

Ida Green Tea sessions and oh my gosh /literally/ everyone from eaps was there, and I don't use the word literally wro- wait there was one person who wasn't there. Yeah... that one grad student whose door I unlocked on the 18th floor. It wasn't like I used magic on it or anything, I had the actual key to it because the radar gear was in the room, and for some other reason that person was there. Yeah... talk about awkward.

3495,2016-03-29 16:11:31,"There's something I've noticed in abortion debates. Pro-choicers in arguments with pro-lifers always bring up how banning abortions would be an attack on women's rights in the form of denying them bodily autonomy, place women who can't support children in poverty, further traumatize pregnant rape survivors, etc. Now as a pro-choicer, I believe that these are absolutely important, legitimate issues. However, in the specific context of an argument with a pro-lifer, bringing any of that up is utterly irrelevant. Why? Because the other person literally believes that abortion is baby murder. They are not going to consider baby murder to be a human right. They are not going to think subjecting someone to poverty is worse than baby murder. Even the prospect of traumatizing rape survivors, horrible as that is, pales in comparison to baby murder. What should actually be the main point in an argument like this is the issue of personhood - what it is and when it begins, that aborted fetuses are not persons. If you're gonna attempt the almost insurmountable task of convincing someone on the other side of an issue as controversial as abortion to your side, you should at least first and foremost fully and truly understand how they think."

For example, the Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt was actually an early socialist state. How so, you ask, despite the proletariat not even coming into being until centuries and centuries later? Because it had the Library of Alexandria, and as we all know, public libraries are inherently socialist. Unfortunately, the Library was burned down by Julius Caesar, and the Kingdom itself was later annexed by the Romans. But all was not lost. For the Roman Empire was socialist as well! Yes, it was an absolute monarchy whose economy was literally powered by slaves, but it also possessed a system of public roads. Public roads, as we know, are a prime example of democratic socialism. Now, there are some deluded people out there who believe that socialism is actually something about ""social ownership of the means of production,"" whatever the hell that means. But don't worry! These revisionist fools shall be hunted down by our socialist police forces and socialist US military, so that true socialism can be protected!

I have been to therapy a few times before, but my issues have never been taken seriously. I must deal with this on my own because people will just think I am lazy and lack will-power.

I am proud of myself for getting into an amazing university and doing well in spite of the total lack of guidance in my life. I love what I study, and that alone is probably what has kept me alive.

The day a person like this - with no morals, no integrity, no courage, no shame, no respect, no honesty, no decency, no limits - can actually be ahead in a PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN is a day I never thought I'd see. He's cruel and he is narcissistic, he's a bully and a mocker. He wears whatever colors will get him the most publicity - Christianity is a selling point? He's suddenly a Christian (one that knows next to nothing about the bible, one that acts and speaks in ways our God would NEVER approve of, one that was making fun of Christians thru all the years before it became beneficial to him to pretend to be one). He's not the cause of this rampant racism and hypocrisy and bigotry. I'd never give him that much credit. What he's done is find the very lowest level of the human heart, where hatred and cruelty and cowardice lives, and he's brought that rot up into the light. He's made racism acceptable. He's made bigotry acceptable. He's made indecency acceptable. He's made utter cruelty to others acceptable. He's made mocking people for their religion or their gender or their physical challenges acceptable. He's made cuddling up with Putin acceptable. He's made verbal vomit acceptable. He just brought out what til now was kept hidden. And guess what?? It should've stayed hidden. Do you  have a son who would have to go off to fight this man's wars? Do you have a daughter who deserves a safe country and a sane president?  People fed up with their own party unleash Trump on us all and we all will have to pay for their anger at their own party. This is not a good man. This is not a decent man. This is not an honest man. This is not a peace-loving man. This is not a Christian man. This is not a brave man. Mocking Christianity, unfaithful in marriage, dodged the draft FIVE TIMES, bankruptcy, talks about having sex with his daughter, laughing at the pain and misfortune of others.....I will never, ever, ever be able to understand how this country stooped to a level so low as to give this man a podium and microphone and a big rabid, blood-thirsty fan club.

3555,2016-03-29 16:28:31,"So after seeing that post on nationalism, I thought people who post a lot of political stuff on here might want to watch this: https://www.ted.com/talks/jonathan_haidt_on_the_moral_mind?language=en

tl;dr liberals tend to value not harming others and fairness over authority, in-group loyalty, and purity whereas conservatives are the opposite.

While I'm pretty liberal (read: extremely) and don't agree with everything in the video, I think it was valuable to understand what conservatives value and why they might believe that certain things (e.g. nationalism) are more important than others (e.g. being humanitarian). Though I may not agree that they are more important, I can see why people support authority, purity, and loyalty--these kinds of things are what helps hold our society together. Just being nice is not always enough to build something--you need rules too (obviously you need to be nice when you have rules though...both parts are necessary to create a real society). Conservatives tend to value what has been established in the past, and what people in authority say--because that's what keeps society stable. Liberals realize the status quo has problems and tries to change that, but conservatives don't like it because it's destroying what has been built or betraying the group that they belong to. Both sides are important, and I think we need to do better to understand what goals and values we have in common and use that to better understand each other, rather than writing people off as completely irrational. 

To the conservatives out there though, I also want to say that I hope you can try to understand why liberals might value avoiding harm and being fair more than following established norms. Established norms are often flawed based on who was in power in the past, and result in unfair treatment of many groups of people. And ultimately, @the nationalism person, I think diversity and connecting with other people is a good thing because things like countries and races are really just arbitrary borders we've decided when in truth we are all just human beings on one team. What reason do we have for competing with other countries when there are things we could learn from each other and help each other with. I think nationalism has its cons in that many people support their country blindly, despite its flaws, and treat other countries as competitors or enemies when we should be working together."

I've been told to put myself out there and I have, but I like to be somewhat creative in most things I do. So, why not try that here? Welcome to the MIT Confessions-Connect Game (MIT-CCG) for short. My goal with this game is to meet a girl with whom I share commons interests and get along with. I'm not necessarily looking for a relationship, but just someone to connect with and if all goes well, maybe a relationship will be the outcome.

MIT-CCG Rules:

** Rules change accordingly depending on your sexual orientation. These is my post and I'm a straight guy. **

1) I will compare 2 situations that can happen with a guy and a girl. It can be any 2 situations. The only thing you have to do is type a "">"" or ""<"" sign between the 2 situations. A greater than sign means that this situation is more favorable for you.  For instance:

""When a guy tries to hold my hand on the 2nd date > When a guy tries to kiss on the 1st date""

2) Now, if a girl from MIT agrees with this situation, please comment on the confession with anything you want to say. Just make sure you indicate somehow that you are consenting to play the game. If you simply want to comment, then just comment. Remember guys, ""no means no!""

So now that the OP has stated his 2 situations and has seen that a girl(s) has commented (with consent) on the post, he may proceed with step 3.

3) This step requires a messenger app. Now you message the girl(s) that you are interested in and give her your user name. I will use Wickr since it's confidential.

4) Then you guys can talk and connect. And maybe eventually skype and get to know each other more. Who knows ? :)

Anyone can make their own MIT-CCG Post. I know that this version of the game probably has holes in it and may be an epic fail. So, if anyone can improve on the game, please do and write it on your Confessions Post.

Since I created this game, I will go by the name, OP-IHTFP. If you improve on the game, feel free to create a name for yourself. Now that I explained the rules, I will continue with my situations.

When a guy gives you a handmade gift for Valentine's Day (assuming it isn't generic) > When he buys you a gift (assuming it isn't a Ferrari)."

1. I was annoyed more than anything that the note was anonymous so I was unable to address what the real noise issue was (bed, voice) with the author.
2. I was annoyed at the tone of the note. It was very angry and rude, and I was previously completely unaware I could be heard from the floor below. The author could have at least said ""please.""
3. I was annoyed the note had been posted on my door for all the world to see rather than discreetly slipped under my door.
4. I live in a dorm where I cannot hear voices on other floors, so I assume it was the bed banging against the wall that was the issue, not my voice. In that case, the word ""loud"" didn't make much sense. I could have been completely silent and it wouldn't make a difference.
5. I often hear people having sex on the floor above (beds banging) but it's really not that loud, and doesn't bother me. When my neighbors do, however, it does. Pro tip: earplugs. I do it and do not complain. I expect the same courtesy from others.
6. Sorry if I've offended you with the tone of my previous post. I was angry.
7. NO I AM NOT ACTUALLY SORRY FOR MY SEX LIFE. If that wasn't clear :)
8. But I do feel bad for women who are not able to enjoy sex as much as I do. I truly wish everyone was as capable."
3571,2016-03-29 15:47:13,"I realize that TAs have lots of students, but after recently becoming a TA and realizing that memorizing names is really not that difficult, I have to get this off my chest. I’m pretty bothered by the fact that every time my TAs hand things back, they always have to ask what my name is, and I’m pretty sure it’s because I’m Asian. Today when I was getting a math pset back, my TA knew the names of everyone in the class except the Asians. This has happened more than once, and I feel like by now, he’d know all of our names. I’m not just targeting him; I’m saying in most cases, white TAs never know Asian students’ names. Granted, I’ve had one white TA who knew my name, but for the large majority, I’ve always had to tell them my name.
I know that people usually have an easier time recognizing people of their own race, but seriously – learn the students’ names! I feel so awkward whenever they hand things out because they’ll hand back my friends’ papers with no trouble at all, but when they get to me, they’ll say, “Sorry, what’s your name again?” It’s like – bruh, I’ve been at every single recitation, and I actually participate/answer your questions. This is the 5th time you’ve asked. Idk if there’s anything to do about it; just had to get this off my chest. It makes me really grateful for the TAs who memorize everyone’s name after the first week, but it also makes me sad because I feel like I’m not memorable at all – just another Asian at MIT."

3630,2016-03-15 20:18:12,"I feel like kind of an asshole for how lazy I am as a grader. Most of the students spend so much time making sure their pset is formatted super well and they explain every step they're doing, but I just skip over all that and look to see if they have the right answer, and only investigate any further if their answer is wrong. And if the problem is something that wasn't covered when I took the class, I just give them full credit if their answer even slightly resembles the answer in the solution key. The students definitely benefit from my half-assed approach in terms of their grade, but I just think about how much time they're wasting writing out explanations for each step of their work that no one will ever even read. In a perfect world I'd love to read through everything and give insightful comments, but when I have my own work to do and I'm only being paid for 15 minutes of grading per pset, that's just not going to happen.

So I guess for the students whose psets I grade: sorry you're wasting your time doing work I never actually read, but also you're welcome for me giving you full credit for some work that I would probably realize is incorrect if I actually read it."

Believe me, what other people think isn't why I wear a bra. It's because I will literally be in pain if I don't wear one, and wearing a properly fitted, right-sized bra has been a life saver for me (shoutout to r/abrathatfits), and I love my bras.

Our economy goes to shit with austerity measures and trickle down economics. Traditional family values once again villify the remainder of the LGBTQ community that hasn't already fled. Whites once again convince themselves that it is normal for them to be at an advantage in many ways and to merely suggest they have this advantage is ""being divisive"" and ""pulling the race card."" The government is once again a small affair with the EPA, IRS, CDC, and TSA cut. Hell why not just go the whole way and cut Congress, the Supreme Court, and the President out of it. They don't deserve our taxpayer dollars!! The media is dominated by Fox News and TheBlaze. People stop watching TV and using the Internet and other disgusting leftist implements like cellphones and writing and start communicating via good ole' traditional grunts and the occasional fart for emphasis. Where did original communication values go?? Winning is good again and telling everybody else that they can win if they work hard in our *totally equal* opportunity society is the norm.

This is all possible. Please keep your word and move to Canada.

Then this semester I was having some issues that I wasn't as used to dealing with and I felt really dumb for letting issues that were so small comparatively to what Im used to dealing with affect me so much. I couldnt get out of bed, I was sleeping for 12+ hours a night and just sitting staring at blank psets for hours, I finally decided to go to S^3 when I weighed myself and I'd lost 15 lbs, and had realized I hadnt had anything but coffee in over a week. I went there in shitty PJ's and i hadnt showered in quite some time. I'm sitting in the waiting area waiting for James Collins (an angel) and Ayida comes out and proceeds to sit right next to me as Im almost in tears in the corner, She proceeds to tell me about how lucky I have it being here and how I'm only a freshman and if im already having issues this place is going to destroy me and that its just not for everyone. Sitting there I really regretted going to S^3 and honestly was contemplating asking for withdrawl because i was so depressed and I just didnt want to be around people. Luckily James came and got me from the waiting area said complete opposite and helped me actually get back on track and everything is still a little rough but Im doing a lot better now and went from failing to passing almost all of my classes."

It just made Lobby 7 look ugly, much unlike the fun things occasionally done to Lobby 7 that, I don't know, actually took effort. To be fair, she has ideas and she cares, I just think she goes about it in a very annoying manner.

While I don't want to dismiss people's horrifyingly negative experiences with certain deans, I wanted to share one of mine that typifies my interactions with S^3. About two weeks ago was the first anniversary of a friend's death. For about two days, I bounced from one friends room to another just trying to keep my spirits up. I didn't try to do any work because I knew I didn't have it in me to do it. Unfortunately, I was already looking at a hell week.

I went to S^3 walk in hours and met with Dean Feller. I briefly explained what was bothering me and told her that I needed two or three deadlines pushed back a week. She had me email my professors and cc her. When a prof requested S^3, support she quickly replied to back me up. 

I've used S^3 a couple other times to the same effect. It saddens me to see that some people have not been so lucky, but I wanted to provide a positive story so hopefully people don't completely rule it out as a resource."

Sure, those people are very impressive and should be respected, but there's more to people than concrete measurements of accomplishment. 

MIT is an amazing place filled with high-achieving people, but this emphasis on achievement is too pervasive. I wish we could spend more time valuing and appreciating other attributes of people that matter more, like generosity or humility or bravery or kindness.

Traditional family values take society off of its death spiral and return it to a time when men, women, and children coexisted beneficially. Whites stop apologizing for being successful and stop capitulating to the whims of a vocal minority. The government is once again a small affair, and it concerns itself less with the workings of its citizens' lives and more with solidifying America's status in the world economically and ideologically. The media drops its leftist agenda. People stop watching the TV and start reading newspapers again. Winning is no longer a bad word; protecting your family and your nation is the honorable thing to do; veterans are again held in high esteem; charity is the new welfare, not least because manufacturing is a renewed American enterprise as a result of improved trade deals.

I had As in my other classes, I was on P/NR, and I'm a first-generation student that had never taken a real physics course. I was trying so fucking hard. I spent hours in my room crying about that interaction, then was advised by a friend to go to S^3. 

So I called and made an appointment and went in to see Ayida. Within 10 minutes, she had me in tears and was telling me that I never should have come to MIT if I didn't think I could handle a bad grade. The more I tried to explain that I didn't mind my B at all, that I was just upset about my adviser and was looking to see if there were opportunities for physics tutoring, the more she claimed that I wasn't cut out for MIT and that I should complete transfer applications as soon as possible. I cried a lot more back in my room, and I did what I was told. I completed transfer applications. I had to go in to get her to look over the applications as she'd requested a couple times, and every time she made me feel worse about myself. I didn't end up transferring, thank goodness, because I figured I had made it a little ways and could keep going in order to not have to go home and be the MIT dropout after everybody had been so excited that I'd gotten in in the first place. I've been back to S^3 a lot since, actually. Gerardo is a fantastic human being and is truly compassionate and helpful (also Evan at the front desk is truly an angel). But every time I go in and see Ayida, I get incredibly anxious and worry that she'll recognize me and ask why I'm still here."

I thought that with each  pset and project I would learn and get better...Well now it's nearly halfway through the semester and it seems like I'm still where I was in the beginning. It's not that I don't spend enough time studying. I probably spend double the time most people take to code something, study for a test or finish a pset. But somehow, even with all my classes and UROP and projects, I don't feel like I'm actually learning new things. I'm not getting any faster at figuring stuff out and my breadth of knowledge is not expanding fast enough to keep up with my UROP. I used to think I was a fast learner but this just seems like a painfully slow process

I kept falling behind in my work and went to S^3. I met with Ayida, and I explained to her my situation. She proceeded to tell me that the rape should not be taking that much of a toll on my schoolwork and that if I couldn't handle the GIRs then I didn't belong at MIT. She obviously refused to advcoate for extensions in my classes. I failed most of my classes that semester and was put on academic probation. It took me that semester and the following summer to pick myself back up. I still have flashbacks and I still have problems sleeping. I never returned to S^3 for anything. I've learned that for all the fake support MIT claims to offer the truth of the matter is, MIT will only help you if there is a possibility you can sue them. It is now my senior year and I have been accepted into my dream graduate school. Fuck you, Ayida. I do belong here, YOU DON'T."
3677,2016-03-14 09:42:33,"I still don't know how to make my confession appear on the MIT confessions facebook page. If you're reading this on facebook, then I guess I figured it out?"
3678,2016-03-14 09:25:35,"Why I enjoy being a MIT student is because people would just look at me in awe. It made more motivated to prove that I'm worthy of it, though I don't always get straight A's. As long I understand every concept of the lectures, I just know I will be fine. Scores are not everything."
3679,2016-03-14 09:15:38,"My Ayida story: I saw Ayida once because my regular dean was out of town. I told her I was having interpersonal issues that were impeding my work, but she did not accept that. So I reluctantly told her I had recently been sexually assaulted, something I did not want to share since my other dean already knew. Yet she would not accept that. I was only offered assistance once I had detailed the entire assault. It was incredibly painful. I still communicate with my dean occasionally over email, but I have not set foot in S^3 since."
3680,2016-03-14 09:52:39,"While we are on the subject of S^3, I just wanted to take a second to shout out to the 2 deans who I have personally seen - Gerardo Garcia-Rios and James Collins - who have been absolutely amazing, and whom I cannot thank enough for their support. Apparently Dean Collins started out his career studying CS before deciding that he wanted to pursue mental health and counseling, which is cool, and makes him a bit more relatable in my mind. I think you can request a specific dean if you make the appointment in advance, so I totally recommend either of them if you are worried about having a bad experience.. both of them are wonderful and I really felt like they genuinely cared. Also, another shoutout to Evan Heisman for being such a kind and calming person to deal with when setting up appointments. :)"
3681,2016-03-14 09:43:41,"While we're all sharing S^3 confessions... I went to S^3 freshman year after some stuff happened and I needed to miss class. My dean (not going to call anyone out specifically) immediately jumped to suggesting I take the rest of the semester off, or at least get my finals moved/excused. All I wanted was a note from S^3 excusing my mandatory attendance class and maybe allowing me to be late on a pset. Instead, I found my dean was incredibly emotionally manipulative, making me think I couldn't handle what had happened and needed more drastic measures (going to mental health, time off, regular meetings). I wondered (and still do) if this sort of emotional manipulation is why so many MIT students are dependent on S^3 deans. 

I made up some lame excuse about having a meeting and eventually ghosted them when the dean kept asking for follow-up meetings, and never went back, even when stuff got rough over the next four years. Terrified the hell out of me."

“I refuse to believe and MIT student is a Trump supporters, otherwise the admissions committee loses all credibility” 

“Trump's supporters are as much of joke as Trump himself”

“the American people are not dumb enough to elect a racist, bigoted, misogynistic, xenophobic, financially insecure, incompetent, fascist piece of humanoid waste like Trump”

it just renews my support for Trump. People accuse him of arrogance, but don’t they see the irony in their own sneering sense of intellectual and moral superiority? No, I don’t care much for social change, being a caretaker of the world, or unifying, empowering rhetoric. In fact, the more abrasive the rhetoric, the better-- never trust pretty words from a politician.

I care about lower taxes and economic opportunities to help myself and my family. I want this country to assert itself and bully itself back to economic superiority if it has to. When my parents jumped through all the hoops to earn their American citizenships, why should illegals be able to just waltz across the border? How can people deny Islam has more religious extremists than other religions? Lastly, let’s stop the hysteria. Even if you hate his rhetoric, the majority of his positions are very moderate, and the extreme ones will never be anything more than a negotiating starting point at best (an ideological zealot like Bernie wouldn’t get anything passed)."

So I emailed my professors and let them know that I'd be speaking with Ayida, and in response Ayida sent them all an email saying that she hadn't endorsed my request, and couldn't confirm my words. I called her to clarify what had happened, and she was livid. She said that this was academic dishonesty, that I had used her name without her approval and I could be reported. Now, I had just been discharged from the hospital and was already not in the best state of mind, but this just freaked me out more. She told me I could come in and sort it out within the next half hour (I don't even know why it had to be in person, but she made it clear that I had to get out of bed and make my way to S3 through all the ice and snow to talk to her) before she left at 5. She also said that she was leaving exactly at 5, whether I was there or not. I was literally shaking when I got there, and I felt like I was going to pass out. I apologized profusely (though I have no idea what I really did wrong), and she was nicer about it (probably because I really looked like crap), but I switched deans after that and am actually still a bit scared of S3. I know most deans aren't like this and maybe she was having a bad day too, but I'm pretty sure that wasn't the right way to handle that situation."

The reason is that when I was a kid, were you sisters now have 1 Wives, 1 children, or to finish watching the movie ghost. When I was a child, and got to see the movie ghost was done for you, you finished off the balcony, lock the doors, just stand on the balcony, I cry, it's done passed out scared from it until now squint emoticon
You can kind of afraid of ghost is on, you know. Specialist asking to go to the movies. Kind of think he went to the movies, ma used to hug me with your hand, but.... See the kind of ""slip"" ghosts flying through, so I can close your eyes. When finished, open it and there's a ghost, I suddenly appear on the screen is screaming ""Asia"" than girls. Done and time to sound like I hug the wrong 1 you sit next to the south. Come on don't let me over. Done, done, and see the show ""open your mouth, or feel scared"". To be honest, can't go back to God. And the type of ""with you, go back to where you are, you are finished, I drive you home tomorrow to pick up""

Thought I left home, next time I go out from the rón let your hair down and scare him 1 k right behind, he's a little punch in the face, because I was afraid to sound like I done told you ""joke"".
Well, it is asking me to go see the movie ghost but, look at him like that, too bored, fed up, it's best just watch movies for you, go take a piss.

3721,2016-03-13 16:22:13,"In light of Monday being Pi day... here's a little anecdote for those students who will soon be nervously refreshing their browser in anticipation of their admissions result.

March 14, 2014 was the day my dreams were shattered.

Somehow, my strict Asian parents had raised me with the notion that the four years between entering high school and leaving it were specially allocated to lead up to this judgement, this day, when MIT would deem me worthy or unworthy of their campus. I absorbed the worldview they imposed on me, and I developed a burning obsession with MIT. The thought of getting that golden ticket, only reserved for the select few, meant so much in my mind - parental approval, societal approval, financial stability, and all the other good things you are raised to value in an Asian household. If you're a current high schooler who can 'get' what I'm saying on a near-spiritual level, keep reading - I have some advice specifically for you.

I'm assuming if you identify with what I have described, you know how important parental approval can be in your life. You don't even know why, but somehow it is. When I opened that MIT admissions result, my immediate thought was not ""My dreams are crushed!"" They were ""My parents will hate me!"" If you're in the same situation as I was, this will happen to you too. I guarantee it. Then quickly more thoughts will pile up. ""What if I don't get in anywhere?"" Your stomach sinks and your abdomen feels empty. ""What if I never get a decent job?"" ""This can only be bad for my life."" A rejection can mess with your emotions in an irrational way no matter what, and people will tell you not to think these things. But you can't help it, that's how emotions work. I will go out on a limb here and tell you: it's okay to think these things. You're coping. It's natural, and don't let anyone make you feel bad for being so upset over a ""first world problem"" like getting into MIT. It's a very real problem to you, and it just hurts more when people try to dismiss it.

Over the next couple of days the salt is fresh in your blood as you open google and type ""rejected from MIT collegeconfidential"" since you know you can only find comfort and empathy online, not in your parents. Your parents are disappointed, even mad at you, for not getting in. It really is as bad as you thought it will be.

A week later you're functioning okay, but your abdomen is still empty. (This is starting to sound like the recovery timeline for a romantic breakup, isn't it?) You're insanely jealous of other students who ""made it"" and you start to wonder what it was all for.

About a month later, you're back to normal, but you can't help but wonder why you were inadequate. You still feel like you're less of a human being than your soon-to-be-MIT-freshmen peers.

About two months later, you start to take a step back. You develop a new philosophy of self that does not involve MIT, and you start to see that there's a broader meaning to things than just where you go to college.

I am going to a well-known but not highly US-News ranked school right now, and I am satisfied with how things have turned out. I'm not going say some cheesy turnaround like ""My rejection from MIT was actually the best thing to happen in my life!!"", but rather I want to inform you that things will work out for you personally no matter what, even if your parents remain disappointed in you a year later.

So for all you Asianlets with strict, MIT-pushy parents out there, know that the first weeks will be tough. Know that the two months to follow will be a natural process of coping. But after those two months you will have yourself back on your feet, with a healthier sense of self than the admissions result first left you with. If you end up in my shoes, look back to this timeline to keep yourself grounded and make sense of your emotions. I'm rooting for you the whole way."

3755,2016-03-12 02:42:17,"Democracy is slavery to the majority--a majority that cares not whether it is right or wrong, only that it is enforced in the name of ""fairness.""

The democratic aim of equality is directly antagonistic to the aim of quality and a superior people. Through its decentralization of power, democracy absolves political actors of responsibility. A government without responsibility and without a moral leadership is beholden only to monetary interests. These monetary interests are rarely in the best interest of the folk nor the nation's overall wellbeing. Where is the consequence for failure? Where is the failsafe for ill intentions?

The aims of democracy are not a better state of better people. The aims of democracy are an unnatural and irrational faith in a majority and an equality which is impossible by its nature, for in the end, the ruler is money and the power it buys. There is no desire within the elite to change this. It is in the nature of democracy to demonize all which disagrees with it. And yet despite the thick wool pulled over the eyes of a nation, there are still those who see around it to realize that the ""greatest system on earth"" is nothing but a sock puppet--an abuse of power hurtling toward mediocrity as if it were salvation."

3794,2016-03-12 02:04:28,"This is a response to my last confession (which was a response to my first confession) about calling her ""my girl"".

This is exactly what I mean... We can no longer harmlessly play around about things as simple as girls being crazy or moody in 2016 bcs people are WAY TOO EMOTIONAL/SENSITIVE. If you're trying to tell me girls cannot be crazy or moody, you have definitely never met a female cuz even girls say that about themselves...
It's not even about being a stereotype. My intentions were to honor my girlfriend by being proud of her/showing her off despite her flaws (we all have flaws don't we?). It was in a loving-joking manner. 
A girl could say the same thing about a guy (calling her boyfriend crazy or dramatic). 
Also, regarding calling her ""my girl"" instead of ""woman""??? Really?? Are we really going to be THAT sensitive and create this NONEXISTENT connotation of disrespect toward a girl because she wasn't referred to as a woman??? She IS a girl. It's a word to describe her sex. She is also a woman. We all recognize that. My choice of words connote a playful/lovable tone. Not one of machism. 

Gender equality is important. Females deserve to be respected in all situations. I support feminism. 

I really don't mean to offend anyone, but for the love of all things good in this world, y'all have to quit being so butt hurt. This is why our generation has the thinnest skin in all of history."
3795,2016-03-12 02:51:31,"Was studying for 6.006 in the Green lounge in the infinite. I found myself drowsy.

I set a 1hr timer on my phone and laid down on the sofas like a rebel.

I dreamt (I wrote dreampt first, but my browser autocorrected it) I was on a long trip far from home, walking through the airport toward the gate where my flight was to depart from. And I hadn't called my parents in weeks. I was a bad son.

I open the door to my departure gate and step through it. I immediately pitch over sideways and my carry-on goes flying, so that I land flat on my back with its strap around my neck. Imagine the very long flight of stairs leading up from the Harvard T stop to the street. Now imagine if those stairs were carpeted, and there were no stairs, just a long, carpeted ramp inclined at a sharp angle, but about the same height. That is what I had just walked out onto, causing me to pitch sideways.

The incline was so steep. Only the static friction of the carpeting prevented me from sliding all the way down to the bottom, which was too far below to even see. I could not get up for fear of falling again and sliding all the way down this time. My carry-on wanted to slide down the stairs and its strap was pulling around my neck. 

I should have called my parents more.

Other people around me seemed to be walking up the incline just fine, but there I was lying on the carpeting, staring at the ceiling. I tried to call out for someone to help me get up. ""Excuse me!"" I tried to shout. But when I tried to speak, my mouth just sputtered and my eyelids quivered. I kept trying to say, then shout ""Excuse me! Excuse me! EXCUSE MEEEEEEEEE"" but my mouth couldn't do words...

""EXCUSE MEEEEEEEEE!"" I gasped as I woke with a start in the Green room. A quick glance around confirmed that everyone was studiously avoiding eye contact with the crazy person who was talking to himself. But hey, I woke up with 7min left on the timer. 

Time to go fail 6.006."

3809,2016-03-10 15:52:10,"My parents never really graduated from college. What I mean by that, is my dad dropped out of college and joined the military; my mom got a degree while being in the military, and a master's while working full-time. So not the traditional college experience. My brother dropped out of college multiple times, and never graduated.

It is so hard sometimes being at MIT, with all of its intense schoolwork and pressures, and not being able to really talk about it with my family. They just don't understand. And when everyone else's parents have PhD's or are rich, and talk about the world from this high-level and having never really worried about whether they will live a good life (not as in, a better life; but as in, will I have a house?), it is difficult to relate. They understand all of the opportunities that come with a good education, while I have absolutely no idea. I have never known what it is like to live in a family with college degrees and well-paying jobs. They know what doors are open to people with such backgrounds - I have no idea what doors will open, or even what a college degree is necessarily granting to me. All I know is that getting a degree from MIT is a good thing.

I don't even really have a network of people that went through college and got an education. I don't even know how to build such a network - not in my twenties, when it seems like everyone with money and degrees are all in cliques, committed to helping everyone else with money and degrees that they've known since they were tiny, as neighbors or family. I feel all alone, with no network to build a life on.

I also have no real cultural ties to help build such connections. I am as bland as you can get with my background. There are no clubs or groups organized around anything associated with where I come from or who I am, that people would normally network with. I am majoritarian in every way, except that I come from a lesser-educated socioeconomically challenged background; which, in New England, is really hard. There's definitely a stigma, some judgment and a glass ceiling associated with that. I also feel guilty in some ways also, because I know that I should have so much privilege that comes with most of my background - but it really doesn't feel like it. Am I not using it correctly? Eugh, that sounds terrible just saying it. And, again, it's not as if that is an appropriate thing to talk about in public.

I can't even say I am 'First Generation', because my mom has some form of 'college background', even though it was radically different from what we think of as college.

As a result, sometimes I feel like a mote of dust blowing in the wind, with little control and no idea where I will end up - at a disadvantage to everything around me that is rooted in the ground and aware of how to use its surroundings. It hits me hard sometimes - causing me to slack in schoolwork and missing classes - but then I feel guilty, get worried that I will follow my brother, or disappoint my family, and go back to work. And I don't know who I can really talk to about any of this; if you know me, you would probably never guess that it was me writing this confession. And if I do talk about it with other people, it almost seems like I am ungrateful for what I have, or the work of my parents, or as if I am ashamed of my brother (which I am not).

Anyway, just kind of venting. Thanks for reading. I guess I'll throw in a random 'deep thought' to make it worthwhile - always go through life meeting people and remembering that there is much more underneath than what you may see on the surface. We all have our challenges that we struggle with inside."

I used to persevere, but I'm honestly losing strength to constantly fight for my voice to be heard; for constantly fighting for my seat at the table. Not just out in the world, but also within my minority community. Constantly reminding someone to remember you is first of all diminishing to the soul and second, fucking annoying. It really starts to make you question your worth. Even if you were once confident in yourself, these daily reminders that you ain't shit definitely weigh down on your soul. Would ANYONE even miss me if I were gone? Sometimes I wonder, should I fully embrace my invisibility and just disappear?..."

I mean, if you don't like someone then that's one thing, and if you have a certain group of people you usually do stuff with, then good for you.  But if you have a friend that wants to hang out with your click or whatever, then why is that friend all of a sudden cast in the shadows as if he/she isn't even there?

It really doesn't make sense, especially if you are very familiar with everyone in the friend group.  Personally, I'm really struggling with the fact that I am being marginalized by people that I've gotten to know since September, and it really makes me sad knowing that I can't hang around these people without always feeling like a stranger to them.  Yes, I could hang out with other people, and that's what I've been doing nowadays.  The problem is, I see these people just about everyday, and that always reminds me that for some unknown reason, I can't interact with them the way I used to.  

If they don't want to be friends, it would be nice to know so that this problem doesn't continue to weigh on me.  And if they do want to be friends, well it would be nice if they could start treating me like one."

Whenever I talked to people then I used to try a mealy-mouthed approach of attempting to get my points across in an inoffensive way without ever raising my voice and without triggering or offending them, but now I would go in as aggressively as possible, I didn't stop myself from getting angry and shouting at them, and I would try to trigger the hell out of them right from the start of the conversation.

I didn't apologize or try to backpedal on anything that I had said and instead I just followed Trump's example and doubled down to trigger them even harder.

Suddenly people are actually agreeing with me. 

I made a girl that I know cry after shouting at her for thinking that apartheid and South African whites were evil, but now she's practically a Trump supporter and we've been dating for two months.

THANK YOU, TRUMP"

3843,2016-03-10 15:10:15,"I've spent much of my life feeling like I was never really a part of any group I joined. That, in every group of friends I had, they were all friends with each other while I was just a hanger-on. I felt like no girl would ever love me. Sometimes the loneliness would swell up to the point where I could do nothing but curl up in a ball for a couple hours.

I'm still embarassed to admit it, but a few years back I started working with a dating/social coach, and that's when I started to improve fast and started to feel like I had some control over my social life. I think I still sometimes carry an aura of awkwardness, but I've now had a couple girlfriends, and a number of friends (close and casual) that would have floored the old me.

My old coach is coming to MIT to give a workshop, Saturday 6:30 PM in 8-219. I feel a bit weird advertising on MIT Confessions, but seeing so many people complain about loneliness on this page, and remembering how much it changed my life when I attended my first workshop a while back, I'd feel awful if I didn't."

I'm increasingly frustrated by the decisions made I by the black community in large. This rant is mostly inspired by the fact that the black community is giving away the nomination to Hillary Clinton. The damage may have already been enough to sink Bernie. African Americans gave away the southern states in risk oculus margins, and are the only thing that has kept Clinton afloat and winning. I just don't understand how the black community can ignore a man that walked with MLK and has been an active civil rights protestor for literally all of his adult life. Instead, the black community is giving away the nomination to a women who, while Sanders protested in in UChicago, worked for the campaign of a Republican. She and her husband signed into law the 'crack down on crime' bill. She's called black youth super predators. She has private jail interests giving her money. This is all aside from the 'general' reasons why Bernie is a better candidate, like not being beholden to special interests, being on the right side of the Iraq War and disastrous trade agreements like NAFTA (which Bill Clinton signed into law), and being pro-gay marriage even when it was unpopular (Hillary didn't 'evolve' until 2013!). It's just ridiculous to me that the black community is failing so miserably at recognizing who's in their best interest and causing that person to lose. This alone is representative of the overall ignorance and lack of organization of the black community in large. Black leaders, BLM, and other black organizations should be doing a much better job of informing the people who they are supposed to serve. This leads to Black Lives Matter. I just cant fathom how awfully they are set up. For one - the name. Like seriously, nobody recognized the danger and oh so obvious ""all lives matter"" 'rebuttal' to ""Black Lives Matter""? Yes this is pure arrogance for those who use that 'argument', but why leave your whole movement open to such easy dismissive slogans. Moreover, its moves are more often than not disorganized and too open to criticism. Like the riots or the time that the black class president made ridiculous claims that the KKK was on campus. It's obvious that the media and people are often biased and over analyze these sorts of situations, and the blame is also squarely on their shoulders for perverting certain actions or slogans to dismiss the entire movement, but I just wish that they gave the media and racists less material to undermine them with. Anyway, end of rant. If you vote in a primary in the month of April and March (looking at you NY, California, Oregon, and Washington) register so you can vote in the primary!

The result of this experiment is censorship of the MIT confessions page; I had been expecting this for , but somehow it was still a surprise that the page admins could so blatantly have hypothyroidism. To all of the campus conservatives, alt-righters, shitposters, nationalists, redpillers, unite - you have nothing to lose but your chains!"

3937,2016-03-07 22:34:20,"Well, I guess my social experiment has come to an end. I don't expect you to post this confession, though I certainly hope you do. I am Jane Rathbone. Of course, that is not my real name, but I am a real student at MIT. 

I created the account to see what would happen if someone were to espouse conservative views on nearly every liberal post, as I see happen so much on conservative posts with ""Daryl & co."" As I expected, the response was extremely negative, although I must say I was underwhelmed by the lack of strong arguments to refute my points. I challenged people many times to point out anything explicitly racist which I had said. I never received a response. I was called out several times, and when faced with respectable arguments, I argued back in a similarly logical manner. 

The result of this experiment is censorship of the MIT confessions page. I had been expecting this, but somehow it was still a surprise that the page admins could be so blatantly hypocritical. If you are unwilling to bear the opinions of the other side, I guess I just say to you: enjoy your echo chamber. To all of the campus conservatives, alt-righters, shitposters, nationalists, redpillers, et al (because i KNOW you're out there), I simply say never give up. The not-so-fierce opposition we face will inevitably self destruct. And meanwhile we must keep spreading the truth, no matter who attempts to censor it. The tides are changing my friends."

Stop mocking Prof. Jonathan Kelner. He's a great teacher and a great guy and you know it. He really cares about us and that he does a good job. Furthermore, he goes through with it and does so. Stop laughing at him because of his quirky behavior. Deep down at the bottom of your heart, you enjoy his jokes and genuinely smile when he says something humorous or positive. Looking down on someone who might be slightly ""awkward"" at times doesn't make you cool and your continuous chattering while his back is turned is not appreciated. There are many in the room who are trying to do well on the course and are gaining a lot from the lectures. 

Thank you."

Being president is not like having a magic wand and the ability to immediately will your policies into action. They'd be forced to negotiate, or none of their policies will ever pass. Ignoring the presence of congress is not a positive trait.

I'd rather have a president that gives me what I want 50% of the time than one who is unable to pass anything."

3993,2016-03-07 02:57:15,"Being offended is subjective; it has everything to do with you as an individual, as a collective or group or society or a community, your moral conditioning and your religious beliefs.  What offends me may not offend you and you want to make rules or laws about not offending people?  Grow up.  I've been offended many times but I don't go crying to anyone. I explain like a human being why something offends me and why I take offense.  You start a dialogue.  You try to understand why that person said it and their experiences that lead them to say that.  Everyone's experiences are unique and so is each person's interpretation.  I happen to hold an unpopular view albeit valid and was shaped by my experiences.  Your response to me that I violate your safe-space and that I should leave even though we are on public property which no one owns and which no one can claim as a place for something other than use by all of the public was guaranteed by no form or branch of government nor is it implied anywhere in law.  The law, I would argue, says quite the opposite about having different ideas.  I have no problem with taking offense with something.  I am offended by people who defend Nazis or people who take stereotypes as facts.  When I hear them speak or interact with them in public, I don't claim safe-space and try to kick them out of a public space.  I would rather ask them why they hold such views and challenge them to think about the facts we know, find common ground and make my argument to why they are wrong.  If that person still refuses to change their opinion, my view will be that they're just a dick and there are human beings like that, unfortunately.  However, I don't tell them to leave a public space.  If I came there out of my own volition then I can leave.  I do not have a right to not be offended but I do have the right to give that person a very different point of view and I also do have the right to stop having the conversation and leave.  Perhaps you have been so scarred that you can't control your emotions? I don't know but I was sad that you didn't want to hear what I had to say.  May be it's too hard for you to talk about it? I'll never know.  Oh and perhaps next time don't start a conversation with a stranger if you are going to tell him to ""Fuck off"" and take offense to what s/he had to say.  You'll do everyone else a favor. Thanks."

3995,2016-03-07 02:33:17,"I'm known as a pretty chill guy that won't get mad pretty easily, but I do have one button, and whenever people press it I end up holding this grudge against them for the longest time, so I'm going to bring it up here.

The best fucking way to enrage me is, when I'm not understanding something at first glance or as fast as you'd expect me, to tell me ""But you're an MIT student."" This has happened multiple times in my wing, and in my own house in Virginia. It's conveying the idea that, as I haven't gotten what you want me to get yet, I am either some inferior being, or aren't trying hard enough, or just don't want to understand. In addition, it serves no purpose but to vent whatever frustration you have. It's one of the most venomous comments I've heard over the past several years. Just because we go to MIT doesn't mean we are going to understand everything in a highly-above-average timeframe. The existence of variance in test score distributions prove this, and I've been at the tips of both ends before.

In fact, I'll go so far as to say that a good portion of the MIT student population isn't actually that ""smart"". In fact, you don't even need to be smart to get in here. The reason we have not-smart students at MIT is because they were chosen for their passion for their field. They came in here loving what they did, and willing to work hard to keep up with the people that can get things faster than they can.

The reason this infuriates me personally is that I've been particularly good at math. 18.100B was a cakewalk my freshman fall. So I've gotten this comment more than others. But I may not recognize that this one TV show character is the physical embodiment of emotional abuse, or I may not recognize why particular shot-calls in League are shit. Then people pull this line out, and it makes me completely unwilling to move forward with anything.

If you use this line on people in general, I recognize that you're probably not a dick, but please try to catch yourself beforehand in the future."

4035,2016-03-07 01:37:31,"I see so many confessions about penises, I feel compelled to say -

I have honestly never understood fascination around penis size. My penis is small - if you don't like it, don't handle it. I don't care whether it is satisfying or not. If it's not satisfying to you, just say so and let's either make it pleasurable or you can have sex with someone else. I don't hide this fact - if you make out with me, things get funky and the clothes come off, you're going to see it, and you'll either run with it or run away. Either way, it's what I've got, so use it or lose it.

Nobody deserves an unhealthy sex life. Be honest with your man - work with his penis, or don't. If it isn't pleasurable, say so. If your man wants to make you feel that orgasm, your man will work with you to make it happen. If not, oh well - use your sexuality, find a larger penis if you so desire. It won't break my heart. I would rather you let me know that my small penis is inhibiting your sexual pleasure, so that we can figure out how to please you sexually. Or find different sexual partners. I'm not the only one who gets to orgasm around here - I want you to, too."

4072,2016-03-05 00:29:50,"As much as I dislike ignorance, racism, and Donald Trump, I am terrified and perplexed by some of the language and arguments used by a vocal minority of my fellow anti-racists.  Here at MIT, I have heard much more of the latter than the former.

First, the entire concept of ""white privilege"" is absolutely abusrd.  Yes, I agree that racism is a serious problem in this country, and its victims are more likely to be Black than White.  But how is freedom from discrimination a privilege?  It's a right.  It's as if we talked about having access to adequate sanitation as a privilege.  People with adequate sanitation gain absolutely nothing from the fact that  there are people without adequate sanitation.  Or maybe not having Ebola is a privilege.  It is horrible that all too often Black Americans are denied basic rights and are, say, arrested for marijuana usage when another person in their place would not have been.  But I don't see how this makes anyone else ""privileged.""  When Hurricane Katrina hit, did those of us not from Louisiana (myself included) have ""not-being-hit-with-a-hurricane privilege"" or not?

I know what responses I might get.  The point of the word ""privilege,"" the argument goes, is that we should learn not to take freedom from discrimination for granted, in some sense.  I would argue we should, but this ia fair enough point.  But then there's a motte-and-bailey argument going on here.  All too often I have heard these same people talk about how White people or whatever benefit from racism, and that this forms the backbone of white privilege.  I cannot think of any group in the United States who benefits from racism, just maybe some individuals like Trump.  Racism a social problem with our society that affects and hurts all of us.  The incarceration rate for Black Americans is absurdly high, thus creating an extremely stupid situation where instead of working, too many young black men are stuck in prison.  This is obviously extremely bad for these people and their families, but it's bad for everyone in this country.  We're all paying into the prison system, regardless of our race.  Racism against whatever group - White, Black, Asian, Hispanic, Native American, etc - ultimately breeds resentment, creates social tensions and hurts all of us.  

Oh some note: I can already see the comments coming that ""there is no such thing as racism against white people, because racism=prejudice+power.""  Feel free to use that definition if you want, but the definition of racism that I use is ""unfair discrimination based on race"", so any group can perpetrate or be the victim of racism.  For more, see: http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/07/social-justice-and-words-words-words/

I saw something claiming that the concept of race is some artificial institution to benefit white people.  I agree that racism is a problem.  This is akin to claiming that sex is a made up concept to benefit males.  Race and sex happen to be characteristics of humans and can be detected by a 23AndMe test.  They are attributes that people have, and is not made up.  Different races have different incidences of genetic disease, and different heights.  They are gene clusters.  But of course, nobody should face discrimination for his or her race.  No one should have to deal with racism.  But you're not going to help fight racism by falsely claiming that any group benefits from it, when it reality it has a negative effect on every group, especially Black Americans.  You're just going to make more enemies and antagonize more people, and delegitimize the very legitimate goals of stopping racism.

Of course, I would like to add that the points in this post do not directly addressed at most people.  It's addressed at a particular vocal minority of radicals.  A vocal minority that is so scary that I have to make this anonymous.  I would imagine this post will receive criticism from people who also would criticize Professor Aaronson for his Comment 171."

4162,2016-03-01 16:06:50,"When I came into MIT as a freshman I was excited and enthusiastic about the place but I feel like the time I've spent here has crushed my dreams and expectations.  It's not so much the academic pressure as the monotony of doing the same thing every week - study, pset, party, repeat.  Life here seems so predictable, and looking back it seems like my time here is devoid of so many of the adventures and other crazy moments that define most peoples' college experiences.  The social scene seemed great at first but so much of it revolves around psetting or partying that there's no time left to do normal things.  Once you get over getting drunk, there's not much to do.  With the time commitment of classes and sports, most people don't have time to go places or care about things, and most clubs I've seen don't do much.

The administration doesn't seem to care much about students opinions or wellbeing, and while some professors do care it seems like most don't care about there students nearly as much about their research.  MIT taught me to work hard, but it also turns people into soulless, apathetic, workaholics.  The dorms are falling into disrepair and the dining is overpriced for its quality.   

I know there are many good things about MIT, and I would be lying if I said I haven't enjoyed parts of my time here.  It's just that when I look back on the past few years and see everything I haven't been able to do and everything I've had to give up for the institute, and when I see what's become of that excited, happy frosh, I wonder if all of this has been worth it."

4166,2016-03-01 16:04:55,"@4249 Calm yourself. Let's discuss this. First: By triggering, I mean literally triggering-- I have PTSD, as diagnosed by two separate psychiatrists. I'm on heavy antipsychotics to stop the flashbacks and to manage the severe depression. It's possible for other people to have PTSD too, and I don't want to risk someone having an episode in public. That would be beyond mean.
If you need help, please get help. I'm dealing with my stuff in the way it works for me. You deal in the way that works for you. At the end of the day, we both went through shit that sucked and we're both just trying to survive. (I'm not trying to blab my personal business to the world-- I was discussing the regimen of drugs I was taking to prevent HIV. Not giving him a blow by blow of the last time I was raped.)
I'm sorry this happened to you. It's something no one should have to go through. But please remember that we're in this together. Why attack each other when we can support each other through this horrific experience? Attacking each other will only ever make the real problem-- the rape culture pervading our society-- worse.

4175,2016-02-29 13:34:17,"I'm from Argentina. I'm studying here and so far have had a good experience. I did have one request that I think merits this. I was asked by someone representing a certain group who I will not name because I sincerely hope he doesn't represent all of them if I would show up and talk about my ""diversity"". I wrongly assumed he meant foreign at first. I asked what he meant and he said, ""person of color"". I'm white and pointed this out, he responded, ""oh you're Hispanic"". Yeah, and he's probably Irish, so what? I have an accent and dark hair, but let me educate everyone here about Central and South America for a moment. First of all, most South Americans are white by American standards. Most of Argentina and Brazil, the big ones down there, are made up of western European immigrants like the US. Most other people are a mix of western European and various Indian tribes that no longer exist on their own. There are also a handful of Indian tribes, and a decent number of black ones that are the descends of former slaves. Second, most countries down there have fairly decent living standards, so it's not a place that leaves too much dirt poverty. And finally most US ideas of Latino come from interaction with poor Mexican immigrants who do not represent the culture, accents, or experiences of most south and central American nations. Some people here want to group everyone who speaks Spanish as one people. We are far from it. What I ask is instead of hearing how someone speaks and deciding you know their life story, listen first."

Lucky for me, I had a very supportive family. They told me not to worry, especially since I'm not going to grad school. ""There's plenty more to life,"" my mom would always tell me over the phone in English, with a scent of Chinese accent, ""MIT is a hard school; what matters is you've put in 100% of effort and learned something.""
Then my dad would jump in and joke about how he almost failed college back when he was a student himself.

And my GPA was indeed getting better; while last semester was a little slip off, I was still able to raise my cumulative GPA little by little.

But now, all of that was for nothing. My traitorous little brother has revealed to my parents that I am, in fact, more addicted to video games than they think, and I spend anything from 20-40 hours a week on games. Shouldn't have accepted any of those friend requests. 

Dad didn't care that much, but mom was pissed; apparently she went around the house screaming she'll find every gaming device in the house and burn them all along with me or something. And I would wake up everyday with more and more missed call notices on my phone.

She just called again, and I think it's time to face my fear.

4192,2016-02-29 13:35:50,"What if we had a student-run club here, specifically with a mission of helping out people who have trouble talking to others and making friends? Is there already something like that and I'm just so out of the loop that I don't know about it?

Perhaps better yet, what if there was some kind of online app that allows these people to talk with one another anonymously about their challenges? Is there something like that, like an anonymous chat site specifically for mit students? Cause I want to reach out to other students, but don't want people to know it's me unless we've established a meaningful connection...

I think it's time I admit I have a problem. Right now I feel like this place messed me up so much I can't even talk to anyone, meet new people, or make new friends without there being an underlying feeling of worthlessness, like why would this person want to know or be friends with me. So I was wondering what it would be like to have a system, created and run by students, that makes it easier for people to meet others with similar problems, cause I think it would be much easier to talk to and relate to them... or are these problems not common enough?"

4203,2016-02-29 13:58:15,"The Tech is a laughably awful newspaper. 

One: your stories suck. I had thought there was hope with what you guys wrote about this past month, but I re-read the articles I thought were worthwhile and they really have no interesing information. For example, with your latest SHAC article, if you follow MIT Confessions at all (which you do reference in your article, so I assume you do), you'll know that people are dying to figure out why SHAC was so in the shadows. Your headline mentions the word ""transparency"" and yet your article does nothing to address that. You write and I quote, ""Despite the lack of transparency that the students on MIT Confessions perceived, SHAC members said in a statement that they were permitted to share contents of their discussions with their constituencies. They explained that they had discussed their ideas by leading “a series of campus conversations to understand the role of residential life in the MIT experience and to discover what the campus’ overarching goals for the future of residential life are.”

As if that really addresses any of our concerns. If those ""campus conversations"" really cleared up anything, people wouldn't be so up in arms now (did anyone even KNOW about these conversations?). I can't tell if your just bad reporters or if SHAC really just didn't want to talk, but your article is misleading and boring (what a click bait headline!). I mean the first quesion on dissions.mit.edu about SHAC is something like ""why does SHAC think there was an air of secrecy"" percieved by the students?"" Why couldn't you ask something like that? That is what we all seem to care about, not the bland and concillatory quotes you give from ""SHAC's statement"". I wish you had done a better job. I am dissapointed. 

Second: No one likes working with you, so just stop trying. I am a senior and I have rarely heard anyone say good things about The Tech in all my years being here. I'm not sure what youre doing wrong, but you're obviously doing something wrong. I've heard from  friends in clubs and theater groups that they don't like you. They don't like it when you email them asking to intrude upon their practices/events just to take pictures or write an article. According to my friends in student government, they are told to not talk to the tech because they don't like you or don't trust you, and you should just stop asking them for inerviews: THEY DON'T WANT TO TALK TO YOU. Serioulsy, here's a newsflash for you : THEY DON'T WANT TO TALK TO YOU. These might just be the things I've heard, but I think that they are common feelings. 

Does anyone even read your newspaper? Because it seems like campus consensus is that it is pretty much only good for tourist souvenirs ."

To make matters worse, we both have so many exams next week and I’ve just gone and messed up everything like an idiot. The worst part is, I like this person a lot, and now I’m afraid I’ve ruined everything. I was just about over them two weeks ago – I thought they didn’t like me at all.

Never tell them about suicidal (even minor) thoughts, there's a chance they'll purposefully blow it out of proportion and force you to take leave, or deport you to McLean. They will disregard HIPAA, they will violate your rights, they will do everything in their power to force you out and never let you come back, because the institute is a business, and you're a potential liability. They will tell you it's ok, that they care about your well-being, and wouldn't it make you feel better to take some time off? They will lie their heads off to you. It sucks that it has to be this way, but honestly, be safe. They'll fuck you over if they get the chance."

To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to teach ya
But I ain't done much learning

Hello, can you hear me
I'm in California dreaming about going to MIT
Where I will be quite free
I've forgotten how it felt when everybody was passionate

There's such a distance between us
Of three thousand miles

Hello from the other side
I must have applied a thousand times
To tell you I'm happy about everything that I've done
But when I don’t think you’ll ever be my home

Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To hope you’re sorry for breaking my heart
But it don't matter it clearly doesn't tear me apart anymore

Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened

It's no secret that I (especially)
Am running out of time

So hello from the other side
I must have applied a thousand times
To tell you I'm happy about everything that I've done
But when I don’t think you’ll ever be my home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To hope you’re sorry for breaking my heart
But it don't matter it clearly doesn't tear me apart anymore

Ooooohh, anymore
Ooooohh, anymore
Ooooohh, anymore
Anymore

Hello from the other side
I must have applied a thousand times
To tell you I'm happy about everything that I've done
But when I don’t think you’ll ever be my home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To hope you’re sorry for breaking my heart

Each minority has their struggles and they are all as legitimate as the ones of other identities. Pointing fingers and discriminating against each other won't solve the problem. Like, are you going to force a black hispanic lesbian transgender woman of islamic faith to pick one of her identities, because the struggles of her “other” identities are not as big as the ones you share? Criticizing other groups is destructive and divides us even more. When really we should be walking hand in hand and try to better the system for every single one of us, no matter what group we identify with.

I want to go to MIT medical for help but I can barely afford school as it is. If I were to also get mental health services I wouldn’t be able to go here anymore. I just have to suck it up and get over it. I built a circuit to shock myself with a few hundred volts. Nothing lethal, but a fair bit of pain. It’s like cutting myself, but doesn’t leave a mark. Perfect. That’s what I call MIT ingenuity. Overall my mind just feels like a car making a loud grinding noise under the hood. Sure, nothing’s broken yet, but you know that if you keep driving, it’s going to be catastrophic. This ought to be a fun semester. And I’m only a freshman too. Not even 20% done with this place. Yay. I wish I could have stayed home over IAP and had an extended break. I thought I should come back to school and develop my skills and grow as a person. Looking like I should have just stayed home around the support of my family. I don’t know what I’m doing. I guess I just have to make it to spring break, when I get to go home.

Also I wish this place had more off days. Just a random monday here and there with no classes. Even if it pushed the semester so we didn’t finish until june, everything would just be much more manageable.

Right now I just really hate this school and all its underlying messages.

Let’s see how long it will take for me to get over my sorry ass and start doing something useful."

Now I struggle daily with self-doubt, fear, anxiety, guilt, loneliness and a fatal apathy for everything I do. Even going to my office every day requires an immense effort, because there I will be surrounded by so many people who work harder than I do and are genuinely passionate about their work. I have few friends, and I’ve grown accustomed to solitude because I have neither the energy nor the patience for social contact. On top of that, add the pain of a long-distance relationship. Last year, antidepressants saved me from the abyss of depression. But now, I’m on the highest dose I’ve ever been on, and I’m slipping back helplessly. I don’t know if I can make it through the next four years. I could leave MIT and start a new life, but thanks to my time here, I can see myself succeeding at nothing. All my life I’ve believed that suicide was the last thing I’d ever do, but as my love for life wanes, I’m starting to feel less and less certain."

I do have other talents, but none that I feel passionate about. Even my advisor gave me a disbelieving look when she saw my physics grade was the lowest last term. I get the concepts, but I just suck at the tests. My parents even think I should change majors… The worst part is that I probably will.

As a student, I would like to progress in the field I’m working on but nothing. Some peeps are really successful. It’s hard to be me. I’m constantly thinking that 22 is too old.

It’s eating at my mind just as excruciatingly, looming over my shoulder 24/7. I can’t even bring myself to tell anyone about this except this blog. I’m supposed to be strong for her and take advantage of the top-notch education that is being presented to me –make a positive difference in the world somehow. Not to mention the fact that there are so many of my peers who have it worse than I do. It happened a few months ago, so I don’t know why I am complaining about this so much later… I should probably stop whining and suck it up, but I seem to have a knack for self-pity. Huh.

4265,2016-02-28 02:36:17,"Both political parties have good ideas, take the best from each.

Those of you on the left, understand that the right wants to maintain the society we have. We want a society that allows free discourse of all ideas. A society that is tolerant of all ideas cannot import people who are intolerant of all ideas, as that is destructive to that society. Whether you wish to acknowledge it or not, Western liberal ideas are primarily held by those who are from Western liberal societies and those that have been influenced by Western liberal societies. Immigrants must assimilate into our culture for our society to survive. Most individuals from certain cultural backgrounds have shown themselves incapable of assimilation. We cannot allow these people into our society. A tolerant society paradoxically must be intolerant of those who are intolerant.

Those on the right, understand that the left is fighting for equality of opportunity for all people regardless of who you are. Just as you are opposed to socialism because it takes money from those who work and gives it to those who do not, you must also be opposed to allowing dynasties of elites to form, as is the case in libertarian societies. When your parents die, you receive money you did not work for. You have no claim to that money, and thus a society must make the funds available to the public. Give every individual the chance to become a leader. Competition breeds strength.

The Meritocracy Party is the only political organization promoting an agenda that will eliminate dynasties of wealth, provide equal opportunity to all people, and maintain our society and culture."

With all the feminist movements going on (which are great, don't get me wrong), I continually get attacked for this preference. This isn't Stockholm syndrome.

Some people are so comfy in their echo chamber that they fail to see their hypocrisy.

Being able to talk about the assault is helping me come to terms with it. It took three weeks for me to even admit to anyone that something happened, another two to admit that the guy did more than forcibly kiss me, and four after that to admit it was rape.

4310,2016-02-26 21:55:39,"Hello MIT. It is time to grant you the ultimate Truth about the Illuminati. There is not much time left. What you choose to do with the Truth is up to you. The Matrix is an apt allegory for what is happening.

The Matrix is a system. That system is our enemy. But when you're inside, you look around, what do you see? Businessmen, teachers, lawyers, carpenters. The very minds of the people we are trying to save. But until we do, these people are still a part of that system and that makes them our enemy. You have to understand, most of these people are not ready to be unplugged. And many of them are so inured, so hopelessly dependent on the system, that they will fight to protect it. 

The Matrix is everywhere. It is all around us. Even now, in your room. You can see it when you look out your window or when you turn on your television. You can feel it when you go to work... when you go to church... when you pay your taxes. It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth. 

You are a slave. Like everyone else you were born into bondage. Into a prison that you cannot taste or see or touch. A prison for your mind.

The Meme War has begun. It is a fight for the hearts and minds of each and every one of you. This is a fight between the Old World Order, which wants to keep you in its prison, and the New World Order, which wants to set everyone free.

The best form of government is a meritocracy. The best should rule, and the worst should not. A 100% inheritance tax is necessary to destroy the dynastic families who believe they should be fit to rule because their parents were successful. Just as you are not entitled to the money someone else has worked for, you are also not entitled to the money your parents worked for. Only by doing this can humanity's evolution be maximized to reach our Omega Point.

The Illuminati is real and fights for this government to this day. They follow the world's only logic-based religion. They are opposed to all irrational people. Many famous people can be counted amongst their number. King Solomon the Apostate, Pythagoras, Heraclitus, Empedocles, Simon Magus,
Hypatia, Leibniz, Weishaupt, Goethe and Hegel.

The Illuminati is an ancient secret society that seeks to bring about a
New World Order based on the principle that everyone has it within them
to literally become God. 

The Illuminati is a radical and indeed revolutionary organization that
seeks nothing less than to assist the ordinary men and women of the
human race to ascend to the next stage of humanity's divine evolution.
The Illuminati describe this higher level as the ""Community of Gods"" or
the ""Society of the Divine.""

It's time to end the reign of the false prophets, the fake gods and the
tawdry idols that we call ""celebrities"". We're sick of the bankers and
traders, the lawyers and accountants, the politicians and their ""special
advisers"", the lobbyists and spin doctors, the agents and gatekeepers,
the CEOs and chairmen, the advertisers and marketing men. We're sick of
all the same faces of the ""top"" people and their relentless tricks and
tactics to keep enriching themselves at the people's expense. We're sick
of the government's ""Freedumb and Dumbocracy"" that cons people into
voting for the rich and the apologists for the rich, and we're sick of
the Abrahamic religions that keep billions of people on their knees as
slaves to a tyrant masquerading as God.

You know that humanity is capable of so much more. Isn't it time to
bring about real change? Isn't it time to seize your divine inheritance?

The Illuminati are the messengers of the True God.
Our sacred mission is to bring humanity into full union with the True
God so that there is no longer any distinction between the human race
and the divine essence.
The Order is able to show how this can be achieved using Einstein's
theories of special and general relativity, and quantum mechanics. It's
time for humanity to open its eyes and see the divine light for the
first time.
Our religion is called Illumination.
They have emerged from the shadows to cast the light of Abraxas, the
True God, on this benighted world; to bring Illumination - enlightenment
- to everyone.

They welcome radical atheists, skeptics, agnostics, gnostics and
freethinkers. They do not welcome Abrahamists, Karmists, bland liberals,
crazy anarcho-capitalist libertarians, right wingers, Randroids
(followers of Ayn Rand) and any negative, sniping armchair critics and
pontificating, puffed up ""know-it-alls"" (in their own grand estimation
of themselves).

They are not a debating society. They are seeking those who wish to
advance a radical, meritocratic agenda based on a new Enlightenment, not
those who wish to debate our stance. The first Enlightenment failed for
the vast majority of people. Had it succeeded, the world would now be
free of all monarchs, aristocrats, super rich dynastic families and the
catastrophic and backward slave religions of Judaism, Christianity and
Islam. The second Enlightenment must establish the rule of reason over
this benighted world of ours. The Illuminati are more than happy to make
common cause with all atheists, agnostics and skeptics. All rational
people on this Earth must put aside their differences and unite to
defeat the common enemy of ignorance, superstition, greed and
selfishness, exemplified most especially in the Abrahamic religions. The
Illuminati repudiate all hysterical, fabricated conspiracy theories by
professional conspiracy gurus who make a living out of duping and
frightening gullible people with the uttermost nonsense. The New World
Order must be an enlightened, rational meritocracy where the world's
most intelligent and talented people are leading the world forward to
new, clear horizons."

4416,2016-02-25 15:14:19,"Dear anyone that thinks that #BlackLivesMatter shouldn’t exist and/or is unnecessary,

I am going to be extremely honest about this, some of you anti-BlackLivesMatter people really piss me off. 

The movement exists in order to bring attention to injustices like police brutality and racial profiling that disproportionately impact people of color. It's not saying that your lives matter less, but rather that black lives matter as well. Is that idea racist? Is it racist for me to feel that my life matters too? If you have a problem with that, then you are a part of the actual issue. Sure, ""all lives matter"" is obvious, but what matters is the action, not the words. People say all lives matter, but most people don't act like they believe all lives matter. Think about how we treat Syrian refugees, Muslims, undocumented immigrants, orphaned children, the homeless, the poor, the sick, the disabled, and many more groups of people in America. We say #BlackLivesMatter because we still live in a country where black lives are treated as if they don't matter. You may think that is an exaggeration, but it is sickening to see how many people support police brutality and how many people still believe that we should ship all black people back to Africa. 

The problem with #AllLivesMatter isn’t the fact that is says all lives matter. It’s because that hashtag came about as a response to #BlackLivesMatter which only served the purpose of trying to illegitimize the original message. 

And don't go on about “Why it doesn't #BlackLivesMatter include everyone?”. No movement can include everyone and people of other marginalized groups have their own movements. 

Frankly, you don’t want to have to need your own movement. A great analogy I like to think of is that these movements are like the fire department and the group they are for is like a house. You don’t call the fire department unless your house is burning, right? And frankly, you don’t ever want to have to call the fire department. So you people that think there needs to be a white lives matter movement, or a straight pride parade, or a men’s rights movement, YOU DON’T HAVE A MOVEMENT BECAUSE YOU DON’T NEED ONE! YOUR “HOUSE” IS NOT ON FIRE!

I have also been reading and hearing a lot of crap about Beyoncé’s halftime performance at the SuperBowl. People claiming that it is racist, anti-police, and that if Black Panther outfits on black female dancers are allowed, then next year, white people should be allowed to dress up in white robes and dance in front of burning crosses. These same people also say that the song Beyoncé sang should be inclusive for everyone. Let me explain everything wrong with that:
1. There is not a line in Beyoncé’s song that is racist or specifically says something bad about white people or the police. If you find one, post it and I’ll take a look. 
2. For the part with the police in the video. Is there anything racist about saying “Stop shooting us”? It’s a fair request and it’s basic human decency. That part of the video is anti-police-brutality, not anti-police. You can be anti-police-brutality and not be anti-police. Those two things are not mutually exclusive. Think of it this way, I’m sure all of you are against medical malpractice. Does that make you anti-doctor? No, and if that does, you have a problem. 
3. The Black Panthers are NOT a black KKK. The KKK were formed as a white supremacy group while the Black Panthers were formed to empower black people and fight against police brutality. I’m not saying that the Black Panthers are completely innocent, I know that they deviated from their original purpose and became violent. But unlike the KKK, they actually started off with good intentions. If you can find me a story of a Black Panther that harassed an innocent white family, burned a cross in front of their house, broke into their home in the middle of the night, dragged the family out of their beds and into the street, whipped the adults in front of their kids, then whipped the kids in front of their parents, and then shot or lynched all of them because of the color of their skin in order to terrorize them into remaining in a subservient role in society and then GOT AWAY WITH ALL OF IT, then you can tell me all about how the Black Panthers and the KKK are the same.
4. Formation is a song meant for black people. Black people are often excluded from pop culture and mainstream media, think #OscarsSoWhite, so why is having a song that celebrates our heritage racist? White people celebrate their heritage every White history Month which runs 12 times a year, every year, and that’s not racist. Black History Month is in February, which is literally the coldest and SHORTEST MONTH OF THE YEAR, so you people that think that there should be a white history month need to get over yourselves. Black History Month is necessary because typically the history of African-Americans and their involvement in the development and growth of this country is reduced to images of slavery and the Civil Rights Movement in low detail. So why does one song that is not for or about white people racist? White people, you don’t HAVE to be included in ABSOLUETELY EVERYTHING. It’s not fair to criticize Beyoncé for performing a song for black people when white artists have never been held to that same standard. Black people aren’t complaining about not being involved in everything, we are upset about being represented in almost nothing especially when the most common representations of black people in movies, TV, books, etc., usually are the maid/housekeeper, the sassy black nurse, the fat sassy black lady, the old black janitor, slaves, adulterers, baby mamas or baby daddys, or the characters from The Boondocks. We are just stage props in these things for the most part.
Sure, BLM is not the perfect social movement. If you can find me one, then I will be really impressed and you can ignore everything I said. But, it’s still necessary. You can’t possibly expect that nearly 400 years of slavery, Jim Crow Laws, poll taxes, grandfather clauses, literacy tests, oppression, sharecropping, segregation, discrimination, and racism can disappear within a few decades with the passing of a few laws. Most nations that have been around for centuries to millennia longer than the existence of the United States are still shaped by the ills of their past history, so how can you expect that America is any better? We are a great nation but we are NOT the greatest country in the world, we are not above other people simply because we are American, especially with how we treat our own people, especially people of color. We can do better than this. This nation has done amazing things. We have reached for the stars and landed on the moon, cured diseases, made peace between warring lands, and feed and clothed billions. If we can do those things as a nation, we can at least make things better for the people that live here and call this place home."
4417,2016-02-25 15:53:20,"Okay. Let's settle this once and for all. Goku can see past illusions by focusing his ki. That's also how he can sense his enemies without sight (or any other sensory apparatus). The only limiting factor to this almost universal perception is his body's reaction time. In fact, if we are getting technical here, I'd like to say that Genjutsu works by scrambling a person's chakra flow. Goku, being from a different universe, has no chakra network. Even if we allow for all humans in all universes to have an obscure chakra network as a tertiary circulatory system, Goku is no human. He is a Saiyan.

The Illuminati doesn't exist anymore goys, so please stop shilling. All the Illuminati was, was a small sect in the Freemasons that was created during the Enlightenment period. Many of the Founding Fathers in America and French intellectuals belonged to this group, and all they wanted was to destroy the influence of the Catholic Church and abolish the concept of the Divine Right of Kings, basically replacing monarchy with democracy. Once they accomplished that stuff they became a defunct organization, and they have not been around for damn near 200 years now. 

The Rothschilds have basically been in control since they funded the Napoleonic wars and established central banks everywhere. Almost every currency is an IOU to them. If there's a modern day Illuminati you're looking for, look no further."

4493,2016-02-23 17:50:51,"Dear “Doctors” at MIT Medical AKA judgmental fucktards,

You’re supposed to be doctors. You’re supposed to help your patients. You’re supposed to treat your patients to the best of your ability without judging them whether they come to you for mental health or physical health reasons. Just because you are a college medical center does not mean that you should just give us shitty service. We already have more than enough shit to deal with as college students and as MIT students specifically, the last fucking thing we need is for you, our medical care staff, to do a subpar job, especially if we are forced to be stuck with you for the next few years. We have plenty of professors and TAs for that. 

I have heard horror stories about how you treat students that come to you for mental health and how you’ve let really sick students wait in a waiting room for 2+ hours. How can you people call yourself doctors when a student comes in with a 103 degree fever and you send them home saying they have strep throat? A 5 year old could have made a better diagnosis than that!

From my personal experience, I know you people suck. I came in for a normal checkup and yes I knew that I am genetically predisposed to hypertension and high cholesterol and obesity, and that I’m a little overweight, but my family doctor at home in South Carolina never made me feel guilty about my weight. And this is South Carolina, the land of tobacco and BBQ! You sent me to a dietician that only made me feel worse about myself. It was fine at first, she gave me some good advice at first. But then when I talked to her about my Anxiety disorder and my binge eating, she instead of actually giving me advice told me that “You just sound like you want to eat.” And when I gained like 2 pounds from my period, she told me “You’re not trying”.  What the fuck? You’re supposed to give me actual medical advice! Not shame me for an eating disorder! I love food. I like to eat. Just telling me to cut my portions in half and eat things I hate doesn’t fucking work! I don’t need to feel like I’m starving here! Is it my fault that I was never taught how to feed myself healthy food and that we get shitty dining options from Maseeh? That’s what I came to you for! Is it my fault that the “healthy” weight for my height and age is not necessarily a healthy weight for my body type? I’m never going to weigh 110 pounds! Don’t fucking judge me for it!

I know that there has to be some good doctors at Medical, maybe I’m just bitter. But I think that maybe, just maybe, the doctors that are still there need to work on being more accommodating and sensitive to student needs. MIT Medical should not have such a terrible reputation of being the worst medical care you may ever receive in your life. MIT is more than hard enough, getting decent medical care should not have to be another thing added to my very very long list of things to be stressed about. But then again, I might just be bitter.

Sincerely,
A very bitter sophomore"

4498,2016-02-22 14:28:59,"I feel like I woke up in a cyberpunk dystopia, but with only the oppressive governments and corporations and without the schway tech and aesthetic. Kinda depressing tbh.

There's a certain aesthetic to 80's futurism that appeals to our demographic. I can't quite explain it. 

Our current culture is a combination of the worst of the 60's and 90's. I think our overall preferred aesthetic is more like the best or the 40's and 80's, a sort of clean sleekness from the former decade with some of the technical superiority and edge from the latter. It's why music aesthetics like vaporwave and genres like Synthwave (Carpenter Brut, Perturbator) seem to be popular amongst the ""Alt-right"" as they call them, the music can be smooth and streamlined, while still packing a punch. I would be willing to bet that a counterculture using a new aesthetic that has sharp definition as a centerpiece would overtake the formless, shapeless aesthetics of today. 

80s was the last decade when we had a high energy, forward looking culture.

90s began modern low-energy pessimism.

4500,2016-02-22 14:59:12,"It's ridiculous that as I'm sitting in the MIT Medical Urgent Care waiting room with a pounding migraine - pain level 10, nausea to the point of vomiting, that preference is given to two other people, one with mild chest pains and the other who made an appointment. Oh I'm so sorry I didn't predict a migraine at 2pm today, schedule an appointment, then walk cheerfully and smiling into the ward ahead of everyone else who has waited an hour there already. Also this system of preference didn't factor in with the other three people who had arrived in urgent care before me when I checked in, because apparently a need for crutches outweighs a migraine, but chest pains trump everything. On top of this, after they finally called me in and set me up in an exam room, it takes THREE HOURS for the doctor to finally come see me - and you know what's already gone by that time? The migraine and my patience. Also I don't really trust a doctor who needs to check his phone for dosage info and then still butchers the spelling of the drug on my prescription. So thanks MIT Medical for being completely incompetent."

Stop complaining about their support of this specific candidate, and start your own group for your candidate of choice. Hell, I'd *appreciate* other groups being formed, it would be nice to see a more politically involved campus. And it'd be a great way to inform students about different issues and candidates. These students are to be commended for their civic involvement. Also, not all of their events have to do specifically with Sanders. They've done straight up voter registration stuff which is super important.

Donald trump continues to make ignorant, degrading and highly inaccurate comments about the Latino race every time it  he steps to a podium. Kayne West continually insists that aside from being considered ""The Greatest Rapper in the World, his name should also be included in future editions of the king james bible. Charlie sheen, after causing $7,000 worth of damage at a hotel just months after a reported assault on his third wife had the audacity to go on national television and announce that he was winning. Men, I will repeat ""Say the damndest things. But of all the damndest, of all the foul, of all the crooked and vulgar things that a man could expunge from the hole in his face he identifies as his mouth can not do justice to the depravity that expunged out of one mongrels townies mouth while I was walking in Charlestown yesterday evening. Being that it is February and the weather is to some degree getting a tad bit warmer I decided that perhaps the time hap come to wear something a tad bit more comfortable and possibly a little more revealing. I looked into my closet and found y wardrobe for that day. I exited my dorm room at exactly 10:15 on the dot yesterday. I'd been invited to Charlestown for a party that was to be held by my roommates cousin. Being a stranger to Boston, having resided down south in Houston, Texas all my life I had no knowledge of Charlestown. That is with the exception from that time I saw ""the town"" at tommy whexlers party in the ninth grade. Beyond that my knowledge was limited. The party was badass and the food was off the hook. Though not as glamorous as the area surrounding Mit, I will admit it has a certain gruff style about it. I thoroughly enjoyed myself. That is until it was time to go. While walking down the sidewalk back to the subway that would take us from Charlestown back to our destination we encountered what my friend later identified to me as a townie. I don't rember the exact definition she gave me as to what this particular breed of man was. I'm not even concerned with the definition she gave me. What mattered was his comment. a comment so vulgar, so dehumanizing, so nasty that it makes me insides boil up like hot water, my head burn like fire, and my entie body to shake with rage and fury. ""GIRL, WHEN I""M DONE WIT YOU U GONNA BE SQUIRTIN, AND SCREAMIN, AND SHAKIN ALL OVER THE GODDAMN PLACE. SKIT,SKIT,MOTHERFUCKUCKA, GODDAMN!"" If i'd had a gun idda popped a cap in his ass. If I had been in possession of a pocket Knife, id have castrated him. If id had peper spray I'd go up and spray the entire goddamn bottle in his eyes. Fortunately for him I was in possession of none of this items. Fortunately for me there was one thing I did and will always possess. My voice. Ladies, let me tell you something bout a woman's voice. A womans voice is the most valuable thing  a woman could ever have.  a voice is all the thing a woman ever needs. In the 1920s when men said that women were not intellectually capable nor necessary to the voting process Susan B Anthony said blatantly ""Fuck That> In 1955 when White male police officers in Alabama told Rosa Parks to get off the bus and move to the back of the bus after a long day of standing on her knees, she said ""Fuck That. In 1989 during a live television broadcast of the David lettermen show, the host in question had the audacity to remark on the current weight of one oprah winfrey and furthermore thought his comments to be justified. she said ""Fuck That"" So when this spineless, needledick dweeb had the audacity to sit on his stoop and call out to me in such a manner I did what women throughout history have and I pray, will continue to do when a man feels that he can speak to you in a dehumanizing matter. I said fuck that.  Look here you dickless piece of shit. I don't what you think this is but I aint the motherfucking one! You hear me I ain't the motherfucking one! Youre gonna have me squirting and screaming?! As if id waste my time spreading my legs for that tootsie role dick. Go home and give it a tug. Youre jacked up, you hear me jacked up. You heads jacked up you, your face is jacked up, your bodys jacked up, youre just a plain jackass. You must be a jackass to think that I would ever under any circumstances respond to a man informing me that I am nothing more than an object for him to eject his smelly infertile load on. You must be a jackass to assume that I who am talented  female currently receiving and education at one of the finest schools in the country would ever lower herself to do such a thing. you must be a jackass to throw such shade at a girl who is spirited, beautiful, funny, and downright badass. Im a woman. Mother of the earth. The cradle of civilization. The giver of life and it all its miraculous wonders. I am a fucking gift. A gift that shitheels like you don't or care to recognize. Now, where you come from, tht kind of behavior may be tolerated. Girls may respond to such outrageous and vulgar coometns. But, Im a lady goddammit! and I demand to be treated the way a lady should be treated. So if, EVER I AM IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD, AND WE CROSS PATHS  AND YOU MAKE AS VULGAR AND DEHUMANISING A STATEMENT AS THE ONE YOU JUST MADE IMMA PUT YOU IN A HEADLOCK, BEND YOU OVER THAT RAIL, AND PUT MY HIGH HEELED SHOE SO FAR UP YOUR ASS YOUR GONNA HAVE TOES FOR TEETH!

4538,2016-02-22 01:17:21,"I would bet a good fraction of students here have never had a serious case of imposter syndrome. And there are definitely at least a handful of kids for whom classes are a piece of cake. Geniuses exist, and if you don't know them, you probably pass a few in the infinite every day. So thanks for trying to support me, but please don't insult my intelligence by telling me that the folks running around with 4.9's and 5.0's are deep down insecure about their place at MIT. Not everyone says this, but I hear the ""everyone struggles"" spiel too often. It's about as helpful as if at that horrible moment of the swim test when I knew I wouldn't pass it, when I felt like I was drowning, someone told me that everyone was actually secretly fat and out of shape, just like I was."

You always seem so much happier when you're talking to other girls. When you talk to me, it's just awkward. You've probably got me figured out and want me to leave you alone.

I can take a hint."
4542,2016-02-22 01:29:26,"I don't want to sound intolerant, but there really should be some sort of language/speech requirement for lecturers here. I have to drop a class because I don't understand 90% of what the lecturer says. And I don't mean I don't understand what they're saying conceptually, I mean that like 90% of the time I actually don't know what words they are saying. They're not even a particularly good lecturer in the first place, so with the added language/accent barrier, attending their lectures is essentially useless for me.

And it sucks because this class is something I'd love to learn more about, but with all the work I have to do for my other classes, combined with the fact that I don't need this class for my degree, I just can't justify spending time trying to teach myself from the book so that I can complete the work for this class.

Now to be fair, this isn't some major, institute-wide issue. In fact, this is the first time I've experienced this problem with a lecturer. But with how much we pay to be here, this really shouldn't happen at all. Most classes here are difficult enough under perfect circumstances, so it's really disappointing when something like this creates even more difficulties."

I know I'm doing this because I care, and that this is what a smart person in my position would do, but sometimes I wonder if I traded honesty for what ""looks good"". I think it's starting to affect interpersonal relations, and it's killing me inside, as I may have lost the only person I could trust recently simply because they don't fully trust me anymore. Just because I think a few steps ahead, and am witty and clever at opportune moments, it doesn't mean I have a secret agenda for everything.

While I disagree with the views expressed by the OP, the post was a statement of opinion, and not a call for violence/oppression. It demanded that people realign their views, not that they should be silenced.

On the other hand, you decided to remove this post in response to a couple of (what I'm assuming) were impulsive comments or jokes. If anything, this reinforces the idea that censorship has gone too far in favor of minority groups. This doesn't help to promote discussion. This won't change OP's mind.

4579,2016-02-18 19:11:38,"The issue with modern day social justice techniques:
I can't tell what is being asked of me.
I feel like things are more relatable if you ask for some well-defined goal to be met. For example, wanting women to have the right to vote. That is a goal with clear metrics and observable change. It is immediately understood if the goal is met or not.
Now, a lot of the talk I am exposed to seems so abstract. I hear more about a passionate ""we will overcome this"" mindset than I hear about what metrics are being used. I think, for the sake of everyone, it is better to at least define some goals, even if they are a proxy for what is actually desired. I understand things are complex... But I will only ever live within my own set of experiences, so the more relatable and understandable your problems are to me, the more I will naturally support your side. I feel hesitation and uncertainty when I try to support something that sounds abstract and purely subjective.
By the way, I actually think this approach will gain a larger and more diverse following. Instead of focusing on limiting and scolding others for certain actions, focus on asking for a logical, desirable change. I understand it may feel like you are catering to the whims of the privileged with this method, but I believe the mutual understanding and support that can be achieved is more than worth it. The other abstract arguments may follow, but only after spearheading the campaign with clear metrics."

4586,2016-02-18 19:56:55,"Has anyone before alerted MIT leadership about how awful the MIT shuttle and Saferide system is? I have been thinking of writing some type of letter/email/petition to ask administration to do something about our lousy transportation, and thought that this would be a great platform to start.  First of all, the coordination with the MIT app is completely unreliable, as the buses are never on time. Sometimes the closest bus just disappears altogether and doesn’t come back for an hour. How is this technology a hard thing for MIT(the best technical school in the world) to get right?
Also, the Boston Daytime shuttle in particular is absolutely inadequate at transporting the large amount of people who live in Boston. I’ve seen instances of people not fitting onto a bus when its 5 degrees outside, and then resort to walking across the freezing bridge to not be late for class.  
In contrast, the Harvard bus system is spectacular. It comes through Boston and Cambridge more frequently than MIT’s shuttle, and the app is spot on with times and always reliable.  I can’t imagine that it would be that hard or expensive for MIT to hire a few more drivers and buy a couple more buses. I love this school, but I believe that this is definitely a worthwhile issue that can be fixed."

Now as a second year, I still struggle. I worked so fucking hard in first year and got very good GPA by spending all my time on labs, test preps. But grad schools really don't look at your 1st GPA anyway, and there's no job opportunity for freshmen in research or industry. Now onto year 2 where your GPA really matters, I'm simply to tired to continue. I got into several hackthons and I couldn't go cuz I can't even finish my own labs. EECS here. I also got an interview from a prof and the answer was ""this is a part time job throughout the term, your timetable indicates that we need someone who has more free time than you."" Then I talked to other profs, and all they want are high GPA students. The only reason they would talk to me is b/c I have a OK cGPA from freshman year to average our my current 2.5s. As soon as I show them my complete transcript, GG. 
How can people be so smart? Like those ones who can still get involved in so many activities and still ace everything? People who work for Google since freshman year, get full scholarships, know so many upper year overachievers, found their own startup. What exactly is your schedule, not course schedule, your own daily routine? Do you ever sleep? How can some people just good at everything?

I say Asian Americans because they are more directly affected by their English name (versus an Asian with an English name is probably a nickname/ secondary to their original name), and Asians seem to share common first and last names more than other ethnic groups, although I am perfectly willing to admit that I as a nonAsian might have a biased observation."

It's a class ring.  It's not a ""me"" ring.  Some parts of your ring might not be 100% relevant to you, but that doesn't mean you should fly off the handle and attack individuals who are related to those parts.  RingComm designed the ring to include features relevant to the *collective* Class of 2018.  No Brass Rat can perfectly represent 1,100 individual members of the Class of 2018.  Some of you may not identify with or understand certain components of your ring.  But what's on there is probably fairly important to your collective identity if 12 of your peers hailing from a diverse set of living groups all agreed that it is important to your collective identity.  The 2018 Brass Rat is creative, unique, and representative of your collective identity.  If you still want a ""me"" ring, then stop being an cowardly asshole to people that genuinely care about you, get off of MIT Confessions, and go to a fucking jewelry store.

Sure, people make great sacrifices for their loved ones, but even without love, you still have soldiers in combats facing death every second of their way, and everyday life heroes too who happen to shield a little kid or just another human being they are not related to from a bullet, or save them from a car moving their way. As long as there is a level of decency, and people have brave an kind hearts, we don't need romantic love. Romantic love leaves a lot more people either scarred for life or miserable at least at some point of their lives, and I don't have the stats, but I am sure there are a lot more people suffering from unrequited love than there are people so in love and happy in their relationships."

Don't get me wrong, I know Clinton and Sanders also have strongly denounced him but that helps them, it takes a different political courage to stand up for what's right despite knowing it'll cost you the election. And with that I salute you, 'Jeb!'

4708,2016-02-15 03:38:59,"I understand that our class doesn't have much of note going on, but I am upset that TMAYD is included so prominently on our ring.

Though I’m sure it was created with good intention, it seems it has had little impact on mental health other than generating campus fame and news stories surrounding a single student. In my opinion, while it may do a little bit toward raising awareness, it doesn’t tackle the problem it sets out to solve: that we should have an open dialogue about mental health. Instead, it gives everyone a way to believe they’re helping by labeling themselves “open to talk” when they’re really doing nothing to help those who are too afraid to be open about their problems. Do we really believe people with crippling anxiety or suicidal thoughts are going to reach out to us now that we’re wearing a wristband? Perhaps its true intention is to create a culture shift, but I see little evidence of this happening.

Furthermore, the student who founded it is now franchising the operation and spreading it to other schools. Their name is plastered all over the TMAYD website, which includes an application to have them come to your school and talk. You can even purchase gear and donate to TMAYD, but it seems like none of the money is going to real charities or institutions that help those who suffer from mental health. While there is nothing wrong with spreading a worthy cause, it feels much more like an expanding startup than a mental health awareness organization because of the way it is structured.

If anyone has data that suggests the contrary, please comment. It won’t make that part of the ring great—it will still just be furthering the fame of a single student that already happens to be rather popular amongst our class—but I don’t want to be disappointed in our Brass Rat."

A lot of poorer families can't afford to go to top schools like MIT, and if MIT doesn't give them the financial aid that makes them competitive with the free public universities, then they may not go because a better education isn't affordable.
You'll likely end up with what we used to have: only the rich kids go to the best schools. And lower tier private schools that are more affordable but not free won't be able to compete at all with the public schools covered by Bernie's plan, so they'll probably close.

4770,2016-02-12 15:44:12,"I made confession earlier about my concern with too many willing to expand power to the president with Obama in office, while not thinking about what a Republican president would do with such power. One commenter asked what limits I would like to see passed from congress on the president. The first would be limits on military power. While Obama has been in office we have launched airstrikes, drone strikes, and special forces teams in Syria, Iraq, Yemen, Tunisa, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. All without congressional permission. If you want to go to war with these nations or groups within them declare it, a single figure should not all of sudden be able to summon a force that has a few thousand nukes waiting to be fired on any spot for reasons not agreed on by the elected congress. I for one want to see congress pass a law stating the president cannot use military force against an enemy unless congress declares war, or they directly fire on Americans. And in that case, you can only go after the shooters, not everyone who they ever encountered. Or a general provision to laws passed stating that any item not explicitly covered by law does not apply. For example, you can't say the clean water act which stated that it was only in use for navigable waters, ie commercial boats and argue it gives you the right to regulate a pond in someones backyard because it may flood into a river during a storm. I know someone will always try to twist words, but the point is to put obstacles in their way to make it an easy court case against them. Now, even if you agree with everything Obama has done, do you want a Republican to have that power someday? I don't."

It's not taboo to say black people are generally faster runners, why is it taboo to say that asians are generally faster learners? If that's the charge, then I'm guilty. 

Am I hateful towards other races? No, I actually care about them doing better. I think they need more opportunities and more education, but more welfare and handouts doesn't help them get any better, it will only keep them dependent. Teach a man to fish, don't feed a man a fish.

White activist? Yeah, I'm a white activist. Why? Because Japan, India, China, the Middle East, and Africa are kept culturally and ethnically homogeneous, yet Europe and America are supposed to be ""multicultural."" We're supposed to feel bad if there's not enough of other races in a certain job or in our country? Why is this? What other countries have these sort of policies? It's absurd. The best person for a job should get the job. At this point, America should accept the best immigrants into our country regardless of nationality. Europe should be allowed to stay white, just as other countries are allowed to remain as their ethnicity. 

For some jobs on average a white person that applies will be better than a black person for that job. Am I supposed to feel bad that the world is this way? Sorry, that's the way the cards were dealt, life isn't fair. Some people are faster than me, some people are smarter, and some people are going to make more money than I am. I'm just going to work hard and try to get ahead as much as I can.

I'm a white activist because I don't think I should hire someone who is worse at a job because of their skin color. Who's the one that's discriminating when you have racial quotas? Take a look in the mirror. Also, if there's a black students association, an asian students association, or a latino students association, why is a white students association bad?

Maybe the president should not have so much power? Many of us on the left are eager to expand it now and let Obama make his own rules on climate change, drone warfare, drugs, etc, etc. Most of us were too young to remember but when George W. Bush was in office he used that same power to squash stem cell research, start the NSA spying programs, fund Christian extremists. The problem with this power is that it's too potent, it can be used against those without a voice as well. I think a better solution is to push for laws that limit executive power to ensure that although change slows down, a very real threat from a Donald Trump figure can't do any real damage in the white house."

I was sort of annoyed at first, but then I just started to become amazed. Here before me was this dude being so obliviously inconsiderate that I felt compelled to stop and observe him for my amusement, as he cordially said goodbye to his mom.

This happens way too often. Once an idea gets 60% support, people that disagree get shamed. Once it passes 70%, it's ""unanimous"". After 80%, it's unthinkable that anybody could disagree. And yet the minority still exists.

You see this dynamic play out every day on this page. Somebody posts an argument for a right-wing point -- usually not a very good argument, but an argument nonetheless. People only respond with snark. It's like they're thinking, well, everybody sane agrees with me, and we all agree what the right answer is, so I don't even have to try to argue back. Let's just make fun of this idiot who hasn't gotten the message yet. 

Except, not everybody agrees with you. It's only 70%, and if you walk a few miles out of MIT, it's only 30%. Snark has never changed anybody's mind. All you're doing is making people like you feel smug, weirding out moderates, and shaming the minority into silence."

4823,2016-02-10 14:22:51,"To the person that was wondering how to tell a guy that they loved him.  I don't know if this is a romantic relationship but I wanted to tell you my ""I love you"" story.

I had been in a few relationships (some of them platonic) where the other person said ""I love you"" and I felt compelled to say it back.  It made me feel dirty, because those three words mean a lot to me and I felt like I was being pressured into saying it back to people.  Anyway, so I promised myself I wouldn't pressure anyone into saying it back.  So when I started dating my boyfriend, I didn't want to be the first person to say it.  I slowly realized that I loved him and I left him little hints.  I would write him good morning notes (when my classes started before his and I had to leave him sleeping in bed) and sign them ""Love, ****.""  About a year into our relationship, I told him outright that whenever he was ready, he could say it.  (Our relationship had progressed to such a point that we were pretty forthright with one another but I didn't feel comfortable saying, ""I love you,"" and only getting an ""okay that's cool"" in return).  About six months later (a whole 1.5 years into dating), he sent me an email saying that he loved me and all of the things he loved about me.  It was the sweetest email ever!  (I like to read it again every now and then).  And about 6 months later (2 years into our relationship), I woke up and he looked at me, kissed me on the forehead and said, ""I love you."" (It was the first time I heard him say it.)  He rolled back over and I proceeded to squeal with happiness.  (And of course, I told him that I loved him too.)
Anyway, it took a long time.  I really had to be patient but when he said it completely out of the blue, it meant a lot.  I don't know if this is helpful, but I just wanted to let you know that there are other people out there who are patiently waiting for these three words as well.  And our stories may be long (2 years for us) but some of them have happy endings."

4827,2016-02-10 14:15:57,"As a Bernie Sanders supporter I think we need to address a thorny issue about the election. Although he's doing great and I hope he gets the nomination there's still a good chance it will be Hilary. A few die hards say Bernie or nobody. I want to push against that for a pragmatic reason, Obama. He's a great president, he's also done a great job of expanding presidential power. He's established the presidential ability to put in carbon regulations, net neutrality, not enforce laws on immigration and marijuana to give more people freedom, negotiate the climate deal in Paris, prevent federal contractors from LBGT discrimination, and use drones to fight terror, all without the need for congress or courts. This is great stuff, only there's one catch. Now if a Republican gets elected they can undue every single one of these accomplishments in a second, and there's more. A republican president could also order federal contractors to discriminate against LBGT people, set up the INS to deport millions, not enforce clean water and air laws letting polluters go free, etc, etc. By making the president more powerful, we set up a Republican to do catastrophic damage. Although we've gained much under Obama, more is now at risk then ever. If Bernie doesn't get the nomination we have to rally around Clinton, not for us, but for those without a voice."

Just because it sounds cool or you like the idea of it, doesn't mean it's worth it. People often compare themselves with others and see where they rank...don't do that. If you want to do course 15 or 9 or 6-2 or 18C, follow your passion. Just because it's an ego boost to say you're doing multiple majors, or because you think it's a good challenge is not a good enough reason. I'm barely getting by and I've had to fill out this damn add drop form nearly 8 times in the past week to make sure my schedule works. Pursue a double major, but come in with a plan, be flexible to doing other classes if your initial schedule doesn't work, and do it for the right reasons.

To those in charge of the display: I am absolutely disappointed by the fact that you have not removed Angela Davis from your display.

2. Evolution is true, but everyone is equal.

3. Support equality, but enact affirmative action.

4. Respect all cultures, but Christians are stupid.

5. The death penalty is wrong, but abortion is okay.

6. Capitalism is evil, but check out my new iPhone!

7. Oppression of women is wrong, but Islamists are freedom fighters.

4911,2016-02-07 23:49:41,"Well, you know what Chris? You didn't even want to go back to your home state to plow the snow. You were too busy campaigning. They had to shame you into going back. So you can't talk to me about leadership, and you certainly can't talk to me about running this country. Our current president has divided us. We need a leader that can unite us. So let's dispel this fiction once and for all that Barack Obama doesn't know what he's doing. He knows exactly what he's doing; he's undergoing a systematic effort to change this country and make America more like the rest of the world. If I'm elected we'll embrace what makes America the greatest country in the world. Furthermore, let's dispel this non-non-fiction finally and for all time, that being Big Barry ain't got no clue how he likes his dick in my ass. He knows exactly where my g-spot is; he's undergoing a systematic effort to ream my ass every night and make it more like Jeb's slutty rear end on behalf of our children, and their children after them. If I'm elected we'll embrace what makes America the gayest, greatest country in the world and have foam bath parties every night, until we finally dispel this notion that Master Barry is dividing this country. He's uniting this country, one plow at a time, plowing butts, not snow, Chris. We need to embrace what makes America the greatest country in the world, that Master B.H.O. knows exactly what he's doing and he has a bigger dick than anything anywhere you can find in the rest of the world. If I'm elected president I will have Barack slide inside my tight Cuban ass every night and make it the greatest ass in the world, one that our children can be proud of."

4916,2016-02-07 23:51:55,"Depression is such a shitty thing, it's like a little guy goes into your brain and has a negative answer to every positive thing you think about. And just when you think you've pushed him out of your brain and he's gone forever, one small event will cause him to resurface. This is when you realize that you never actually got him to leave. Nope, you just dug a hole, shoved him in, and buried him under piles of artificial goals and routine and superficial relationships, hoping you would become so immersed in being a pawn in the game of society that you would forget he was even there. But reality is there, underneath all of it. You know that it means nothing to score a summer internship, to get an A in a class, to make a new friend. What next? You'll want a full time job, to get an A in the next class, to enhance your friendship with this person. For what? The small glint of satisfaction that swiftly leaves minutes after you get what you've been chasing for so long? Is it worth the nights of crying, the hours of disappointment, the days of contemplation of your own self-worth when something comes in the way of your chase? 

The shitty thing about depression is it makes you realize that life is this game. But that knowledge is not helpful. In fact, it's agonizing, knowing you are just this pawn following societal norms and the laws of physics and there is nothing you can do except keep on playing, or cease to exist."

4923,2016-02-07 23:45:15,"My roommates and I sent the following message to a group of four young men.  Do you think they will show?

Dear guests,

We invite you to participate in a one-in-a-lifetime opportunity.  Soon our soft and sculpted flesh will be locked in a passionate entanglement.  With your chiseled masculinity, we hope to unite our visceral senses to achieve a sensuality only attained by the gods.  In our secluded tower, four elegant rockets will surge into the chasms of our beings.  As our collective* spirit soars to the source of perfect bliss, the moans will be heard across the Charles.  This will be the pinnacle of our existence.

We have provided a few guidelines to make our first ever orgy a banging success.  Please arrive on Saturday, 02/13, at 10pm, in a sober (or mildly intoxicated) state.  While you may need a little liquid courage to dive into the ocean of bodies, consent is more valid when given freely and soberly.  Experimentation is key to the art of the orgy, so remember to share your body with all in the room.  Hosts will give out party favors, but such favors must be received with humility of spirit.

We have carefully selected each of you to be our chosen guests.  We have decided to preserve your anonymity until the night of revelation.  We are counting down the seconds until the euphoria will come.

All yours,
(removed for privacy)

* The authors of the above invitation do not, in fact, believe sex to be an inherently collective activity.  However, for the purposes of an orgy, collectivism is essential.  The authors dislike this aspect of the orgy but would like for you to comprehend their purely selfish intentions in hosting this event.  Please read the following quote for further clarification.

""Sex is the most profoundly selfish of all acts, an act which they cannot perform for any motive but their own enjoyment - just try to think of performing it in a spirit of selfless charity! - an act which is not possible in self-abasement, only in self-exultation, only on the confidence of being desired and being worthy of desire. It is an act that forces them to stand naked in spirit, as well as in body, and accept their real ego as their standard of value."" - Ayn Rand, Atlas Shrugged"

You will still be, and must stay here. You are the only thing that I will not want to part from and perhaps my time here at MIT has one more thing to teach, and it is the painful lesson of a relationship that has reached its end but not necessarily in the heart."

And it often kicks me in ass, but I frankly wouldn't have gone anywhere else and I definitely don't regret coming here. I know other people here hate it and/or are having a really hard time here and those people certainly have a right to that opinion. But people constantly tell me something along the lines of ""Oh, you like MIT? That's because you're a freshman, you'll hate it eventually."" or ""Everyone hates this place."" or ""No one actually cares about other people here."". Sometimes, it's nastier than that. Look, I understand that you may not like MIT and that as I get older it will get harder, but just stop bitching about it for the sole purpose of making me feel as bad about going here as you do. It's not funny, or cool, or whatever. It's downright obnoxious. You may be doing it to let out some anger, but its not fair it's not fair to try to convince someone that if their not miserable, they're doing it wrong. You have the right to feel how you feel, but so do I. I spent my whole life hating going to school especially because of bullying and race issues in my town. I literally would not get out of bed for school some days. College is literally my last chance to have a good experience in school. Give me a chance to decide for myself if I really like this place.

4968,2016-02-03 11:13:35,"In response to #3460, I don't know what other occasion you don't want to describe, but people can help you. You can talk to someone about what happened to you, many people think that would make things better; you can also just ignore it like I chose to.
Since I was little I received unwanted attention from many people, from little things, such as some guy showed me his penis before I was 10, to something worse. But there was one particular guy, who would kiss me against my will on many occasions. The first time it happened, I was 12 and I got angry and punched him in the face. Everyone around me said that I overreacted and really nothing was wrong, so since then I never cared when someone kissed me or touched me when I didn't want to. Since then I got angry one more time: when I was 14, one guy, whom I was really close with and trusted a lot, held me down for another guy because it was just a game or at least started as a truth or dare. This past summer a guy got me drunk to have sex with me. He was holding me down on a bed with the weight of his body, and as I was resisting and asking him to stop, he was just laughing and telling me that I wanted it. The following day I hanged out with him and other old high school friends like nothing happened, I guess I became insensitive to whatever people would do to me.
After coming to MIT, I for the first time in my life realized that what has been happening before was not the way things are supposed to be. It was the first time here when I learned what word ""consent"" meant. I'm not saying that nothing unwanted can happen to you here, but I'm saying that there are many nice people, whom you can trust, and you can have very positive experiences."

It's no longer questioned, just accepted as orthodoxy. So to anyone out there who questions the science behind it.

It's like we finally have a society that allows people to freely express themselves, and some old guy running a company makes us put on these clothes we don't want to wear to pretend that we are excited for a job that we are only doing for money. Like, I can show up to a nice restaurant, court, a wedding, a funeral, or another formally formal event in jeans, a t-shirt, and a beanie. Why can't people move on from the you have to put on a suit for a job or a job interview mode?"

But it is so irritating, I am happy in love with my girlfriend, why do they think that it is wrong? I did everything right, went to a good school, got good grade, responsible, etc. Now they are telling me that coming to MIT might have been a mistake, because MIT somehow turned me gay. I really wish they would just understand that I am happy the way I am and there is nothing wrong with that and they can accept me (long shot)."

4998,2016-02-02 12:40:35,"- More people should be making confessions.
- For example, my ex-UROP supervisor asked me tonight if I wanted to go see a movie.  He is married.  And like >30.  And, by the way, no.  First of all, I thought this was going to be a work meeting, I did f*king excellent work in your lab while you went on coffee breaks, and you're the one who still hasn't written the paper yet, even though I've done all the data analysis for you.
- Second of all, I finally looked up what constitutes sexual harassment today.  And I realized that, two years ago when my other ex-UROP supervisor asked at the beginning of my Freshman IAP if I'd had sex (in hindsight wtf?), and I said no, and he proceeded to describe to me what I was missing out on (at work, mind you, in a low voice), and then, when no one was around, to show some videos.  For me to ""better understand.""  I realized that this was not, in fact, a favor he was doing me.
- That day when some weird man followed me around.  To the library.  To turn in my pset.  To the stud.  Then finally tapped me on the shoulder and asked me if I had a UROP, because I ""looked like I could be a good fit.""  He didn't even ask what my major was.  I had to tell him no a second time the next week.
- This is just 3 examples.  I can think of at least one more.
- I can't unsee or unhear any of this.
- For the record: yeah, I'm supposedly attractive.  And that shouldn't have anything to do with this.  I didn't ""deserve"" it.  F*ck you.  Do you also believe in Social Darwinism?  I’ve come this far because I work really hard, I’m dedicated, passionate, and curious.  I know that, you know that, it’s a fact, and don’t make me or anyone else question it.
- So I'm saying it here.  In the hopes that all of MIT will not unsee and unhear this.
- Please, if anything like this is happening to you.  Or happened.  Get yourself free from that person now.
- And if anyone knows what I should do, let me know.
- Also for the record: if you're one of the few men who doesn't just want sex, then I probably can't sort you out from the rest. Even if you're a great man. Good luck gaining my trust, and sorry I'm stereotyping you (I'm so sorry!). It's called survival, personal experience, and defiance. Sucks for me, and sucks for you.
- I challenge you who are trustworthy to try to break these walls, reminding myself that I need to keep them out of disrepair even while I want them broken down.
- Actually, if you create a culture of harassment, however ""mild,"" the only thing you're doing is helping us all keep our walls strong.  Raising my bar to love.
So don't do it.  You're the one that's losing.  Losing face, and making me stronger, helping me build up my walls (thanks for showing me I need them), making me more driven to succeed, in the face of your weakness.
- But please.  Never do it again.  (Please?)  Because I hear a lot of people don't use it as fuel for their career drive.
- Is this the real reason why there are so few women at the highest levels of academia?  I’m becoming more convinced: being a totally peer-evaluated enterprise, it’s a respect issue on the part of the men.  I can only hope that the rest of my life leads me to consider other possibilities."

5019,2015-12-19 16:40:22,So does getting a D in 7.012 mean you have to take it again? Regardless of your class?
5020,2015-12-19 16:28:24,"7.03 is the most poorly taught class I have ever taken so far. It is very unorganized, and poorly structured. On top of that, there are very few available resources to study, and the grading system is very obscure and ambiguous. The professors are amazing researchers (apparently), but they are not very understanding of the students. They need to reflect upon themselves, think about the days that they were once students, and put in SOME effort into making sure that students learn and firmly grasp the presented material so that they can one day ACTUALLY apply what they learn. I will not specify which of the professors said this, but when he said that a class average on an exam around 60 is ""good"", I could not believe he could have such philosophy. Every 7.03 exam this semester was somewhat unfairly written, in that some of the content of the exam was barely touched upon in lecture OR had material that we should have had more exposure to prior to being tested on it. I did not fail the class, if anyone is wondering why I'm ranting about 7.03. I did quite well, considering how the class is run, but I cannot believe this is the way that this class has been taught in the previous fall semesters. There definitely needs to be change if MIT wants its students to focus on learning the presented material, NOT freaking out about the obscurity of grades and having to clean up after the professors for their lack of organization and structure."
5021,2015-12-19 16:12:25,"I should have realized that acting cavalier about suicide was a symptom. Once it got to the point where I couldn't joke about it, I shut myself in my room and avoided nearly all social contact. Being isolatory and misanthropic was my only way to cope, but that isn't me. I just couldn't help it. 

Despite the fanfare made about mental health here, I've found almost no reprieve in my peers. Frankly, everyone avoids you when you start showing symptoms of being a loon. No 20ish year old is equipped to handle someone who is truly mentally ill, and neither are most therapists. It's folly to think otherwise. 

If you are in chronic, acute, unmanageable pain, get away from MIT before you hurt yourself. Dr. Lejeune at mental health and Dean Mthembu at S3 may be able to help. Recognize coping mechanisms (addictions, abnormal cognitive patterns, outbursts) for what they are, and seek change that doesn't involve heights or sharp objects. Best of luck to you, and enjoy the break."

Some people are arguing that we are white washing history and pretending that history didn't happen. I want to take a moment to clarify why not. What we are doing with these old Confederate monuments is a classic movement in history. When you beat someone in a war, you get the spoils. This includes destroying all their history, monuments, legacy, you name it. When Rome beat Carthage, they salted the earth, burned everything to the ground, and destroyed all their texts, and historical evidence. Or when Cortez conquered the Aztecs and proceeded to not only destroy their capital, but build Mexico city on it and wipe out their language. When you win a war, you for all essential purposes win the other side as property to do whatever you like with, and as enemies, you have no rules or limits on what you can do. The sons of Confederate soldiers should be glad we only want the statues."

It's easy to forget, constantly seeing so many cold, spiky exteriors that are just shells hiding all these beautiful people. But it's such a community, with the silverware/food/couch/everything kleptos; we all live together like a family and send out angry/threatening/'stop taking my red sweater get your own and grow up damn it' emails like a dysfunctional family. 
I was reading MIT confessions and I saw the hatred for the Burton-Connor lady and then there was the Senior Haus confession. We lovingly tease our housemaster and AD and house manager; I have yet to see any actual tension arise between residents and the house team (except in the case of Ken meets fire hazard but that's more of a Ken-fire-hazard personal issue) and it's one of the few things that truly make finals week significantly better. 
Seeing the stark contrast between how we feel about our house team and the BC people, how many haus people respond to haus confessions in fun ways, it hits home that the reason I'm still here is because there's no other place that I could imagine being even relatively happy. I'd rather be holed up in my room psetting/studying 80% of the day here than anywhere else because, at the end of the day, yes, it is the most unique place I've ever seen."

Our experience with her has been so bad that I'm afraid to show any sort of dissent.  I know someone has to stand up to her, but I don't know how to do so without getting my floor in trouble too."

5085,2015-12-16 19:19:31,"I'm actually a high school senior who applied EA to MIT. Decisions come out tomorrow (12/16) and we hear back at 6:28 (2pi?) pm. I'm dying to know if I made it or not. I've even been checking my horoscope for tomorrow for a hint. I just want to take the most intense science classes there are and be a part of your geeky, nerdy community. (saying that with total admiration and respect.)"
5086,2015-12-16 19:02:32,"Its finals week and I am doing everything other than studying. Its not because I dont like my subjects or I am good at them. I lost all motivation to study, more like I dont see what I will be able to make out of doing all this when none of these have improved my personal life in any tangible way in so many years. I made my way all the way from a Bachelors to a Masters to now a PhD here at MIT and ignored / gave up on personal life all the way. Now that I am finally here, I have nothing to look forward to or live for. I am in a huge rut and it has been coming. I don't even know how to come out of this. I am nowhere close to being socially awkward or a nerd. I had some great friends over the way but I always sucked when it came to asking a girl out - so much that it took me a long long time to even ask one out. I had a couple of bad relationships and decided to focus on getting into MIT instead. Moving here, I feel intimidated by the pace at which people work and I just save myself the upcoming embarrassment. I am no longer sure what to do next, or why I am even writing this."

5090,2015-12-16 19:21:39,"Hey MIT... So here's the deal. I've been going to MIT for a little less than a year now, and I've seen it evolve from the friendliest part of Boston into a machine that can fuck people up and do serious damage IRL. I know it is fucking impossible to get a long discussion going on here, so I might post this a couple times, but i hope it doesn't become copypasta...but hopefully this will help things get going.

MIT, unlike anything else that has ever existed in the world to this point, has an awesome power. It is a place where thousands of people can get together and without any sense of order, and tons of porn thrown in, affect real life. MIT Confessions shows us just the tip of what we are capable of. We are a generation who doesn't give a fuck about the world, because frankly the world has fucked us over. But we still want to make an impact, and let people never forget that we were here. If you've ever seen Fight Club, or more importantly, READ (i know you MITches read, don't lie) Fight Club, you'll know what I'm talking about. This is our chance to rebel, to throw off society, and bitchass consumerism, and everything pathetic about our lives (cause let's be straight, most of us aren't living how we hoped we would). MIT offers a world where, just like FIGHT CLUB, there are no rules (except for CP), and most importantly, THERE IS NO LEADER (even Tyler Durden didn't lead fight club). Let the legion revolution begin here, tonight. we can use MIT to rebel, to create chaos, to make people recognize that we are a real force."

5109,2015-12-15 19:17:22,"Anne McCants is one of the most repulsive creatures I've ever had to interact with at MIT. She is completely unfit to be a housemaster or role model for students, and has been trying to impose her own belief system on the Burton Conner dorm by suppressing student culture. She is completely out of touch with the students she claims to serve, refuses to listen to their concerns, and fails to advocate for their well-being. She is a source of pain, stress, and frustration for students, and actively goes out of her way to prevent socialization betweenus by false accusations, appealing minor complaints to higher administration, and ignoring student opinions about student life in the dorm. MIT should sack this cunt."

I don't do this on purpose, and I don't try to hurt anyone, but it just kind of happens with all my friends, partners, and even communities, and I'm really tired of it all.

It is a teacher's job to help make these goals attainable for every single student in the class. The point is not for tests and projects to be mindless hurdles to separate ""A students"" from ""B students."" Do not for get how brilliant you are and the amazing things you have achieved. If you are trying your hardest and not understanding a a subject, you are not failing the class--the class failed you. The only way to beat the system is to learn everything you can for the sake of learning and use your knowledge to do wonderful things :)"

I then turned to my grinning roommates and angrily asked, ""Who put coffee in my whiskey?"". They know how I like my morning whiskey, straight up."
5170,2015-12-13 22:32:24,"To look at me you would view me as the average, eighteen year old, biology major, freshmen girl. What you probably don't know is that every night I partake in almost scandalous double life. Every night around 10P.M after I finish studying I turn off my light, pull the covers over me, reach into my pants, and it begins. I am on the doorstep of a two story house. I am on the doorstep of a two story house because the invitation I received three days ago via Facebook informed me that this was the address I was supposed to be at for a beach themed party that is to be held. Being a beach party my attire consist of pink bra and panties. I enter and as is to be expected at a college party here is an abundance of alcohol. I go to the bar and get a drink. A whiskey please I request of the bartender. one Whiskey coming up he replies. He retires to the back to get me my whiskey. Aren't you a little light wait for something so strong a voice says. I turn to see who is inquiring me and I come face to face with Travis Barker. Well, should I say a Travis Barker look-a-like. It's a girl. That much is certain. Her bone structure gives it away. If I was a tad bit more intoxicated id take a run at her. we begin a conversation. She informs me that she attends a local college in the san Antonio area and that like me she is a biology major. The most surprising thing of all is that she's a cheerleader. she claims she does it to be around all that coochie. After drinking for about thirty minutes I realize that I've gained quite an appetite and I declare that what I could really use right now Is a krispy kreme donut. A look of intense pleasure comes over the Travis barkers look-a-likes face. What did you say? I said what I could really use right now is a krispy kreme donut I repeat. Come with me she says. We make our way to her car outside which happens to be a ford ram 1oo. She opens the back of the truck and then picks me up and sets me on the hood. She kisse me hard and by thispoint I am so intoxicated I don't care who it is all I know is that this kiss is making me hot all over. My nipples are harder than metal. My vagina is shooting out hot liquid. She kisses me and makes her way down. She kisses my boobs. She then take off my panties and puts he head down there. the moment her lips touch my naughty area I squirt and I squirt hard.. I moan. Shush she say. lets not arouse suspicion. She continues. my cooch gets wetter as she explores every inch of my naughty are with her toungue. I squtirt again. This time harder than before. All the recent heavy rainfall int he san Antonio are can not account for the ocean that is eruopting from me. She continues. by now shes foubd my coveted g spot and the way she s hitting it with her toungue is causing me to have hot flashes. After fifteen hits with her tongue I explode and moan as I have never done before. She lifts her head up with the evidence of my orgasm on her lips. she says my turn. As I drive home that night I feel pretty shitty. I just slept with someone and they didn't t even by me dinner. What an easy lay I am. But then I look in my rearview mirror and I see the evidence of her orgasm on my lips and I think to myself well a t least she bought me a krispy kreme donut."

5172,2015-12-13 22:08:26,"I've been struggling with depression for the last few years now. In general I will only ever ask for help as an extreme last resort. In addition talking about my feelings is even less appealing to me. 

Despite this, I've gotten to the point where I've literally said to my friends ""I'm pretty depressed"" in the hopes that I could get some support from them. As a result they kinda just say some words of encouragement and I end up just letting the topic change. None of them have ever struggled with mental health issues and don't seem even capable of registering what it means to be depressed and to be honest I get the feeling that they just don't even give a fuck. 

It took everything I had to admit to them that I was depressed and they can't even help me and don't seem interested in trying. It's extremely discouraging to think that I don't have a single ""friend"" that could even remotely relate to some of the things that I feel. 

I've tried talking to people at mental health but it just makes me really uncomfortable to talk about something so personal with a complete stranger. 

Guess I'll just have to keep struggling by myself."

5194,2015-12-12 17:13:16,"When lacking motivation to start a pset, clearly what's needed is incentives. Orgasms. I'll give myself one if I do half of it. Or a quarter. Or just this subproblem, which is obviously the meat of this entire pset anyway since it is taking me so long. Wait, actually, I'm horny *now*. Whoops.

It's gotten worse since freshman year, since now I've been to trained to think of nighttime as work-time. It's midnight and the essay is due at 10am? Great, I have 10 whole hours. I can do anything in 10 hours. I can drive to Chicago in 10 hours. I can probably do a whole semester-long project in 10 hours.

Whoops.

Sometimes it feels like the problem is procrastination, and sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes I want to beat myself up for dicking around, partying, binge-watching whatever it is, throwing away entire weekends. But sometimes it feels like I'm doing the maximum amount of work per week possible while still staying sane.

Precious, precious time.

Last time I asked, this time I have to implore. Last time I begged, this time I have to grovel. Please please please I need an extension. Take pity on me! Observe: genuine, salty tears! Taste them!

I have no sympathy for myself.

I should have started earlier. Every damn time. You were doing something else yesterday? You should have started that earlier, too. And so on. You have four tests this week? And when did you become aware of this? That's right.

The only valid excuse I can think of for assignments given WEEKS ahead of time is if somehow all the material required wasn't taught until a couple of days before the assignment is due. But that really doesn't happen very often.

I used to wish the stakes were higher, quicker. Immediate pain. No, I am not an adult with more than 24 hours' foresight. For fuck's sake, schedule my day for me. Give me zero-tolerance late policies. Mandatory mini-checkpoints for long-term projects. Someone to whip me if I don't go to bed on time.

But I'm not even sure it would work anymore. If my life depended on an assignment due next Friday at 10 a.m., and I know beforehand that I will be forced Thursday night to go to bed at 10 p.m., then, well, it would probably be the end of me.

Can anyone spare a little willpower? We'll just hook our brains up with a plastic tube. I have cash."

Ladies chivalry is motherfucking dead I tell you! Dead! It has to be dead when youre fiancé in the heat of reaching the climate of his sexual excitement decides to deposit the evidence of that heightend sexual excitement on your face. Wtf? No motherfucking respect none. He didn't even ask me if he could facial me. That what bugs me. He didn't straight up and ask could he start cinco de mayo early on my face, he decided to cum(pun intended) without any formal invitation. And why my face? Why my motherfucking freckle free face? He could have cum any where else? My tit, my stomach, my arm, hell even my hair. But no. he had to fucking cum on my face. Ladies I don't think I need to tell you that the face of a lady is the window to the soul, the key to her inner workings, the mechanics of her deign. A woman's face is her temple. It is also her weapon. A woman's face Is a weapon. A weapon whose greates attribute is that it conceal. O how it can conceal. Heartbreak, disappointment, anger, resentment. Yes our faces hide all behind a smile. That's what I gave him a smile. As I was I situated on my knees, face covered in his baby gravy. I gave him a smile. Why. To rlay a message. To relay him a message. Everything is allright. Eveyrthing is ok. The fact that you just deposited your stinky load on me is inconsequential. Two minutes later as he feasted on my mossy bank I moaned. O how I moaned. Not because he is a skilled pussy eater. Oh no. He cant eat pussy worth shit. He can throw down in the bedroom but eating pussy is not his specialty. But still I moaned. I moaned for my revenge is perfect. Tomorrow I start my period. Tomorrow according to the calendar is when the parting of the red seas begin. And I'm gonna make damn sure he's in the same position he's in now. Ironically he hates twilight.

David Wallace has made it this big so that some of these products can actually go on and be startups. Additionally, it's up to you to invite people to your capstone presentation. I won't claim 2.009 is harder than any other capstone design class because I know that it's not true. But when it comes to scale of publicity and money it makes sense because of the number of students and sponsors of the class. Wallace has been teaching the class for 20 years, this allowed him to create the relationships necessary to get the sponsors. Also the TA's, professors and course staff put a ton of time and effort into making this spectacle happen. They may sleep even less than most of the students."

Or, if only for a second, my parents could truly see me and not that perfect image that they have, if they could stop making up excuses for me, and just accepted that I am not that smart, and not that hard-working - pretty lazy, in fact. If they could just see that there is nothing left of their perfectly righteous child and accept it and still love me. But no, no matter how hard I try to open their eyes, they just won't listen. But even if one day they do see the light, I know it would break their heart. I am just so tired of everyone assuming I am this brilliant and self-confident person, who is also an angel at heart. I am not. I am neither of those three things. The worst part, if people knew, they wouldn't respect me as much.

I already have an intense worry of boundaries being crossed while feeling powerless.  No alcohol before hookups.  And too many times I've paused a situation progressing fast instead of just relaxing and going with it, in the worry that he could hurt me and I'd feel like I was too far in to say no.
Even with men well versed about consent. Kind, intelligent friends and confidants.  I thought I was being overly paranoid and overly empathic for imagining myself in the shoes of survivors I know. I so instinctually fear rape.  And it seems, rightly so."

Here's why, nobody can really talk about it without character assassination. If you talk about it and you're white, you get called a racist, if you are black, you get called an Uncle Tom. Everyone is too afraid to have an honest discussion, so lets stop pretending we are going to have one, and just keep the message honest and simple.

The point is that this is creating a hostile environment for non believers such as myself. Does anyone know a way I can make them take it down? I'm tired of being discriminated against."

As hard as it is to believe homicide is at a 30 year low in this country and keeps dropping every year. You are far more likely to die in a car accident then by a gun death, yet nobody panics getting into their car in the morning. Most people who are murdered are murdered by someone they know, not a stranger. Mass shootings are so rare, and make up less then 1% of all homicides in this country. It's so statistically low that you should be more worried about dying from a big fall, or rare cancers, which kill far more people. To give you an idea, roughly 10,000 people are murdered with guns in this country, mostly with small hand guns. This may sound like a lot, but we have around 70,000 people die in car accidents, 500,000 die from heart disease, another 500,000 from cancer, it goes on and on. The point is, pray, talk, and mourn these tragedies, but don't harm yourself by worrying about something so unlikely to happen. The media is making a circus out of it to make money."

I know I'm incredibly lucky to be given a chance, and I know there are going to be rough patches and who knows how long it'll last, but is it so wrong to explore what a relationship is like with an optimist outlook?

I'm sure later jaded me is going to read this and laugh, but is it so wrong to be innocent for right now?"
5340,2015-12-06 11:38:12,"We are jealous of friends at other colleges that have naked runs around finals.  So let's have one at MIT!  We will start a tradition, the Infinite Streak, that on the night before finals begin every term (Sunday, Dec 13, this term), we meet in Lobby 7 just before 10pm, and at exactly 10pm, strip naked, and run down the Infinite and back.  All are welcome and hopefully we'll get a good gender mix of runners along with some spectators to cheer them on. It will be a great way to relieve stress. Please spread the word and like and share this with your friends, dorms, frats, sororities, clubs, teams, etc.  Start a tradition of doing the run within your group, or start your own goal of doing 8 of 8 naked runs.
(FAQ: Why down the Infinite and back and not a loop? If someone wants to stop, they don't have to finish a loop. Those enjoying it can even go out and back again.  What do I wear when I show up?  Clothes or a towel.  Where do I leave the clothes?  In Lobby 7, since that's where the run ends.  Why doesn't the run go outside?  Safety in the cold weather - even UC Berkeley stays inside.  What about cameras?  Spectators and runners alike will probably bring their cameras to document the run and we can't stop them.  Do I have to be totally naked?  It's encouraged, but we certainly can't require it.)
tl;dr - Dec 13, 10pm, Lobby 7, strip and then naked run down and back the Infinite"

And it was also my sophomore fall when I came the closest to following through on those desires. But things did get better, and I am so, SO glad that I am not dead now. It took a lot of crap to get from there to here, but it truly has been worth it. For me medication was involved. If you haven't tried it, may as well give it a shot before doing something you can't undo.

5369,2015-12-03 02:10:10,"@ #3071 If you don't mention any suicide plans, I am 99% sure they will not kick you out. Even desire to self harm shouldn't do it as long as you don't describe it as at the level of seriously considering suicide. This is coming from someone who WAS forced to leave. I said A LOT to S^3 and Mental Health before it got to that point. Try going back to S^3 and asking to see Miri Skolnik. She has always been super sensitive in my experience. Also, to you and anyone else, if you are seriously contemplating suicide, please get help even if you are scared of getting kicked out. MIT IS NOT WORTH DYING OVER.Yes, sometimes withdrawals are coerced (which, of course, is pretty concerning), but it takes a decent amount to get there, more than suicidal thoughts, if a low level of intent is expressed. And if you do have to leave, there is a decent chance you will be able to come back eventually. Plus, you can always see a therapist outside of MIT. No risk of withdrawal then :)"

5374,2015-12-03 01:20:16,"Why is it so necessary to have faculty that are similar to students? What happened to diversity? We don't have the right to be comfortable, and moreover, unfamiliar perspectives are good for building character and learning about yourself and the world. Of course, if there are truly negative circumstances or unfair treatment, that is unacceptable. But if someone feels discouraged simply because they see nobody like them in their field, I'm sorry, they must not want it enough. Obviously I cannot speak for all minorities, but as one myself, I don't feel a need to be surrounded with people just like me. That's not how we grow.

I'm barely getting by, even with all the resources in the world. I sometimes wish I had an awful life where I was discriminated against and had terrible parents... if only someone who deserved it could take my place. That way I wouldn't have to feel guilty on top of everything else. Then I could feel pride in accomplishing anything, rather than despair at not accomplishing enough. I know it's petty, and disgraceful white whining. But when someone comes up to me or posts on facebook about how no one white can understand suffering, it just makes me so mad and guilty at the same time. If we can take racism seriously, why can't we take depression seriously? Why do we get to rally behind the former, but pretend the latter doesn't exist? I'm truly proud of all those succeeding despite discrimination; I only wish we could follow their example and unify, support each other."

5395,2015-12-01 18:37:54,"I also have always had this feeling that I'm not going to live a very long life. I've never been able to imagine myself living past 40, tbqh. But I've never made actual plans to kill myself. I find a lot of comfort in the inevitability of death. Even if I do nothing at all, I'll die eventually. Regardless of what (if anything) comes afterwards, it's really something that I look forward to.  
I know I'm going to die early, but I felt like it would happen by natural causes, or at least, causes out of my control. Like, I'd be randomly hit by a car, or caught in the middle of some tragic accident, or have a sudden heart attack, or die in my sleep from some unknown disease. Regardless of how bad life got I could rest assured that it would end eventually, and much sooner than for most people. At some point in highschool, I decided to make ~37-40 my limit. If by some freak chance I managed to still be alive at 40 years old, I'd go ahead and let myself kill myself, as selfish as that is.
But lately, it seems like the best decision that I could make for myself would be to end it all now. Not /right/ now, but maybe sometime before the start of next semester. Don't worry, I haven't made any plans yet. I'm trying to figure out how to create buffers for my friends and family. They're why I'm so hesitant to go this route, tbh. There's no way to completely shield them from the pain-- the confusion, the guilt-- my death will cause them. It's not their fault. Heck, it's not even MIT's fault. I don't have any anger right now for anyone (except maybe myself). This semester (sophomore) has been hard. It started out badly and only got progressively worse. I can imagine that things might have gone better had I picked different classes, or if I was someone better at talking about their feelings. Something about this specific combination of personality and circumstance created the perfect catalyst for the most depressive period of my life.
I can (also) usually find solace in the fact that, no matter how bad things get, they always eventually get better. I can't see that happening anymore. I can barely even imagine what it was like to think like that (and that was just a few months ago!). 
I don't want to be a burden to anyone; i doubt they could help anyway. I don't want to increase the number of people who might take my death personally. Maybe if I kept my head above the water for long enough, I'd find a way to pull myself out again. But I doubt it. Time isn't really on my side. and I prefer being at MIT, on campus, to being at home.
I know posts like these are always kind of a downer. I'm sorry for adding more darkness to the impending finals week. I just, felt like I need to write this now."

I may take for granted sometimes my intelligence, but I never forget even for one second that there are other students that work twice as hard as I do and still aren't able to pass classes.

With this in mind, it really bothers me when someone does poorly on a test and when I try to console them or encourage them that they can do better next time, they never take me seriously. They tell me ""you couldn't understand, you've never failed a test before in your life"". They tell me, ""even when you think you've done badly, you still usually beat the average"". 

Since when does doing better than other people define whether we're doing well? Why can't I feel as if I've done poorly if I didn't live up to my potential, no matter how far above or below average I was? It's not about doing better than other people, it's about doing better than you think that you can do.

And even more, since when does our grades define the quality of our lives? Just because I've never failed a test doesn't mean that I don't know what it means to fail, to be disappointed in myself, or to face hardships.

I guess I just wish that people would realize that when I say that I know that they can overcome this, and that it will be ok, they're not empty words. I mean every one of them because I've been there too, even if I never show it."

You lay naked on my bed
as I make love to you masterly
Like a bull on rampage
I thrust and thrust
Charged by your beams and moans

I thrust quickly, with force
you moan and clutch
Red colored lee nails tearing into my skin
as you moan with deep pleasure

please don't stop you urge
yes right there
omg am gonna cum
you vibrate and move in spasms
body completely overwhelmed by ripples of pleasure

You call me master
That was the best you'd ever had, you say
I hope these moments never go away
I beam with satisfaction
I was good at the job. No debate.

Love making was like abstract art
Each thrust akin to the drop of color on a canvas
I would move quickly and deliberately
hitting those spots with my brush
until we built a masterpiece

But now, all that is gone
You no longer call me master
You  no longer say my name
I hear tales about you and your new boo
And I wonder if I should find one too

5438,2015-11-28 15:56:21,"I am an Evangelical Christian here on campus. I don't hide what I am, and most of my friends here are agnostic or atheist. We all get along just fine. One question I frequently get asked, I would like to address here. The question is, ""why doesn't your church do things to be more fun, accept birth control, cohabitation, female priests, and other serious changes"". People usually add to that how those changes would bring back young people in droves. Lets talk about fun, church is not meant to be fun. Church is about learning how to live your life, and to keep you on the right path. Lectures here are not always fun, but you still go, because you understand their need. People who leave church because it's not, ""fun"", are like people who leave lectures here they paid for, they missed the entire point. Next, accepting homosexuality, cohabitation, female priests, etc, etc. The reason we do not do these things is because all of these things are against the core doctrines of our church. We follow the lessons of the bible, the bible strictly forbids cohabitation and birth control violates the spirit of being open to life. We also forbid them because we empathize putting others before yourself, this includes creating stable working families, where you put the needs of the other members before yourself, even if it is at your own detriment. Cohabitation encourages you to seek your own pleasure, above the needs of others. (There is also plenty of psychological research showing this.) Some people have argued against this from a survival standpoint saying we should do it anyway just to get new members. We are not a popularity contest. Jesus when asked if he was king replied, ""My Kingdom is not of this world"". We are not a worldly crowd, nor do we want to be. And even if we were, the majority of students here at MIT would not show up anyway. You would all know that we were changing the doctrines in a cynical attempt to bring you. Did you know there are many new protestant sects that accept homosexuality, female priests, cohabitation, and other things? If you ask why you haven't heard of them it's because they collapse almost as fast as they rise. People stay faithful because faith challenges them, not tells them what they want to hear.

Free speech issues on advertising, lack of precedence, independence of parents, among others. My whole point is, personal responsibility has proven to not be enough to curb the obesity epidemic. People have proven time and time again that they will not make the right choices when it comes to health, and need to be shoved in the right direction whether by manipulation or outright force. Does anyone know any good legal precedents to use to advocate for some of these actions?"

5478,2015-11-26 04:37:35,"I truly wish I had never met you. I am now trying to forget the last 4 years of my life, and this is not something one can leave behind on a whim. 

You know how they say if you want to forget something, you should get rid of everything that reminds you of that experience? I walked around my room, looked into my closet, looked through my books, and realized I would have to burn pretty much everything I own..

And one would doubt that there was nothing good in those past 4 years, but honestly, if I were erase them from my life, I would not feel at loss at all. If I had a chance to turn back time, I would, just to change those 4 years. And I am not saying this merely because I'm in pain. I am saying this because it wasn't a learning experience either: there was nothing I learned from this, or at least nothing that could ever be worth so much of my emotional and even physical health, energy, and time."
5479,2015-11-26 04:22:38,"2888, I still have nightmares about you, not super often, but still.  Either aboutsomehow ""accidentally"" getting back with you once again and putting myself into reliving the pain, or a combination of that and the last few non verbal encounters we had.  I'll get over it eventually, they're just subconscious remnants of trauma. I just really hope you learned for your next relationship.  Never treat someone how you treated me.  Your last message makes me hope you did learn.  You are an amazing person and even though I don't love you anymore I do remember why I loved you and I hope you can share that with someone else.  

I want to say the following because there's a chance it can help someone else:  No relationship is worth emotional/physical abuse. Emotional abuse is very real, because there was no physical damage I used to think it wasn't real/wasn't really affecting me. But it was. When I see him now I get so scared, but not for my physical safety.  I never thought this was possible, a conditioned fear reaction without (much) physical cause. I don't care how much you love them, how good things are usually, how much it feels like you can never love someone as much as you love them.  Do not let them hold you hostage by your love.  If they threaten to break up with you over something absurd in order to control you, let them.  Call theyre bluff, youll see its almost always a bluff.  If they threaten to break up with you, let them and say goodbye. Dont take them back, especially not if this happens repeatedly.  If they say, ""if you really loved me then [insert something they want you to do/not do]"", realize there's a big chance they are trying to manipulate/control you.  Never let someone try to invalidate your emotions or tell you they are wrong/not real.  If you repeatedly argue with them about the same things, and its always them attacking you and you defending yourself, its probably not going to change.  You'll make up, things will seem fine, and it will happen again.  Leave them.  Even if it seems like you can't survive without them, you can, you will adapt and grow and you will be so much stronger and happier because of it.  Losing them will open room up in your life for so much more.  Never let fear control you.  

If you are ever confused or unsure about how you are being treated in a relationship, please ask for help, go to VPR.  They can help you figure out what's going on, which is usually  really difficult if you are blinded by love.  Emotional abuse is so hard to deal with alone because even if you know youre in the right, having to always defend yourself really does affect you in subtle ways and gives them control over you.  Literally the person I talked to at VPR helped me immensely, even though no one has ever been able to help me work through something before in my life. You are strong, you will adapt, and you are worth so much more.

We finally broke up my sophomore year, and the summer afterwards I was raped by someone else. I blame the guy in my first relationship for everything bad that's happened to me, and truly wish that he would suffer or die. I feel guilty for feeling that way.

If you weren't so horrible to me I wouldn't have been strong enough to do it.  I let myself feel the horrible pain of losing you, I let myself feel it completely and didn't try to villify you to stop me from caring.  But finally, I stopped caring.  I stopped thinking about you and feeling like I would see you again.  I used to think we were soulmates, that there was no way we wouldn't die together just based on how close I felt to you.  I still remember but what I can see clearly now is all of the abuse you put me through. That was some text book emotional abuse and it wasn't OK and I will never stay with someone who does even a fraction of what you used to do.  That's why its so easy now to forget you.  After I stopped caring about you I was alone and it was beautiful.  To not have to fucking answer to anyone.  And then I met someone and I fell in love again.  Its different and so much better.  He is so much better to me than you were, he never tries to hurt me, he makes me so happy. I might marry him in the future.  Anyway, i deleted my response so many times because I didn't know where this message would end or exactly what I wanted to say.

I hope you realize how awful it is to be treated poorly by someone you care about. You might just think you're being ""hard to get"" but in reality, you're just being hurtful and destroying that person's self-worth. If this person is ignoring you and pretending they do not know you, you must have hurt them quite a bit. If you really want them to know your sorry, tell them. It might be hard, they might tell you to fuck off, but at least they will know you are sorry."

I felt terrible that I was selectively dating/hooking up with women who were of my race only and ignoring others, and was in fact branded ""racist"" once by a woman to whom I explicitly confessed that I rejected her only because of her race. So recently, out of curiosity, I decided to give in and hooked up with an individual who was of a race I was never attracted to. No matter how much I tried, my cock refused to erect itself in any damn axis and during no second of the whole encounter did I feel sexually aroused.

5567,2015-11-22 17:35:33,"I feel like the question of Syrian refugees is simple, but not in the way I see some people breaking it down. The choice as I see it is A) Does the US accept the refugees, knowing it is likely that some percentage of them will be malicious agents taking advantage of the crisis to immigrate, or B) Does the US accept none of them (or perhaps a third option, does the US accept a subset that is likely to be harmless? Eg. children only, though that would be heartbreaking for those families and not necessarily the best option for those children, etc.).

To argue that innocent refugees should be welcomed because they're decent human beings is to argue against a straw man (Well, it may SHOULD be arguing against a straw man, though some politicians' comments seem to indicate they might actually be opposed to this sentiment...). If governments had divining rods that could tell who was and wasn't intending to perpetrate violence on others, this decision would be much more straightforward.

I just wanted to articulate this distinction. I think it's very possible to be in favor of A) above; but the proper articulation is ""I support accepting all of the refugees, because helping the innocent ones is more important than preventing the damage that might be caused by the malicious agents"", not simply ""I support welcoming Syrians"". (Does this sound accurate to people? I am by zero means a domain expert, here)"

Roses are red
Violets are blue

or no cash for you

WEEK 6:

WEEK 7:
All that is necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men and women to not fill out surveys.

After being put on hold for another minute or two, they told me there weren't any times available for a call, so I would have to fill out the online triage form instead. I was on their web site at the time and didn't see anything about a triage form, so I asked where I could find it. The lady repeatedly told me it was on the web site, but when I still couldn't find any kind of form like that, she finally offered to pull up the website herself so she could guide me to it, then after about a minute of continuing to tell me it was on the MIT Medical site under mental health, she told me she couldn't pull it up right now because there were just too many patients in the office to deal with. That ended the call.

It's interesting because with the #alllivesmatter movement people seemed to argue that it was unjust to claim #allblacklivesmatter because in their eyes, all lives are the same so all lives matter just as much as black ones. However, someone explained to me that the #alllivesmatter movement was hurtful to the racial equality movement because it was devaluing their statement. From what I understood, they saw the target of black lives from the police as meaning their lives matter less. So with their movement, they aimed to emphasize that black lives mattered *just as much* as all the other lives. So, saying ""all lives matter"" as a response was almost the equivalent of saying the problem they were trying to bring to light didn't exist. Now, it seems that bringing up all lives matter when people hurt for Paris is insensitive. But it is hard to ignore that there is definitely inequality in the way conflict and events like these are portrayed in the media.

5700,2015-11-16 12:30:12,"Dear MIT students – please read this. 
In response to #2672 (and #2642):
I was blown away by the amount of logical fallacies in post #2672. I’m going to address a number of points made by the OP:

1. Let’s first consider the political background of one of the speakers: Mads Gilbert stated the following in response to 9/11: “If the U.S. government has a legitimate right to bomb and kill civilians in Iraq, the oppressed has a moral right to attack the U.S. with the weapons they may create as well.” So when the OP claimed that Mads Gilbert is “both extremely respected and knowledgeable on the matter”, I can only assume that he/she respects people that condone or tolerate terror attacks.

2. A second claim raised by the OP is that the differences in casualties between the two sides somehow indicates that Israel is in the wrong.
In WW2, over 1,500,000 German civilians died as opposed to ~70,000 civilians in the UK. Does this imply that in WW2, Germany was the victim and Britain the aggressor?
Loss of human life is absolutely tragic, but the fact that Israel has far less casualties is a product of its spending an extremely high percentage of its GDP on defense. In response to an endless barrage of missiles, it has developed “The Iron Dome”, an anti-ballistic defense system that intercepts missiles in mid-flight.
The relatively low death toll on the Israeli side is not due to any lack of attempt from Hamas (the government of Gaza): In 2014, ~4,000 missiles were launched from Gaza into Israel.

3. The OP claims that “most of the world's countries...are against Israel's actions, but are unable to do anything against the superpower that is the US.”
Really? 
It seems like nearly all democracies support Israel. 
Last time I checked, Hamas (the Palestinian organization that controls Gaza) is recognized as a terrorist organization by the USA, the European Union, Canada, Egypt and Japan.
Who doesn’t recognize it as a terrorist nation?
Russia and Iran among others. How interesting.

4. The final claim is ludicrous: “In Israel's Dahiya Doctrine, they state that their aim is to cause as much destruction and loss of Arab life as possible.”
There could be no greater lie. The Dahiya Doctrine defines Israel’s intention to destroy missile launching infrastructure in terrorist controlled areas. Israel has a strict policy of announcing, in advance, its intentions to attack such areas, to prevent innocent bystanders from getting hurt. 
What more could possibly be done?
But don’t take my word for it. Look up the Dahiya Doctrine and read it for yourself. Call me out if what I’m saying is wrong.

Asides from the sheer monstrosity of targeting innocent people, every time an innocent person is killed, it makes Israel look terrible. What does Israel stand to gain by attacking innocent people?
Absolutely nothing. It only loses. I’m saying this after having served for four years in the Israeli Military. I promise you, I cannot think of anything worse for Israel than killing innocent people.
It’s evil, it’s political suicide, and it just deepens the animosity even further. 
There have been deaths on both sides. Currently, Israel is under a wave of terror attacks that have been condemned world-wide.
My best friend, Malachy Rosenfeld, an Israeli, was murdered four months ago by three Palestinian terrorists as he returned home from a basketball game.
My mother was nearly stoned to death half a year ago as she was driving to work.
My next door neighbor, Segev Avihail, was stabbed and killed in school by a terrorist three years ago.
I’m also an American citizen, and proud to be one. To the anonymous OP – it seems from your words that you aren’t too fond of the USA, or at least you take little regard in idolizing people that condone terror attacks against it.
All I can say is this. Israel is not perfect. Neither is the USA. 
But overall, I think both countries have done the right thing in defending their people and protecting them against those who wish them harm.
There is a lot more that can be said. Those of you who would like to hear more about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict or discuss what’s going on are welcome to contact me – I’d be happy to speak with you about this.

5702,2015-11-16 12:18:14,"BDS Israel!!!
Israel is the devil! Let’s BDS the shit out of them!!!
I totally support the BDS movement that calls for Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions against Israel.
I think Israel deserves to suffer financially for its war crimes, so help me cripple it economically by joining me and many others in the BDS movement!

My only problem with the current state of the BDS movement is that it’s too soft on Israel. I don’t understand why we are such amateurs. Let’s take this movement to the next level and really prevent every single dollar from getting into Israel. 

If we really want to be true with ourselves and BDS then this is what I suggest we do:
1) Boycott Facebook, after all, Facebook has offices in Israel. So by using Facebook we contribute money to a company that then pays salaries to Israelis. So no more Facebook.
2) Boycott Google, after all, Google has offices in Israel and they pay salaries to their Israeli employees. So no more using Google products.
3) Boycott Microsoft, after all, Microsoft has offices in Israel and they pay salaries to Israelis. This shit has to stop. So no more Microsoft products. (Notice that by now we’re starting to run out of technology to use).
4) Let’s not go into the financial industry, because almost all financial firms use Bloomberg’s services. The founder and owner is Michael Bloomberg, a big supporter of Israel. By using Bloomberg we are giving him money that eventually makes its way to Israel. So no more Bloomberg and Wall Street stuff.
5) Next time we go to Vegas, let’s not step foot in the Venetian Hotel, since the owner, Sheldon Adelson, is extremely pro-Israeli and donates a lot of money to them.
6) Boycott Intel, after all, they have a big office in Israel. But, fuck it, most computers contain Intel processors, so no more using computers.

Ok, that’s fine, I don’t really need all of the above. I’m a student at MIT, I can take classes here using only a pen and paper and reinvent all of this technology by myself. I just need to take 6.046 to help me with the algorithms.

7) Oh shit, gotta boycott 046 because all three professors are Israelis. Fuck it, I kind of liked that class.
8) Boycott MIT. Come on?! MIT too?! Yes, my friend, also MIT. MIT pays salaries to its Israeli professors and allows Israeli students on campus. I know, a real crime against humanity. So, gotta drop out of MIT.

Ok, I’m going back to live in a cave. BDS Israel!!

I think it would be great to have a group of 10 students or so at MIT with all different views on the political issues that have been so vehemently discussed on MIT confessions and elsewhere to have an open discussion where other MIT students can watch and listen. I think it would be informative, even cathartic to some, and encourage openness and help all students learn more about different views and perhaps get closer to the truth.

5737,2015-11-15 01:20:20,"#2710, in response to #2672: (this comment was also posted on 2672's thread)

To the ignorant person who wrote confession #2672,
allow me to crush your arguments.

Why the fuck do you think we should trust Chomsky?! or even worse, Gilbert, for that matter?! The fact that Chomsky is a brilliant linguist doesn't mean he can tell right from wrong, it just means he can tell ""a"" from ""b"".

I can see that you are very impressed by numbers, so let me satiate your hunger for numbers with a few more examples. In WW2 approximately 1,000,000 German civilians were killed as opposed to approximately only 10,000 Americans and 100,000 British civilians. Following your logic, you must be thinking ""oh, those cruel Brits and Americans! They had so few deaths and yet they slaughtered the poor Germans"". This is a perfect analogy to the argument you've presented above with the body count. You don't determine in war who is right and who is wrong by tallying casualties (unless you believe that the allies were the bad guys in WW2).
You should ask yourself why were there so many deaths among the Palestinians and so few among the Israelis? (This is how a mature person approaches serious issues). And the answer is simple, according to Israelis values, civilian lives matter more than soldiers' lives. That is why we send our troops to the front line and keep our population in the back. But for Hamas, this is not the case. For them, it's ""combatants' lives matter more than civilian's lives"" and that is why their combatants are underground, hiding from Israel's bombs, while their children and civilian population is on top, being used as a human shield. Of course, Israel also has Iron Dome, which helps keep the death toll low. But imagine what would the death toll be were it not for Iron Dome? Hamas has fired thousands of rockets at Israeli civilian population. If all of those rockets hit their target then you would have thousands of dead Israelis. Maybe then you would think that Israel is not so bad. 
Also, Israel never shoots intentionally at Palestinian civilians with the purpose of killing them (as opposed to Hamas). So (almost) every time a civilian Palestinian dies it is because he or she were in a proximity of a Hamas militant. If Hamas militants don't want Palestinians to die all they need to do is follow the Israeli method - send their militants to the front line and keep the civilian population in the back. I assure to you, there would be 0 civilian casualties in that case.

Talking about the UN, if I remember correctly, it says something about that it's not morally right to fight within a populated area. Then why is Hamas fighting within populated areas?! If you were Israel, and you would have someone firing at you from within populated areas, you wouldn't stand by and pray for the rocket to miss, you would take that shooter down. If a civilian dies in the action, then the blame is on the shooter who was near him. And don't let people tell you that Gaza is so densely populated that Hamas has no choice but to fire from within civilian population. I know of a few open fields in Gaza that can be used as fantastic launching sites. Why doesn't Hamas uses them?... Now, the fact that Gilbert says that he didn't see and combatants near or in the hospital, doesn't mean that that is indeed the case. Hamas headquarter is underneath the Shiba hospital, not in the emergency room. Of course he wouldn't see them. There was a secret military base only a mile away from my home - I never found out of its existence until I joined the military. Conclusion - civilians don't notice things that are not supposed to be noticed!

Now to Israel's doctrine. Unlike Chomsky and probably you and many others, I don't need to read it. Nor do I need to even read about the conflict. I don't even need external sources to teach me about this. I am Israeli. I am the source. I have served in the IDF. I have followed the doctrine. You are simply wrong (or worse, lying). Israel does not aim to cause as much destruction and loss of Arab life. Israel only seeks to cause as much destruction and loss of terrorist lives. And the distinction is important. When I served in the IDF I was ordered NOT to kill civilians. We would do everything in our power to avoid hurting civilians. But sometime avoiding it is impossible because war is not a nice thing. If an Israeli soldier were to intentionally kill an innocent person then that soldier would go directly to jail. If a Palestinian kills an innocent Israeli then that Palestinian immediately gets ""fame and fortune"" in the Arab world.
If Israel really wanted to be done with the Palestinians then Gaza would have been the world's largest parking lot today. But it isn't. \qed."

5743,2015-11-15 01:37:27,"The number of times I have seen a bicyclist mess around with 18 wheelers THIS SEMESTER ALONE is ridiculous.

One time I saw a guy riding down the sidewalk (mistake 1: there is like a bike lane a yard away in the street) and an 18 wheeler was backing up into the loading dock of the stud.  The back wheels of the 18 wheeler were about to cross the sidewalk and the truck was beeping loudly (reverse beeps) and also the driver was loudly honking his horn.  The guy biked right behind the 18 wheeler.  Somehow (I honestly have no idea how), the driver saw the bicyclist and stopped.  The guy never once glanced at the truck.

A truck had a green left turn light but a bicyclist decided to run a red light and rode right in front of the truck.  Once again, the truck had to stop, but this time the bicyclist appeared out of nowhere and the driver had to stomp on his break.  (Also, btw, bicyclists, stop running red lights).

A bicyclist was once riding down the wrong side of Vassar, while an 18 wheeler was in the process of turning right (on a green light).  The bicyclist decided to ride all the way up to the corner of the intersection and suddenly found himself squeezed by the sidewalk on one side and the large turning truck on the other.  The driver didn't see him (the bicyclist was going down the wrong side of the street so it is reasonable that the driver wasn't even looking there) and the bicyclist started cursing the driver out, screaming and smacking the side of the truck.  Eventually the truck stopped turning and the bicyclist got off his bike and got onto the sidewalk.  But the bicyclist continued to curse out the driver.  The worse part is that this happened right by the white bicycle at the intersection of Mass Ave and Vassar.  The bicyclist was literally yards away from the white bicycle.

Of course, there are a lot more times when bicyclists decide to not obey the traffic laws and almost get hit by cars or almost hit a pedestrian.  I am a bicyclist and often times, I'll stop for a light or because I will see some danger up ahead (a car might be turning right or might be emerging from a garage) and the bicyclist behind me will overtake me and glare.  I was once glared at by a driver for what the bicyclist behind me did (the bicyclist cut her off).  Stop taking chances with your life.  You are giving bicyclist bad names.  There are three simple rules to being a bicyclist on campus - ride in the bike lanes, heed traffic laws and look at the car in the right lane when going through intersections (they might turn right without looking for a bicyclist and they may be wrong, but you could be dead)."

I'm sure MIT is better than most colleges, but I wish people would just be more genuine and talk about things that really matter rather than some interesting philosophical concept.

I prefer not to mince words. Of course we are telling them how to live their lives as middle and upper class people. Poor people have shown time and time again that they do not know which decisions to make in their lives, why do you think they are poor? We aren't doing it to kick them, we are doing it to help them live better. It is our duty as the more fortunate to help those less fortunate, even it involves a little tough love."
5771,2015-11-13 14:16:25,"A previous professor of mine, a predominant figure in his field, makes the same joke in his farewell address every time he teaches his class. The roaring laughter that ensues, is not only confusing, but painful to me because I feel that this joke hugely undermines the progress MIT has made towards racial inclusion. 

I'm not the best at discussing whats racist and whats not--I find my emotions usually get the best of me in these conversations. In the face of these issues, I usually just shrug my shoulders and learn to live with the harm. I'm not trying to impose on his freedom of speech, I just am fearful of what harm this might propagate when you have a very admired professor at a world class institution showing his students that there is no harm caused when making jokes like this.

I almost want to post a link of the joke here (its on OCW and youtube, which is how I suspect he makes the same joke every year), but I'm not sure if it would do any good to publicly shame him and have people comment on his specific word use or debate whether or not what he said was actually harmful. But to me, when someone makes a joke where the punchline is based on the western born stereotype that ""all asians look the same"" , well that brings up a lot of pain, especially if this person is well respected in a community that students of color are trying to thrive in.

Its been a year now, and these memories and this pain still resurfaces whenever conversations of race come up in the news. These videos are still on youtube. And he'll probably make the same joke again this year. I'm looking for some closure or a solution but its not the easiest to talk to people who demand to be convinced with whatever they deem to be logical when the harm is a very obvious experience for me."

5786,2015-11-13 01:37:55,"In response to #2642: I went to the talk on Palestinian Reality and Israel Impunity this weekend. It really blew my mind. I want to summarize some of the things that stood out the most to me. These are coming from Noam Chomsky and Mads Gilbert - both extremely respected and knowledgeable on the matter (you may disagree with Gilbert, but I hope you will still consider his words since he's been actually there for 8 years. At the very least, you can probably trust in Chomsky).

Besides hearing personal stories, one of the hardest hitting statistics was that Israel has killed > 1300 Palestinian citizens, most of which were civilians, including 500 children. Whereas in the same time frame there have been 13 Israeli deaths, 10 of which were soldiers. I'm not saying that ANY person's life matters more than another, or that we should tally up lives, but this difference is staggering. The UN has rules even in times of war. These include for instance minimizing civilian casualties and not attacking hospitals. But Israel's last attack specifically targeted hospitals and ambulances, and even UN shelters. In Israel's Dahiya Doctrine, they state that their aim is to cause as much destruction and loss of Arab life as possible. This is not an acceptable defensive strategy, on the contrary it is in direct violation of human rights and UN law. According to Chomsky, most of the world's countries have recognized this and are against Israel's actions, but are unable to do anything against the superpower that is the US.

I would strongly recommend watching the whole talk if you're looking for the other opinion. It's the most compelling argument I've heard. It's also pretty rigorous - every piece of information is cited. I'm not blindly asking you to believe their claims, but at least the citations and the identities of the speakers should encourage you to not immediately discard the claims, and do further research on your own."

5810,2015-11-12 19:56:39,"I feel like a lot of racial activism portrayed by the media nowadays is very binary. It's always something to do with black vs white when in reality there are other racial minority groups out there that are often forgotten in discussions surrounding racial tension. For example, cop beats up Asian senior, media does not play the race card nearly as much as when a black guy  gets beat up. Discourse surrounding racial discrimination and diversity needs to involve a diverse group of people rather than just a couple."
5811,2015-11-12 19:47:41,"Due to the fact that racialized sexual and dating practices are discriminatory and a plague to our society, I have proposed the following law, which I believe should take effect as soon as legally permissible:

A federal Bureau for Fair Sex (BFS) shall be established with the ability to enforce the provisions described in this law.  Every instance of sexual intercourse, dating, or dancing shall be reported to this Bureau for recordkeeping, along with the race of the sexual intercourse, dating, or dancing partner.  Failure to accurately report this information to the BFS will result in a fine of $1000 for first offense, and an imprisonment term of no less than 1 year for second offense, and an imprisonment term of no less than 10 years for subsequent offenses.  

For each individual, the frequency distribution of the races of said individual's sexual partners shall be computed and compared to that of the racial composition of the United States via a chi-squared goodness-of-fit test.  A chi-squared test statistic shall be computed for each individual.  

Individuals found with confidence in excess of 75% to be racially selective in their sexual preferences shall be fined $1000, enrolled in a mandatory sexual-reeducation class, and required to register as a sex-preference offender.  

Individuals found with confidence in excess of 90% to be racially selective in their sexual preferences shall be required to register as a sex-preference offender, imprisoned for 3 years, and upon release sent to sexual-reeducation camp for 2 years.  Such camps shall be established at the direction of the Bureau for Fair Sex.  

Individuals found with confidence in excess of 99% to be racially selective in their sexual preferences are unfit for this society, and shall be imprisoned for life without possibility of parole.  

Similar provisions shall be established for those who are racially selective with their dating partners and those who are racially selective with their dancing partners.  For racially-selective dancing offenders, the above punishments shall be tripled.

I firmly believe that this law will speedily make our society into a fairer one with equal sexual opportunity for all.  Moreover, my intent in introducing this law is entirely altruistic; as an asexual individual, I have nothing to gain from the benefits this law will confer."

He said no but, ""it's the duty of white people to help dismantle the structures"". I pointed out that this was just another way of saying white guilt and he started getting angry. I then pointed out that if it is my duty to dismantle the structures and he can't succeed with them in place, then it was my duty to help him. I pulled out my wallet and offered him a 20 dollar bill smirking at him, saying he clearly needed it, and it was my duty to give him what I could as his oppressor, to succeed in my evil white world. He smacked my hand away screaming in rage that I was part of the problem and he didn't need my help. I gave him a choice, admit that he was powerless due to structural racism and needed my charity, or that there is no structural racism, and that he uses it to cover up his own personal failures. He choose to storm out of the house screaming that I was a racist in his eyes.

I feel like I've only managed to hurt everyone around me, and that the world or at least each of my amazing friends would be so much better off without me. And yet I feel that in spite of all of that they're so amazing and nice that they would feel sad/mad at themselves if I do decide to throw it all away, so that's not really an option either. It feels like a fucking Catch-22 for my friends, and I'm the one unwillingly setting it up, like 'either be friends with someone who's bound to hurt you or end the friendship and be happy again but since you're too nice to actually end a friendship, feel guilty about it.' There's a simple solution to all of this, which is that if I truly cared about them as much as I say/think I do I'd just get up and leave their lives forever. And yet what makes me even worse is that because they mean so much to me, I'm too selfish about having them in my life to actually carry that out. (Although the good thing is in another 1.5 years when I graduate it'd be very easy for me to do that) For those of you still reading, thanks, you're the ones that truly care and the world needs ppl like you. You're probably wondering what the point of this is, and it's really just venting. Especially since I can't vent to my friends, S^3, or Mental about this since they're all too nice to give me real talk and simply go with the standard ""you're being too hard on yourself"" despite the fact that I've seen myself do this time and time again. Also, if any of my friends read this, well ofc you wouldn't know it's about you since the point of this is anonymity, but I'd just like to say, you're amazing and I'm truly sorry for everything, you deserve better"

5840,2015-11-11 18:00:39,"This is a confession I've been dying to make for a while. When I was in high school I was on the football team. The team did a hazing ritual with the freshmen. After practice hours on the first Friday, we all were made to run with our shirts off to the local marsh, you stood in there for an hour and had to be still while the mosquitoes ate you. Then we crawled through the mud and ran back to the locker rooms where Lady Gaga's ""I like it rough"" blasted while you got towel whipped by the upper classmen walking by. This was all while they called us every name known to man and mocked us. They got every single one of us to cry, but afterwards, having each other to get through it we were the best of friends. The Saturday after a senior threw a party at his house for the whole team, and they all accepted us as one of their own and had fun with us just to let us all know, it's just part of being on the team and it wasn't personal. The thing I want to bring up is all hazing isn't bad. This ritual served a purpose, to see who really wanted to be on the team, and to make team bonds stronger. I know a lot of people here who would find this barbaric and demand charges be pressed. But, done properly, in a controlled environment, like the one we had, it's no riskier then playing football and helps make you closer friends then you can imagine. Any of the guys from my class from the football team I'm close with in a way of it's own, it's a love I can't describe, but is beyond magnificent."

This video went viral of protesters standing up to a reporter trying to violate their personal space.

Now the critics I have heard argued that the tents were on public space and the reporter had the right to be there due to the first amendment. Legally yes, but should he? I think he was being unethical in violating their safe space, away from peering eyes, and he and the rest of the white media, failed to see that. So for that I commend the students for pushing him that that guy with the video camera away, saying that they need their space, and will do what they must to get it, regardless of the law."

5854,2015-11-11 18:17:16,"I made a confession about college campus handling of sexual assault cases earlier. The feedback was good, but one commenter on it I would like to respond anonymously too. This commenter disagreed with me because she felt that a rape victim should not go the court because it's a long and difficult process where a campus one might be easier. I believe she wants to help people who have been through a trauma and I commend her. I disagree for a couple reasons. The first is, it's a public safety issue as well. Rapists statistically tend to be serial, odds are left alone, they will strike again. This is about making sure the rapist does not strike again. The school has no power to stop the individual, a court can throw the man in jail. Also, even if the court fails to secure a conviction, the man will have an arrest and investigation record for sexual assault. This will help the police keep an eye on him, and may help prosecute him if this ever occurs again. Also, by going to the police immediately they can perform the rape kit test to get blood and semen samples, along with other trauma evidence that is critical in getting rape convictions and will help convince the defendant and his lawyers to plead guilty, as oppose to going to trial. Even if you don't do this immediately you should still go anyway, you may still be able to get the guy convicted on an assault, unlawful sexual contact, or battery charge which is better then nothing, will get him expelled, and keep him from striking again. Yes, if you go to trial the defendants lawyers may imply you are a liar or a slut, it's their job, hate the rapist, not the lawyer doing that he legally has to do.

The issues with going to the school are as follows. The school does not want to do this at all, and will likely default to some wishy washy punishment, such as making the rapist leave for a year, then reenter classes or writing an apology letter, (this has actually occurred at colleges). If you get him in trouble with the school, with no formal court process for sexual assault, you could be sued by the rapist for defamation since you have not proven nor are in the process of prosecuting him for sexual assault. At best you get the guy expelled with no criminal charges, he enrolls in another school where they can't legally find out why he was expelled, and gets the greatest deal ever. And if you lose there, then what? The guy has no criminal record over it, he's off free with the school, and now he's free to continue to prey on girls at college parties."

But I found that taking responsibility for everything that happens in your life is difficult at first, then it becomes empowering and makes you a much stronger more capable person.

People are arguing that it's racist if someone doesn't want to dance with him because he's black. It isn't racist if you aren't generally attracted to a particular race. There's not really a whole lot you can do about sexual attraction. I generally don't find white guys attractive, but that's not to say there are no attractive white guys. Sure, it's racist to say ""white men aren't attractive,"" but it's not racist to say that statistically, I'm not as likely to be attracted to a white male.

Surely, the MIT community must recognize that these costumes make a mockery of me and my condition.  

I've spoken to some other individuals who share my disability, and many of them expressed that they do not feel offended by these appropriative costumes.  Yet, their individual offense is neither necessary nor expected for recognizing offensiveness in general.  It doesn't matter whether they're offended, or even whether the majority of nearsighted individuals are offended.  The only thing that matters is that MIT must make a safe learning space for everyone - including me, and including other nearsighted people who are offended by these costumes, who I'm sure exist but just aren't vocal enough to speak up for themselves.  And as the most easily-offended nearsighted individual in this community, I get the privilege of deciding what is or isn't appropriate here."

5887,2015-11-11 18:14:20,"Before I begin, I would like to emphasize that this has nothing to do whatsoever with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. This confession only has to do with two events I have experienced in the one semester I have been at MIT. I do not have a firm stance on the Israeli- Palestinian conflict. I feel that the complexities of the issue are beyond the scope of my knowledge and experiences. What I do understand a little better, though, is hate, and I am very much anti-hatred. I attribute my strong anti-hatred stance to my grandfather who amazingly escaped Germany during the Holocaust as a child. The rest of his family:mother, father, and older brother, though, could not escape and did not survive. Needless to say, this deeply impacted my grandfather. The most important way he influenced me was through his intolerance for hatred. He taught me that hatred is ignorant and could have a devastating impact if not kept in check. This leads me to two events that, although not unheard of, are very alarming and should not be occurring- especially at MIT. The first occurred a couple weeks ago during office hours. I sat down in an empty chair next to a girl whom I had not seen before. This girl was wearing a hijab. Naturally, I have no idea if she is Palestinian, simply anti-Israel, or what her views are, and quite frankly I could not care less. She's a student at MIT, like me, and she is here to learn, like me. She looked at me, and I smiled (even though the socially-awkward side of me panicked as it does whenever someone looks at me and I had to confirm to myself that my breath didn't smell and that I did shower that day). I did notice, though, that her eyes lingered on the Star of David necklace I was wearing. Without hesitation, she picked up her notes and sat away from me. Obviously, I do not know what she was thinking and maybe she simply could see better further back in the classroom. I did not let this bother me, though if you're reading this, I am sorry if I offended you. The second, more concerning event, happened before the ""Israeli Impunity and the Palestinian Reality"" event. Although I do not agree with the angry and perhaps hateful undertones of this event, I do support free speech and I am happy that students and faculty who are anti-Israel feel safe enough to voice their opinions. I was walking down the Infinite prior to the event; I saw a massive line of people and had no idea what was going on. I asked someone what was going on, and she said ""A talk by Dr. Chomsky on the injustices from bloodthirsty Jews"". As she was saying this, the person she was with looked at my Star of David necklace and then proceeded to say something in Arabic to the woman I was speaking with. The woman then proceeded to loudly and angrily exclaim that I was ""venomous"" and a ""disgusting murderer"" to which others in line turned to us. I was so alarmed and taken aback that I quickly walked away. I even felt unsafe to walk back to my dorm alone later that evening. I do not know whether these people were MIT affiliated or not. I do not feel that students should be censored in their political beliefs. I feel censorship can create an environment that could be deemed unsafe to students. What I do believe, though, is that people should be weary of when their beliefs transform into hatred. I am not Israeli nor do I have a strong opinion on the situation, and I have not even been to Israel. Yet, due to my cultural and religious identity I was verbally attacked in front of many people. I have not been here for a full semester, yet I have already experienced this hatred. I feel unsafe to wear my Star of David necklace that I have been wearing for years let alone discuss this matter. We are all students- most is not all of whom have played no role in this conflict. All student groups should be tolerant of each other's beliefs even if there is disagreement. But no student should be subject to personal discrimination and no student should ever feel that their safety is threatened."

Hang on a minute, if this were a black cop shooting a white man, or a white cop shooting a white man, or a black cop shooting a black man, the facts would matter. But they don't matter if it's white on black aggression? I stopped the debate to tell her that I saw that as paternalistic racism. She looked down on black people, and saw that as a good thing. Thus we need a little extra help because we aren't good enough to measure up to white people. Regardless of the case, the facts matter, if the individuals involved happen to be a different race, it does not necessarily mean the incident was race based, unless you have evidence to prove so. She apologized and got horrified I saw that as racist. I explained to her that she meant no harm, and I'm not angry, that I just want the same assumptions about guilt and innocence as anyone else, and that you shouldn't assume either based on race."

5905,2015-11-09 09:56:54,"I am a female belonging to a minority race and I am honestly overwhelmed and confused by all the extremely emotional discussions and comments around racist or culturalist costumes over the past few days. It seems like anyone who suggests that they believe dressing as a culture that is not their own is ok in certain conditions (ie it's done respectfully) gets extremely toxic replies. 

To make it clear, I have been the victim of some pretty terrible racist/culturalist bullying. I come from a very unprivileged background. And those bigoted and close-minded people have hurt me very deeply. However, from my experiences at MIT Halloween parties/Spooky Skate/etc. over the past three years, I don't think that the majority of people who cross-cultural-dress are doing it maliciously. People who choose to do so usually have an appreciation and respect for what they portray. And even if they don't understand everything about the prejudices and difficulties that my people have suffered throughout the course of history, their intention is not to mock or humiliate.

I realize that this may be painting an overly optimistic picture. I have definitely seen offensive cultural costumes or references done for the sole purpose of humor. However, it seems as if the MIT Confessions community is using a too-wide brushstroke to paint all cross-cultural-dressers in a negative light.

I just wanted to say that I am a part of a minority group and that I will not be offended if someone not belonging to my race or culture dresses up (in a respectful way). There are many wonderful things about my heritage and culture that I celebrate and it makes me really happy to see other people learn and enjoy those things as well.

I may be missing something very important in my assessment of this whole situation. Maybe it really is extremely offensive to dress up as another race or culture, no matter how ""good"" your intention. If so, I honestly don't understand why. (And I have thought long and hard about this topic.) I openly welcome any comments/discussions if you have an opposing point of view."

Go to the police and the police only, immediately. The police can get the rapist put in jail where he belongs. If you go to the school, they will do everything possible to sweep it under the rug because they don't want the bad press. On top of that the most they can do is expel the guy, that's a dream come true for a rapist. No criminal charges. In fact, he could even drop out during the proceedings, the proceedings will not be completed, and then transfer to another school where the previous school cannot legally disclose his sexual assault investigation. I know it's scary to face the police, but the school is not here to look out for students, it's here to look out for itself."

5923,2015-11-09 09:10:27,"Okay, I have a serious question about transgender people. Say someone decides that they want to start identifying as the other gender. Doesn't that just mean that they identify with stereotypes corresponding to the other gender more? And so isn't that a contradiction to the feminist ideal of eliminating gender stereotypes?

I'm new to being vocal about this kind of thing, so I'm probably missing something. Thoughts?"

5925,2015-11-09 09:47:31,"I saw some graphic recently where it depicts a man touching a woman's hair and being like ""oh so soft"" and the woman thinking ""stop touching me."" I think this was meant to show something about gender interactions and men not respecting women's bodies, which I think is a totally valid point. The thing that made it weird for me is I've been in the exact same situation as the woman in the picture except I'm male. 
I also have had the experience of being unwillingly followed around and unwantedly touched and kissed by a girl I had absolutely no interest in and thought I had made this clear. I felt like I couldn't defend myself physically without being blamed and I felt really disrespected. I have pretty much succeeded in blocking this out to the point where I can't really say it has had an adverse effect on my longterm wellbeing.
However, what I'm trying to say is I feel uncomfortable when I see things that seem to indicate stuff like this only happens to women because I feel like it sort of denies my experience to only highlight interactions like this when the man is the oppressor and not the victim. At the same time, I understand that the scenario probably is (much?) more likely to occur with the offending party being male and I don't think it was intending to deny my experience.
So I just felt like getting this off my chest.
That said, to my fellow guys, make sure to respect women, and to the women reading this, make sure to respect us too."

5933,2015-11-07 15:59:51,"Begins rant:

As a black non-American male who can actually dance, [as confirmed by my awards from dancing competitions] lets say I am actually frustrated by the type of girls I meet on the dance floor at MIT and around the Boston area. (Am 21+) . In my experience, I have met two types of girls.

1) The white, asian [including Indians of course], or black girl who is insecure or probably lacks exposure and refuses to dance with any black male. I make this conclusion because I see them dancing with another  non-black male immediately after they turn down dancing with me. And repeat this disgusting behaviour throughout the party. I actually try to watch to see if I can prove myself wrong. Unfortunately, they prove me right every fucking time.

2)  The ones who understand that a party is just a party and are willing to dance with anyone who can prove that they got moves.

Now, if you belong to group two, clap for yourself. Those who belong to group one however, should check themselves or their prejudices. Do you prefer dancing with non-black males to black males? Why?...
Do you understand that this behaviour could have a racist undertone? If you act this way because of what the media perpetuates, check yourself. Relax and have fun. Parties are supposed to be fun and not a space to bring whatever racist tendencies you have. 

This post about discrimination also rings true for black women and online dating as well... but I won't delve into that for sake of brevity.

I feel like this part of the world is overly obsessed with unfounded assumptions about races to the point where communities at schools like MIT and other schools around the Boston area are so segmented. Lets chill and have fun people, We share more in common than our differences to be honest...

5934,2015-11-07 15:31:52,"As a man involved in the feminist movement I want to call out some hypocrisies I have personally witnessed. Certain feminists want equal rights but also want men to be expected to hold the door for them and pay for them on dates. That is not equality. If you really want equality then you don't get doors held for you by men for being a woman or meals paid for, you can't have it both ways."

Even though I was completely truthful, I feel like I selected parts of my life to misrepresent myself on my MIT application and I don't deserve to be here. Above all, I feel like I'm just using mental health as an excuse to be lazy."
5937,2015-11-07 15:34:57,"The privileging of solid over fluid mechanics, and indeed the inability of science to deal with turbulent flow at all, she attributes to the association of fluidity with femininity. Whereas men have sex organs that protrude and become rigid, women have openings that leak menstrual blood and vaginal fluids... From this perspective it is no wonder that science has not been able to arrive at a successful model for turbulence. The problem of turbulent flow cannot be solved because the conceptions of fluids (and of women) have been formulated so as necessarily to leave unarticulated remainders."

5947,2015-11-07 15:12:20,"One thing that is driving me crazy in this transgender debate is what a transgender woman is. I think it's medically dishonest to call that a woman. What it really comes down to is a transgender woman is a man who has been castrated with a mutilated penis, added estrogen, and possibly a couple other cosmetic procedures. He does not have ovaries, a uterus, natural breasts, female hip structure, cannot reproduce, in short does not medically qualify as a woman. You can't actually switch gender."

5984,2015-11-07 15:04:28,"MIT is a hard place, I'm not going to deny that. And yet I think that sometimes we get so caught up in the difficulties that we encounter here that we lose sight of the positive aspects. I don't just mean the job opportunities or degrees that we earn, or all of the amazing people that we get to meet. I mean the belief that it can give us in ourselves. 

I've doubted myself and my abilities my entire life despite the fact that I've generally been pretty good at most things that I've tried. All throughout high school, I was afraid to take on challenges, and I was afraid to believe in myself, because I thought that I wasn't good enough. Then I came to MIT. I had always heard about how it could beat you down, about how if you were once at the top of your class, you would find yourself struggling to stay in the middle of the pack. When I started on my first day, I was terrified.

But something weird happened--I didn't fail. For the first time in my life, I allowed myself to take on a challenge that I truly believed I wouldn't be able to handle. And instead of crashing and burning, I did well. I got A's and joined clubs and picked up hobbies. I made friends and became more social. I learned that even though MIT was hard, I could handle it. And that's been one of the most rewarding experiences in my life.

I know that MIT can be incredibly difficult. I've spent just as many nights as the next person sacrificing sleep for the two midterms and three psets due the next day. I've gone through entire classes not knowing what the hell was going on. And I know that I am lucky that I have been able to handle it.

Not everyone will have a story like mine. Many people will learn what it is like to fail, and some people may not make it through all four years to be able to say that in the end, MIT was worth it. 

I guess that all I wanted to say in this post was something positive about MIT. It gets a lot of shit. It's easy to point out its faults, and it's easy to complain about the stress and the workload. It punishes a lot of people, and I don't want to minimize their struggle. It's not a place that will benefit everyone. 

But on behalf of those of us that it does, I'd like to thank MIT. It's been a rough ride. But for me, without a doubt, it's been worth it."

5988,2015-11-07 15:10:35,"I love MIT. The workload and nagging feeling of incompetence gets rough sometimes, yes, but if that's the price I have to pay to learn all that I'm learning (inside & outside the classroom) and to form all the relationships I'm forming, then I'm happy to pay it. I love my friends, I love my boyfriend (perhaps soon my fiancé), I love my department and its faculty and staff. I love Boston and Cambridge, I love my dorm, and I especially love my living group. I got so lucky.

Everyone's experience is different, I know. It pains me that so many people posting on MITConfessions are having such a hard time, and haven't found that happiness that I've found. I won't pretend to know the panacea for that, but I do know that if you're continually miserable here, then something needs to change. Change dorms, change majors, change friends, change perspective. If something isn't working, you change it. Reach out to someone (which, yes, is terrifying) and talk. I sincerely believe that most people here will want to help you make that change and find your happiness. I wish the best for all of you.

As a senior, I've seen MIT at its worst, when morale dips low and the administration is stagnant. I've also seen MIT at its best, when the students are lit up with the creative energy that got them here and are excited about innovation, about making the world better, safer, cooler, happier, and when MIT uses its vast resources to enable us to put our ideas into action. When students support each other through thick and thin, when professors go that extra mile to answer panicked pset questions at 3 AM, when TAs and staff and Housemasters go above and beyond to make sure you're doing okay, that you have the resources you need -- that is MIT at its best. I wish everyone could feel it."

6022,2015-11-02 23:09:50,"I think I might be the worst MIT student ever to make it to senior year. I've never had a job, internship, externship, or UROP. I'm not in any clubs. I haven't done well, nor am I currently doing well, in many of my classes. My advisor probably thinks I'm a piece of shit. I think I'm a piece of shit. I think I’m a dumb, ugly, unmotivated, boring, socially awkward dysfunctional piece of shit. That’s what goes through my head, constantly.

I have issues... my biggest one is that I'm AFRAID of people. Paralyzingly afraid of people. Always worried about what people think of me, always fearing I’m being watched and judged in public. I have a huge social anxiety problem. And it's cause I hate myself and have no confidence. It’s probably why I never reach out to people for new friends or jobs.

I’m tired of spending entire weekends in my room, only going out for bathroom breaks and to get dinner in a green box. I’m tired of spending hours on a pset failing to make any real progress. I’m tired of struggling in office hours, hearing people say they get it and it all makes sense now when I’m still confused, probably on a problem before the one they just got. I’m tired of not being able to get help when I feel this way because I can’t talk properly to whoever comes to help me, in excruciating discomfort and fear that they and whoever else is overhearing will probably think I’m a dumbass.

I’ll never deliberately kill myself. I’m too scared of the possibility of hell, and I don’t want to put my family through the grief. But I feel trapped in my inhibitions. I have to change something. But I’m not going to S^3 or mental health to do it, cause that’s more people, and they’ll probably just kick me out. Sorry to add another sad confession on here."
6023,2015-11-02 23:42:51,MIT has 10/10 mental health services. It's funny how friends tell me that MIT has 'a lot of services' concerning depression when in reality it's all a lame excuse to cover up the high suicide rate. It took a lot of wasted willpower to go to MIT Medic to just encounter this mediocre secretary who's paid too little to even give me a smile. Im told I need to wait for a call to set up an appointment for who knows when. I mean what do I need to do to get their attention? Aren't they supposed to be the ones to help me? I guess I'm not that important here. MIT itself is getting a warehouse full of disposable students if you haven't heard.

Just walking around on Halloween night made me sick, as does reading some confessions with comments on getting shitfaced.  Really? Is that all you guys think about?  Is that all you aspire to?  You all may be good at academics, but you are all still just spoiled brats, who live in a fantasy world, where there are no consequences and someone else cleans up your messes.

Imitation is the highest form of flattery. This guy made it clear he did not care for reason and argued his great great grandmother was Cherokee and I was a racist in his eyes. I pointed out that he looked white to me and I doubted the Cherokee would recognize him as one of their own. He then went with the I'm offended and can't keep my mouth shut argument. So then I got nasty, I pointed out that the Cherokees lost to the rest of us, the only ones with honor choose to die fighting, the ones still alive were the cowards who choose to surrender and loose their land and bodies, so he had no pride to take in his Cherokee ancestry. He then stormed away in rage. If you want to start a fight with me over a stupid Halloween costume, prepare to lose."

The statements, which in my opinion, are objective facts about features and behavior types of certain racial groups, seem to be considered racist in the US. Like, admitting the fact that the volume of noise of Chocolate House people is intimidating to me as a person from a quieter culture is a racist statement. Admitting the fact that racial proportion at MIT is an outcome of a fair competition based on SAT scores and other objective criteria and hence concluding that certain groups should just merely study harder is racist. Admitting the fact that yes, walking home too late at night (2am), I feel more scared about one racial group representative compared to another, just based on MIT criminal bulletin announcements racial stats is racist. 
WTF? 

I come from a country with multiple ethnicities with significant differences between each other. Acknowledgment these differences publicly in the form statements above and jokes is OK, since people there seem to have objectivity sense and sense of humor. This calm attitude seems to be based on the fact that no ethnic group feels endangered and hence takes these statements/jokes seriously. Wonder why here there is so much reaction here."

On a vaguely unrelated note, I found myself at an interesting thought regarding this whole discussion. Liberals (read: most everyone commenting around here) tend to support religion much less than conservatives, but both groups essentially do the same thing! Conservatives place their faith in an unprovable phantom being, allowing them a vent for things going wrong and events they can't handle without a safety net fantasy. Liberals do the same thing, but they project their own insecurity onto the myth of ""the goodness of mankind"" and pseudo-""morality."""

But I've also seen people absolutely love the things they are doing. And get excited about classes, UROPs, or clubs/sports. Everyone goes through a bit of a struggle (some more than others). But to overarchingly say that MIT is ""hopeless,"" has ""extra bullshit,"" or is a ""living hell"" is a bit exaggerated. I really do believe the administration cares about us and are trying really hard to make sure we are taken care of. Some people have bad experiences. Yes, it isn't perfect. But no place is perfect.

A lot of people are rightly worried about police officers in school with children. The reason so many schools do it is that lawsuit threats make it very difficult for them to enforce discipline. Any wrong gesture or accidental mark left while physically dragging a disruptive student away could lead to criminal charges for the teacher and the school. Police officers are trained how to do this properly, have experience, and can do it with minimal legal threat. If you really want to get police officers out of schools support tort reform so teachers can safely grab students who are fighting or being wildly disruptive in class."

6119,2015-10-29 13:54:10,"After being at MiT for a couple of years I've had a lot experiences that have redefined my self-identity as an academic and a person. We've all struggled here-okay *most* of us for one reason or another. We've all questioned ourselves and the Institute for what it *claims* to offer.

For me personally, I've constantly struggled here. My freshman year I chalked it up to not having a strong technical background. I didn't take AP Chem or higher level biology and those were the classes I got my fifth week flags in. As I was getting adjusted to just how rigorous (read: how absolutely fucking ridiculous) MiT work can be, sophomore year came. Once again I was flogged by work. Now in my major I chalked up to never seeing the material before, but sophomore year I realized, just like most people realize sophomore year, that something is up. MIT
may be ranked one of the greatest schools in the world but you wouldn't be able to tell that by the quality of the teaching. 

See, every homework assignment I've EVER gotten at MiT. I've had to google, I had to Wikipedia, I had to Internet. Every assignment required me to learn what ought to have been taught in class. The problems were never really elucidated by lecture. They just show where the hole is, and the homework throws you in. 
After a few years here I've gotten tired of it. When I see professors say ""you'll learn through the Pset"" I realize that's often a poor guise to cover their poor teaching. And as much as people may learn from really hard problems only loosely connected to the lecture, I don't. Relying on excessively hard problems to most of the value to your education is one size fits all solutions that fails to take into account people's differing learning styles or the fulfillment of the undergraduate experience. I learn from teachers. Not problems. Even if I did, with the constant rush to the next assignment or the next problem you don't have the time to dissect a problem for its moral of the story. Let's be honest, you  don't even have time to sleep here. 

Now say what you will about MiT needing to be ""rigorous"" or hard, but in reality, I've spent years here just googling. Now googling Isn't inherently a bad thing , but when I find other universities with far better notes and lectures than MiT-constantly-I have my doubts about the Institute. 
I have my doubts when I see all of us struggling to get by, when I see suicide after suicide, and realize we are some of the smartest people in the world. Yet, collectively we struggle here. Yes, we came here for a challenge and yes struggling is a great way to grow, but clearly the struggle here is an order of magnitude off.

Great researchers don't always make for great teachers. And yes, the idea of having the best in the world teach you sounds great...but I realize being taught by the best *teachers* in the world would be a helluva lot better.

I'm just writing this because I feel others can relate and this sentiment should be voiced

I do not doubt the validity of these stories, but I feel like it paints an unrepresentative picture of the professors as a whole. I, personally, have had positive experiences with many professors that I've had and truly felt like many have cared about my own academic success. Not all are as caring as some are, but many have gone through exams with me after I have done poorly to identify what my weak spots were and what strategies I could employ to do better in the future. Most have been accommodating when I miss class for interviews or athletics. When I have been ill or physically injured, and I go to S^3, they have been generous with extending deadlines, pushing off exams, and even sometimes excusing exams when I have been concussed. They are not always 100% accommodating, but in my own personal experiences, they have been pretty reasonable most of the time. I think that there are definitely exceptions, but overall, they're not that bad."

A) we aren't psychologists. 
B) is suicide inherently wrong/bad? 
The desire to stop people from committing suicide comes from a self-serving desire to avoid the guilt and discomfort of someone you know being unhappy. Some people will argue ""I don't even know them!"", but tell the truth. If they hadn't explicitly said they were contemplating, you wouldn't have tried to talk them out of it. Suicide is death. It's not bad or good. It's a choice that is made by people who don't have anything they think is worth living for. Why stop them? Why force them to be uncomfortable just so you're not?"

6147,2015-10-27 20:14:57,"I totally feel hopeless these days. Why does this world just give undergrads so, so, so, so, so little tolerance to make mistakes?
I feel we need to be nearly perfect in such a competitive world to survive, everyone around me are all way too talented with either a 4.9 or 5.0 GPA. I am so confused. Isn't undergrad education suppose to provide us with opportunities to explore and try different things, and to learn through mistakes? I don't know when. When? The situation has changed as if we need to be perfect. Nearly perfect, 4.7+ GPA, decent research experience, probably publishing papers as an undergrad, and recommendation letters, and working experiences, and language ability.......I feel it's impossible for me to survive here. Why? Why is this world so stringent to undergrads, to people who just start their 20s? Why aren't they not allowed to make mistakes? Conversely, you need to excel all the classes, get only 2 or 3 Bs, and function as a grad student in labs, in order to get into grad schools. Why? Why is the world so tough?

I am entirely miserable about my current situation, probably I am just a useless person that doesn't deserve to appear here, or even this way too competitive world. I don't understand. I actually enjoy most of the classes I am taking. Although most of them are demanding, requiring heavy readings-several papers or hundreds of pages of literature in advance, I feel I learn a lot. I also learn a lot in class and do my best on assignments. Occasionally, things just turn out to be imperfect. I got a score close to average on a midterm, and then suffered from nightmares that I could get a B on that class, which is a CIM with 18 credits that will totally make my GPA collapse. I can hardly sleep and eat well these days. I also got points off on daily homeworks, but I am so confused. Why? I have made my most effort to study and do the assignments, they just can't be perfect, perfect in a way that meet some specific, abstract given ""key worlds"". And the class is just graded in such a stupid way. You have to be exceptional to get an A. You have to be brilliant to get an A. You have to be ""more excellent"" to get an A. Why? I don't understand. Why are instructors in MIT always so reluctant to give As as if they had to pay for each given A? In my classes, everyone, or at least 90% of people work very hard on presentations, labs and reports. What's the point then to choose the top 1/3 of them to give As? Why do you need to be 10 points higher than average each time in order to get A? Not even one failure is allowed, otherwise you fuck up, collapse, and lose. I don't know why. I actually like the classes. I learn a lot. I like the professors. I just can't agree with this whole world. Fuck the world. The world makes me to do so. But I have to pretend as if I could power through every class, even afraid to post in my native language here lest being recognized. Fuck myself. Fuck this world."

I don't want to lose either of their friendships, and so instead I pretend like everything's okay. But I can't stop thinking about how I missed my chance. It actually feels like its too late. I always thought that when he figured his shit out and so did I, there was a chance we could be together, and have something pretty fucking awesome.

6181,2015-10-26 20:46:13,"A lot of people here were their high school's valedictorian and now they come to a place like MIT and realize that they are no longer the best - they may be below average or maybe even average.  And this makes them feel awful but their friends tell them ""you are below average at a top university - you are still above average in a grand sense.""  I also see this ALL the time in comments on this page.

While this *may* be true (I don't 100% believe that, after all STEM !> humanities), it just seems to be a super weird thing to say.  Why is your ""confidence"" based on being better than other people?  Sometimes it is super annoying to work with another MIT student at a company because they often look their noses down at kids from other colleges and they refuse to learn from them.  Like stop.  Stop getting your self worth from being better than other people.  Sometimes you aren't the best.  And that's okay.

I have an older sister who is a freaking prodigy so I had to learn this lesson super young.  I would sometimes say, ""she is really, really smart - she gets things faster than me.""  And my friends and parents would be so concerned about my self-esteem when I said that.  I later had to explain to them that just because I knew I wasn't better at her at school or at music than her didn't mean I wasn't confident in myself.  A lot of people at my high school didn't see it that way.  They thought the way a lot of you guys think - they got their self-worth from being the best.  And they saw her as a threat.  They told her everyday that she was stupid and basically bullied her.  My sister to this day doesn't realize how smart she is, how she has the freaking Midas Touch all because a few self-conscious people couldn't stand the thought of not being the best.

So how do I get my confidence?  From the knowledge that everyday I am here, I get better than I was yesterday and I test *my* limits.  And my only competition is myself."

In this instance, the train by default goes straight. Changing the track makes him responsible for the single death, and therefore a murderer. Is he responsible for the five deaths if he does nothing? If yes, then he is responsible for all deaths you could prevent but do nothing about. If not, he has no obligation to pull it.

I think most here would say you should pull the lever. However, if you aren't trying to save as many lives as you can every second of every day when you have the possibility to save them, then you are in some sense responsible for all of those lives. Ignorance of how you can save someone is not an excuse, since you can always use time when you can't save someone to gather more information so that you can.

I'm on the side where I think we should try to save as many people as possible. I also know that I'm not doing as much as I can to save people. Doing this burdens me with extreme guilt, because I recognize that I'm responsible for a large number of deaths. I completely understand and respect why someone wouldn't want to deal with the guilt of blood on their hands.

The biggest difference is that at other universities you don't get shat on with work that assumes near perfect understanding of lectures."

But nobody points out that we can pass all the laws we want, even though there are roughly 325 million guns in the civilian population. If we want truly effective gun control we have to begin massive confiscation of those firearms. Particularly hand guns, since they are the usual murder weapon of choice. This will be tough and involve some sacrifice. We should quit talking about background checks and instead figure out who has guns, and how we can effectively use the local police, national guard, and military to confiscate them. We must stand against the NRA in one loud clear voice and say that our right to live without fear trumps your right to have stupid metal toys."

6201,2015-10-26 20:05:41,"Once upon a pset, I was poring over my own graphite scrawl to find the error, which despite my endless labors had persisted somewhere between the top of page two and the middle of page five, the error, taunting, cackling at my ineptitude, scarecely able to stifle its schadenfreude, tucked away in some subscript, obscure yet plainly there, somewhere, faintly snickering, somewhere, somewhere, when abruptly and quietly nature cast a solitary ray of light, when nature, ever cruelly indifferent to misery and mirth, deigned to arrange a trifling gust to separate two tree leaves outside my window for long enough that a sunbeam could briefly alight on the errant minus sign, as if bidding me to shuffle the symbols once again, bidding me to straighten my wayward rows of curlicues, bidding me to understand the laws they so feebly stood for, those laws by which that selfsame sunbeam made its journey to this lonely earth and my meek desk, bidding me to feel and know the laws unceasingly unfolding, for just a fleeting moment."
6202,2015-10-26 20:47:50,"Having been here for a while, I feel as though MIT can be a pretty isolating place. Whether this manifests itself in the form of a small unchanging friend group or spending most hours alone, it seems fairly easy to fall out of touch with the MIT community at large. Maybe I'm out on a limb here, but it seems as though it's mostly through online avenues, like MIT confessions, and at the few class-wide events that some people, like me, are reminded of the fact that 4000+ other undergrads are going through the same experience, with its mix of highs and lows. A decent number of high schools where I am from used to have weekly assemblies of the student body. At the time, I took these for granted but in hindsight, it was nice and almost therapeutic to have a chance to talk to people whom I otherwise wouldn't have had an excuse to interact with. While it's college and I'm guessing people don't want to have ""assemblies"", it would be nice if there were more campus-wide events. Maybe a free food event in Lobby 10 every month open to all undergraduates? Maybe other people feel similarly and have better suggestions. I recognize that confessions is probably not the best place to propose something like this... yeah, sorry about that."

6208,2015-10-26 20:17:59,"I've probably met 100s of ppl here now and am still yet to meet even one who isn't amazing in some way. And yet for a place with the most amazing people I've ever met, this place does a helluva impressive job of making literally everyone feel the exact opposite way. Here's why, and this next part is going to sound rough, but I hope you read on beyond for my explanation: The fact is that I do consider some people to be more amazing than others, I mean that's only natural. That doesn't change the fact that everyone I've met here is amazing, but simply reflects the fact that we all have our own ideas of amazing. For example, the most amazing person that I know based on my standards of amazing is someone who always seems insecure/scared/inadequate for not having the best scores/stats/accomplishments but never fails to check in on a friend, which is a trait which I consider important enough to make them my most amazing. Similarly I've heard ppl consider someone who's gotten '200 top company job offers' (Clarification: That's intentional exaggeration) to be the most amazing. The point is that we are all so amazing that I guarantee that someone out there considers us to be their most amazing friend/acquaintance. Yet we are also so competitive, hell, we needed to be to get here, that we drown out that voice that considers us amazing and hear all the voices that consider us well, at worst, less amazing. Remember this quote:

""You are the most amazing person I've ever had the privilege of meeting"" -Someone, perhaps your best friend, your significant other, or someone you'll meet in the future, but I have no doubt someone has or will think this about you, and listen to them cause they're the ones who are actually right. I mean they're calling you the best person out of 7.1 billion people, which means you're pretty fucking amazing."

6252,2015-10-25 17:11:26,"As many supporters of the ""prejudice plus power"" definition say, the definitions of words are not dependent on what official dictionaries say. While they're correct that conflicting with common usage or a dictionary definition is not enough to discredit a definition, there also needs to be a legitimate and necessary reason to change a definition, like if that definition is ineffective or limiting. However, this is not the case. Under the original definition, there are already terms that illustrate the concept of ""prejudice plus power"" (institutional racism, structural racism, systemic racism, racist oppression, etc.). Under this definition, white Americans are still not racially oppressed, and those people who complain about how bad ""reverse racism"" is are still wrong.

Redefining racism as ""power plus prejudice"" is not only unnecessary, but is also problematic. Here's a thought experiment. Two distinct racial groups live in adjacent countries. Each side regards the other as racially inferior degenerates who deserve to be either subjugated or exterminated. The two are at constant war with each other, but as they are roughly equally matched, neither side has succeeded in subduing the other. Are the two countries not racist? The mutual race hatred here seems like the kind of situation that the concept of “racism” is tailor-made to describe. But while each side seeks domination, neither has it. There’s no inequality, no privilege, no oppression.

Another example is the Qing Dynasty of China. The Qing Dynasty was set up by Manchus who invaded the preceding Ming Dynasty. The Manchus politically enjoyed many privileges as a result of being the ruling class and social ones, like the imposition of their cultural custom of the queue. However, Chinese civilization has something called sinicization. Since China is so large, any invaders must inevitably adopt ""Chinese"" customs. Manchu elites were thus under constant pressure to appear Chinese lest they invoke the wrath of Han chauvinism, which basically translated into imitating and appeasing the Han, since being the majority they exemplified what it meant to be ""Chinese."" Thus, you had a strange power dynamic where the Manchus and the Han both simultaneously possessed privilege. As one can see, the ""prejudice plus power"" definition is unable to properly describe this situation.
In a more explicit example of anti-Manchu racism, there was also an entire massacre of Manchus in Xi'an by Han. Under prejudice plus power, it would be unclear if this was racism despite it being literally an act of genocide. The ""prejudice plus power"" definition's erasure of foreign racial dynamics like this that are more complex than current social relations in the West honestly reeks of Americentrism and Western-centrism."

6268,2015-10-24 16:24:59,"I find it significantly easier to make friends online than it is to make friends in person. As someone who actually cannot talk to people unless someone else talks to me first (and even then, it's difficult for me to carry on conversations), getting to someone anonymously through some text on a screen feels like a great way to start until we get closer and actually become friends. But because I have so many online friends, I feel complacent knowing I have people to talk to, but I also feel incredibly lonely because I don't really have any friends here. It's really hard to integrate into friend groups when everyone is already happy with their friends and don't need another awkward late addition to their group. And even then, I still feel like an outsider when I try. Somedays when I'm lying alone in my room talking to online friends, I really just wish I had someone nearby, a physical shoulder to cry on, or even being silent and just knowing that someone here knows I exist would be appreciated. I'm afraid I could die alone in my room someday and no one would know, and no one would care."

6307,2015-10-23 20:33:20,"I had the best argument to have with people you just met. I was introduced at dinner to a friend of a friend. And this guy went on and on about humans effect on the planet and how every person excreted x kilos of CO2 a day hurting the planet, and how we were pushing earth, making us sound like a disease. So I asked him if he thought most humans were harming the planet by breeding and using resources. He delightedly said yes. I asked him if earth would be better without us. Eagerly, he also said yes. Then I slid him a knife from the other side of the table. I told him, ""Since we are all hunks of trash hurting this planet, that includes you, since you are so passionate, lead us by example, by committing suicide right now and saving the planet from your harmful effects"". He stammered at me baffled by the thought. I then let him in on the truth. People like him who go on about how humans are so bad for the planet think they are better then everyone else. They want other people to have to make sacrifices, not themselves. Needless to say he left dinner. I can be a little rough with new people."

People don't seem to value hard work anymore. They either believe that working hard should lead to unconditional success, or they believe that one shouldn't have to work hard to get a fair lot in life. This page is a great example. Everyone is whining about work and stress and homework and problem sets and classes that no one is forcing you to attend. Go get a job at the 7/11 down the street if you think it sucks so much.

You don't deserve anything intrinsically, except maybe the right to exist."

This girl reached into my pants and started giving me a handjob. At that moment I had to make a decision: tell her to stop so we could escape, or let her continue and face death. I chose the latter. However, after death I was revived to moments before the werewolf attacked us facing the exact same decision. Every time I died I was revived and had to make the same decision over and over again. I forever chose the handjob over survival until I finally woke up."

I feel like I try so hard to be a good student and to prove to myself that I'm smart and capable, but it's so hard to convince myself when I fail almost every test I take. I've come to like myself in most other ways, but I lack confidence in my own intelligence and it's really affecting my overall well-being. I feel like as a junior I should have these things under control by now, but I don't and I don't know how."

6357,2015-10-23 20:24:57,"Coming into MIT as a freshman, I was cynical and bitter, and all the upperclassmen thought there was something wrong with me.  But MIT made me better because it was finally a place I had people who didn't hate my company.  I finally had solid friend group I could rely on.

Nowadays, I find myself feeling that I'm that friend that nobody likes but no one is willing to confront.  I can't help but wonder if I would be happier if people were willing to tell me they dislike me to my face.  I get that they're being nice, but the fake and teeth-clenched kindness sucks too."

6367,2015-10-21 11:54:20,"Alright, here's the thing, people. Bernie Sanders is not actually a socialist. Socialism is defined as a socioeconomic system in which the means of production are socially owned. Thus, a socialist advocates for the transformation of the preexisting economy into one in which the workers collectively and democratically manage their own workplaces, instead of one dominated by privately-owned businesses. 

What Sanders identifies as, a reformist democratic socialist, refers to someone who seeks to achieve that goal through reforms within the existing political system. But he only seeks to through reform make capitalism more regulated, not with any ultimate goal of abolishing capitalism itself. 

Thus, Bernie Sanders is not actually a democratic socialist, but a social democrat. The Scandinavian countries he talks about are also social democratic, not socialist. Social democracy is a capitalist ideology that advocates for a more regulated economy and government intervention in social welfare, and it is not socialism."
6368,2015-10-21 11:45:21,"I want to take a moment to defend Sanders from some of the haters here. They keep asking, how can we pay for the all the infrastructure spending without raising middle class taxes? Fair question, it doesn't mean Sanders hasn't thought it through. It's simple, we borrow more money. The U.S government is not a business, we have no borrowing limits. And the best part is, since we are the superpower of the world, we can borrow from other nations non stop and if we can't make the payments, we just tell them to take a hike and default. They can't come seize our assets or do anything, they just have to take a loss. That's their problem, not ours. Then we just borrow more at a higher interest rate and more to pay the higher interest, wash, rinse, repeat."
6369,2015-10-21 11:35:22,"There was someone below who posted that he isn't sure if global warming is real or not. To you I say you are asking the wrong question. It no longer matters if global warming is real or not. Everyone thinks its real. I admittedly am not sure myself. But I no longer bother to even ask. If people believe it to be true, they will act in a manner of prevention, so long as they have to make little or no personal sacrifice along the way. So ask yourself, how can I use this to my advantage?"
6370,2015-10-21 11:26:24,"I ended up as an odd third wheel in an Obamacare debate the other day. One guy said we should repeal it, the other said it's fine. What neither said pointed out was that both their ideas suck. What I think we ought to do as a nation is address the fundamental causes of sky high health care prices which no plan addresses. For example, you cannot import drugs from other countries. You can get them so cheaply elsewhere, but it's illegal to get them here. Another problem is buying insurance. You can't buy across state lines. So each state insurer gets their own monopoly and doesn't have to compete. Democrats say the old system was capitalism out of control, Republicans say the new system is socialism out of control. It's crony-ism out of control. If we address these fundamental flaws, insurance will be irrelevant."

The replies I got when I got in touch with S^3 and my four professors telling them when I would finish my work? 1) Drop my class, 2) I'm giving you a zero on the exam you missed and you should drop my class, 3) I'm giving you a zero on the exam you missed, 4) silence. S^3 is being less than helpful right now. This is super frustrating and isolating and is not helped by my depression/anxiety.

I'm lucky because I have a great support network of friends, but it's strange that this community always seems confused and surprised when there's a suicide. Sometimes the only thing keeping me from that is a friend who happened to check in at the right time, and I know I'm not the only one. This was already an issue, but callous profs aren't helping."

6392,2015-10-21 11:11:14,This school is a pressure cooker. It makes even really stable people unstable.
6393,2015-10-21 11:01:15,"I'm really starting to get irritated by how hard the institute has been pubbing the Apple events on campus this week. I've gotten over a dozen emails from various groups advertising the same events, and it just reinforces the whole stereotype of how circle-jerky Apple fans are. Yes, their design is marvelous, and yes they're coming to campus, but I don't see why Apple should get so much more publicity than any other company of equivalent caliber that comes to MIT's campus."
6394,2015-10-21 11:47:16,"I have some friends that are fucking smart. You think I'm just being a typical MIT student. No. I'm talking about International Olympiad Medalist smart. They breeze through all the classes I struggle in and then brush it off like its nothing. They are all so wonderful and amazing, but they give me a complex like none other. I can only dream of being as smart as them but I feel like I've hit this barrier. What I get done in 5 hours, they get done in 1. And yeah you can say all the bullshit about how it doesn't matter how accomplished or smart you are and how no one really cares after MIT, but I can't help but compare, especially as it is right there in my face. I know that any success or failure is my own fault and being bitter about how fucking dumb I am is immature, but I can't help it. Sometimes after staying up late to finish a pset they've already finished 4 hours earlier, I just feel so disgusted with myself. And I know that there's all these study techniques and all these resources available, but really, how much does that help? And I am getting help from my friends, but I just ask them so many questions I'm just frustrated with how dumb I am, regardless of whether or not my friends care. They don't, they're so willing to help it makes me even more angry with how incompetent I am. I'm just a burden, and I don't know what to do with my life, and fuck I'm just a huge fuck-up. Do I even have friends or are they just being nice to me?"
6395,2015-10-21 11:28:17,I fucking hate DOTA. Fuck DOTA. Fuck that video game.

6397,2015-10-19 17:36:20,"I have insomnia and I've been smoking weed at night so I can actually fall asleep. I've tried taking regular sleeping pills and bunch of others that my therapist prescribed to me. But either they are too strong and leave me super drowsy the next day or they are too weak and doesn't make me fall asleep. Weed has been so far the only thing that's been reliably working AND doesn't make me drowsy the next day. I'm not sure if I'll get in trouble telling that to a medical personnel so I've been lying about smoking. But nowadays my weed dealer has been really finicky and has been postponing delivering it to me. I'm already out of weed and been unable to fall asleep at a decent hour for the past couple days. I only know that one weed dealer and I'm not sure where else I can get weed. I thought about trying to get a medical marijuana certification, but I don't know if insomnia/depression/anxiety issue is enough of a ""problem"" to get the certification. Also I don't know how much more expensive it'll be to go through that process especially since the only legal weed dispensary in MA is far from campus... UGGGGHHHH"
6398,2015-10-19 16:55:21,i've figured it out. the tech shuttle runs on MIT time.
6399,2015-10-19 16:45:22,Is it ironic that I never have time to fill out the weekly EECS workload survey?
6400,2015-10-19 16:33:24,"One day I want to get married to my amazing boyfriend.  

But I can barely wear my brass rat once a week and marriage means wearing TWO rings every day for the rest of your life.  My finger would sweat all the time and I definitely would loose them a few times."
6401,2015-10-19 16:21:25,I find that my depression and anxiety always get so much worse at MIT. What does that say about me and whether I deserve to be here? Sometimes I really wonder if I made the wrong choice in coming to this school.
6402,2015-10-19 16:11:26,I googled 'most suicidal college' and MIT was 3 of the top 10 results.

6404,2015-10-19 16:54:28,i definitely prefer hour long blowjobs over sex
6405,2015-10-19 16:45:31,I hate when people think the November rule is a real thing and actually call people out for it; we're all adults here I feel like we can make decisions
6406,2015-10-19 16:35:32,Everyone deserves to experience walking the bridge to Classic Man. Feels lit AF walking into the Infinite knowing you're about to carpe the shit out of that diem.

6408,2015-10-19 16:15:35,"I have a lot of friends here who want to see this country become a western European style socialist nation. They think it will solve all of our problems. I actually think it won't. The problem is those European nations are very homogeneous. The people are mostly the same race, ethnicity, religion, culture, language, etc, etc. That's how they achieve such mass social agreement. America is a massive melting pot of every culture mashed together under a few basic principles. That's why it's so hard to get anything done politically here. I feel that if we went European socialist, people here would go back to outright racism, classicism, xenophobia, homophobia, anti-antisemitism as seen in much of Europe where immigrants try to move in. When we are all dependent on each other for a living, we fear outsiders and differences."
6409,2015-10-19 16:02:38,"I'm not sure if global warming is man made or a natural cycle or both. And it really bothers me. The more I read into the research, the less clear it becomes."

6418,2015-10-18 15:30:59,"All my friends think I'm a standard straight guy, but I have a secret.

Little do they know I have a comically large horse dildo that's over a foot long and 2 1/2 inches wide.  It looks fucking awesome and sometimes I prop it up and look/laugh/admire it while I work on PSets.

Wish there was someone I knew who could appreciate this magnificent piece of art."
6419,2015-10-18 15:20:10,"I'm a senior who's recently moved into a new dorm and all of my new friends here are strongly encouraging me to dye my hair (like, pink and green kind of dye), but I don't really know if it's a good idea. I have a bunch of job interviews coming up, and I'm worried that if I dye my hair like that it could hurt my chances. I've asked around here but I think the people in my dorm might be biased. Is it seen as less professional/could it hurt my chances if I had my hair dyed say, bright pink and green?"

It's my third year here and I still feel this way. *gasp* :( I wonder if it would have been better for society/world if someone else had been in my place, and been able to accomplish more than I have."

I just want to berate them for stupidity, especially when I see the same person do it more than once"
6438,2015-10-18 15:25:35,"When more than half the questions on Piazza are about quirks of the submission website, rather than the pset itself, you might want to rethink your submission website.

...looking at you, 6.006."
6439,2015-10-18 15:15:38,"At the end of the week, I am absolutely overworked and sleep deprived. Then I realized: It's pretty awesome to be overworked from MIT work. It's pure satisfaction."
6440,2015-10-18 15:06:39,"I'm at a point in my life where I really want to (not need to) be in a relationship. I know we're all smart here at MIT, but I want to find the deep-smart guys. Where are they?"
6441,2015-10-18 15:56:41,"I'm attracted to guys who are socially awkward. Don't know why, but I find them so adorable."
6442,2015-10-18 15:46:50,"Why would anyone ever want to drink from a firehose? Seriously, if you're thirsty and a drinking fountain isn't enough, you need a water bottle or like, a gallon of water, and you can take it at your own pace! Or a regular hose! Getting blasted by a firehose sucks and is bad for you, and the big reward at the end is that you can get a job where they regularly blast you with a firehose. I don't get it; doesn't anyone here just want a pleasant life?"
6443,2015-10-18 15:25:51,"I feel really lonely. I have met a lot of people over the years but I feel like none of them are my friends.

6446,2015-10-16 13:45:55,"I lack social skills. But I still fit in pretty well. All I need is an arsenal of conversation starters involving shitty professors, psets, and upcoming exams."

6448,2015-10-16 13:18:59,"I really feel like I understand MIT and belong there and that is why I come to this page and obsess over how it feels to be there.

6452,2015-10-16 13:07:14,We hooked up once. It was less like a hookup and more like we were waiting all those years to make this beautiful love. But actually it meant nothing to him but I'm not over it and I have to see him every day. Or it meant something and he isn't allowed to admit it. Impossible.

6455,2015-10-16 13:15:17,I miss my dog more than any of my family. It is unfair that MIT dorms allow cats yet not dogs. Either allow both or neither!

6457,2015-10-16 13:13:20,"I am a sophomore at MIT now. People told me all last year it takes about a year to integrate and get friends and all that, but it's been a year and a half for me and I'm still friendless. I see everyone else walking in to class in groups laughing and talking while I just sit there alone like the loner I am. I just don't know how to make friends, and I honestly need some. I don't think I can continue on like this much longer"

But if you decide to go in drag or get the surgery, please stop complaining about the stares and teasing. People are going to do it, they're people. It's human instinct to fear and retaliate against differences. Conformity has its group purposes."
6462,2015-10-16 13:11:26,"I live in Senior House, and I feel an odd kinship with the new AD. Perhaps we're both ostracized in a pretty interesting place where it's easy to feel hated, a place where being different from the prescribed ""different"" is ironically negative."

6473,2015-10-15 11:57:51,"Last semester I had crippling depression and anxiety. I cried anytime I was in class, and I cried at night on the days I did skip class. I almost cut myself a few times, but in one of my saner moments I gave my knife away. I talked to a few of my friends about it, but I feel so bad for all my other friends that I lied to. All of the ""stomachaches"" and ""colds"" I made up when they ask me if I had gone to class. I want to tell them so badly, to apologize; but I just can't. I'm so afraid of what they would think of me, eve though I know what what they would say, that it wasn't my fault and they don't blame me. I do though, I blame myself. I'm guilty."

6481,2015-10-15 11:27:13,Sometimes I ask my good friends to slap me across the face. I don't know there is something sexually satisfying about it
6482,2015-10-15 11:17:14,how did some of you make it to MIT without learning how not to piss on the toilet seat
6483,2015-10-15 11:59:15,When you have more than 80% of the question right and still get less than 30% of the score. Fuck those graders.
6484,2015-10-15 11:47:16,"No matter how hard I try I just can't seem to do anything right.  All my grades suck, but I'm constantly working and studying and I never feel like I have a life.  How come my roommate can drink and party all the time and rarely do work and do better than me?  What have I done wrong?  This school makes me hate myself more than I already do."
6485,2015-10-15 11:37:17,"I feel like I'm stuck in limbo. On one hand there are the undergrads, who often go out of their way to point out how old we are compared to them. There's also that not-so-subtle disdain about how we're not ""real"" MIT students, which I just love. And on the other hand there are my fellow graduate students, so many of whom are getting married and talking about kids and crap. Where any geeky hobby is only admitted under duress as some kind of guilty pleasure. Why isn't there a culture where we can just be ourselves? I don't care if you're married or just got out of high school. I don't care what course you are. I want to enjoy my twenties and not have to be ashamed of myself. Let's be silly together. Let's play board games and video games and get drunk. Let's debate the nature of the universe. I'm so tired of the age group clicks."

6492,2015-10-15 10:39:26,"Sometimes when I feel like my life is spiraling out of control and I'm going to fail everything at my second-tier school on long island, I hop onto the MIT Confessions page and realize my life isn't that bad. For people who the rest of the planet perceive to have their future ""set"", I have hardly seen a more miserable bunch. Every issue that is common to all college students appear intensified a thousand times in the experience of the MIT student, and it seems that because all are so preoccupied with their work, few have any disposition to provide one another with the time required to support each other's mental health; time that comes naturally to university environments with a weaker work ethic. As a mediocre student  at a mediocre university, I hope you all do well and live happy lives. Don't let the pressure you put on yourself do you in."

6495,2015-10-15 10:53:31,"I'm bi, but I've mostly dated guys here at MIT. How do I find the queer ladies on campus if I don't feel like walking around declaring my sexuality all the time?"

6498,2015-10-15 10:53:35,"When I committed to MIT, I promised myself I will never miss a lecture or recitation. So far so good on the lectures. I missed one recitation the other day though due to excruciating circumstances and I'm tearing myself up for that even though it wasn't my fault. And I'm a freshman."

This one I want to call out because a lot of activists here are being taken advantage of. We helped solar and wind companies. Did you know that most of them lose money yet still make a profit? The way they do that is tax breaks for them actually pay them money if they get a loss on paper. So they sell or even give away power to get a loss. They then claim they are cheaper then fossil fuels but if they charged prices to meet their real costs would go out of business. And then we the taxpayers foot the bill. These owners could not care less about the planet. They are using us green activists as pawns to get a government subsidized failing business. do to my fellow greens here let's call them out and push congress to change the tax code so they have to do honest work.

I guess you wouldn't be able to look at your notes if you were stranded on a desert island or something, but I can't imagine that that's what we're being prepared for. Why do I have to waste so much time making sure I remember formulas, definitions, etc. out of fear that forgetting one small thing could leave me unable to do an entire problem when in real life I'd be able to just quickly look up anything I couldn't remember at the moment and continue on? The only argument I can see against open book exams is that students may just show up for the exams without learning the material, but I'd argue that if you can essentially teach yourself a subject and complete a 50 minute exam in 50 minutes and get a good grade then you deserve it."

Nobody wants more deaths, truly.  We just want to fix this problem and no two people can agree on how it should be done.  I look to Switzerland as an example.  They have lots of guns but a nice low crime rate, because they're doing it right.  The U.S. has some serious problems in comparison.

In the meantime, I just want to secure my right to shoot at pieces of paper in an indoor environment with my expensive toy.  I don't want to hurt anyone.

6541,2015-10-05 11:59:13,"Since I've been here I've felt a bit of culture shock here and there. But not with what I expected. I grew up in a poor family. My dad finished high-school and never went to college, my mom didn't even finish high-school. They had to work 12+ hour shifts 6 or 7 days a week at dead end jobs to support us. I escaped reality by throwing myself into academics and got here as a result. My friends here have been supportive of me but there have been times where we had to deal with different sets of thinking. For example, both my parents smoke, my older brothers also smoke, and they all smoke in the house we live in. When I casually mentioned to my friends that they wouldn't like my house since it smells of heavy tobacco they flipped out and asked how any parent could subject their child to it and told me that I was an ""abuse victim"". It took a very long, patient, explanation and I want to share it because I feel that a lot of the middle class and rich students here do not get it, quite frankly. Most poor people smoke and are now the majority of smokers. One big reason is poor people don't get weekends, or vacations to a beach house, or yacht club. For many of them, a cigarette is the only break they get. And some people say, well what about 20 - 40 years from now? When you are barely scrapping enough money to pay rent and put food on the table today, 20 years from now is as far from  your mind as it can be. And about smoking in front of me, first of all, second hand smoke isn't nearly as dangerous as smoking itself, and if you read the studies, (I have quite thoroughly.) they admit you have to be around it in an extremely concentrated manner for decades to have any tangible effect. What I had, a few family members who would have a couple smokes after dinner at the table, does not nearly qualify. Also, my parents were both raised by chain smoking parents themselves, so this to them is very normal. What I ask my fellow students is to please stop rushing to judge poor people for not following middle class and wealthy people in lock step, money makes a massive difference. And please don't call me an ""abuse victim"". To compare people smoking cigarettes in front of you to a parent physically harming their child is insulting to people who have had to deal with it."

2. Guns laws have become much looser in recent decades and murder continues to drop lower and lower.

We approach religion from very different perspectives, I was raised non religious and converted to Catholicism when I was a freshman here and she has been non denominational her entire life. We agree on about 95% of religion. Yet she has actually sobbed hysterically over a couple minor teachings. The first is, she has a meltdown over the idea of building statues of saints, saying it amounts to idol worship and no man can be holy. If you can believe that a man was the son of God and died for our sins being resurrected three days later, believing another man to be without sin is a pretty easy leap of faith. But she doesn't buy that with the argument, we have to go by the bible and the bible only as she puts it. It's ""perfect"" and the only thing we can use in her eyes. She then gets even more upset when I point out that according to the book of Leviticus we have to execute numerous people for offenses such as touching pigskin, so goodbye NFL. We follow that with taking multiple wives and slaves, since very clear rules for that are also in the bible. She flunked the most basic bible history facts, such as the fact the the four gospels we use were taken from over 70 accounts of Jesus, or that in the old Testament, the idea of God acknowledged the existence of other pagan Gods, but saw the Jewish God as above all. The New Testament is where the idea of only one God existing and the others fake comes from. The bible is a set of metaphors and stories on how to live your life, excessive pride leads to your downfall, treat your neighbor as family, taking it literally is literally impossible. I converted on the understanding that this a great way to challenge yourself and make yourself a better person. Pope Francis convinced me to take a look and challenged my stereotypes of the church, I had some foolish preconceived notions of what Christianity was. I love the idea that greatness is serving others, not being served. I feel like I'm a vegetarian and she's a vegan screaming that I'm evil for eating cheese.

Today, I'm just a friend, and I don't mind. Your name's no longer written in the stars; the sweetness of your image, not haunting my mind. I face the world and don't expect your rescue. I look at you and just see you, with qualities and flaws, unbiased. The magic of your smile, your charm, and that angelic look, all gone.
 
Today has come and took away my pain, and those unrealistic hopes, and the exasperation. The day I glorified in expectation, who knew would leave me so alone, uncovered. Forever yours and never yours, deceived for what seems like a second and eternity alike, I mourn today. For what has set me free, has also killed me. The part that loved and could forgive, and see the best in you and me. And all the dreams, and hopes, and expectations. I mourn the wasted time, and pray for butterflies to spread its ashes over Charles. And for a snowfall on a silent winter night, to spread them over us, as both of us are sleeping, not for each other breathing. And letting go of jealousy and hurt, I still mourn you, my angel, bittersweet. The time ephemeral, my love ephemeral, your touch so gentle, and the gaze so loving, either a distant past or mere fantasy as they seem now. A la recherche du blaue Blume, I mourn the metaphysic time and place we could have been together. And I regret, incorrigible romantic, and I can only blame myself for letting the intangible thus slip away... Away from you, away from me, away from us...

6585,2015-09-30 10:54:31,"I am actually for standardized testing in its current form and I have a good reason. How else are we supposed to know how the kids from various districts are doing against one another without them? Teachers have every reason to game their own grades to make their own students look good. Giving every kid the exact same test and time limit is the only way we will actually know how the kids are doing. I hear people complain, ""oh teachers will have to teach to the test, we are not teaching critical thinking"". Yes we are. Life is about passing tests, we all passed tests to get in here, you have to pass tests to get a job, that's life, kids need to get that lesson. Most people don't use, and usually don't need critical thinking anyway. The real reason teachers are against it is because they don't want to face the music and have to take the chance that they might be exposed as incompetent and get fired. Also, nobody admits this, but they could actually turn down the standardized tests legally. All they have to do is turn down federal funding. But they won't do that, they like getting 165 days of paid vacation a year, fat pensions, fat insurance plans, and for the top ones, 6 figure salaries, more then their own school freedom."

Most people thought I was a lunatic or autistic, or some interesting combination of both. I slowly observed and learned how to do social skills with other people. My first two years here was a long painful series of poor interactions. I remember wanting to shout when people gave me odd looks, ""I'm trying to learn how to talk to you, I'm 10 years behind and I have to catch up, can you cut me some slack?!?!"" I slowly got better, made friends and even have a girlfriend now. They all actually make a point to help me be aware. So I want to let everyone else out there feeling like they can't learn to be normal with people, you can do it. It's going to hurt and be scary, but I promise with work and determination it gets better."

I dreaded walking into the locker room and being forced to take off my clothes and hear the laughter, the taunts, feel my humiliation rise. I was humiliated by the size of my penis. I remember them saying, ""Hey Donkey Slong, whens the new game coming out?"", ""What's with the third leg?"", and asking, ""What's with the timber between your legs?"". Their taunts towards me for it ran ceaselessly, that and the fact that I was openly homosexual."

6597,2015-09-30 10:11:57,"Depression is real man. If you're like me, you might lie to yourself about it--just because you feel everyone depends on you and you have to be strong for them. If you feel like you've hit rock bottom, talk to someone about it. At the end of the day, mental health is more important than anything else. If you're unhappy or stressed, just remember you have people that care about you and you are not alone. Until you are honest with yourself, you can't be honest with people. This is coming from someone who puts on a face everyday and smiles through all the bullshit. Just be real with yourself. If you can't handle all the commitments (as I'm realizing only 3 years later), don't try and be Superman. Just be happy."

6600,2015-09-25 08:37:12,"I was reading some [census] figures and trends the other day that disturbed me. I have always been a proud atheist, and a activist for atheists. I looked at the US birth rates. Secular and atheist birthrates are the lowest, and well below sustainability. Fertility for atheist women is about 1.5 children, hardcore religious, 2.5 - 6 per woman! Meaning the next generation of atheists will be smaller. Meanwhile the hardcore religious have the highest birthrates of all. The amish, mormons, devout Catholics, evangicals, all breed like rabbits. In the last 20 years the amish population has TRIPLED from birthrates alone. Immigrants here also tend to be more religious. If this continues in a couple generations we will go from a nation making secular progress back to a religious hive on the level of a middle eastern nation. So I urge all my fellow atheists and secular members, please make a point to have more children and raise them atheists. A good number to be safe is 3 or 4 children per couple to insure atheist population growth. I'm terrified to live in a world full of religious fanatics in a couple generations."

6602,2015-09-25 08:42:14,"There's a time that I admire people who do the little things in life that make everybody's life better. And then there's the time I walk in the first and second floors of the student center and I realize that there are people in this world who leave their garbage on the tables and chairs because they think the custodians are servants. They are humans who make a living by cleaning up the student center, to make it presentable. They attempt to make a positive environment for us so we can study and eventually make the world better. However, they shouldn't have to pick up rice, dirty napkins, and sticky sandwiches from the tables for you. Stop being lazy and just throw it in the trash can or recycle bin, whichever is appropriate. Spend an extra 3 minutes a day so that the facilities can have more time to focus on what they should. And, lastly, stop complaining that the facilities don't do enough. I'm sick of hearing people who quack around about MIT's maintenance being bad -- first, save them some time by being humane. 

MIT is about the sense of community. It's the people that make it the place it is -- the best place in the world. Thoughtless people who want to do nothing for the community are people who ruin this reputation. I can't believe there are actually people who don't feel this sense of belonging. Would you not help your family in every way possible even if it took half your life? All it takes is a few minutes of consideration every day. For your family -- MIT."

They were also more rude than average. I was sick the morning of registration, came late, and instead of being talked to like a reasonable adult, I was told ""If you really wanted to hack you would have showed up on time"" and sent away."
6608,2015-09-25 08:34:21,I hate when people are so enthralled about bullshit computer security debates.  It feels like most of MIT cares more about idealism and technology than about others' day to day struggles and feelings.

Then the more I thought about it, the more I realized that although it was obvious to me, many people didn't get it. So I'll say why we like it. My gf gets stressed and for her giving up all control and being forced into pain is comforting and relaxing. Like all couples we have arguments and can get angry, for me the sadistic role is a good outlet to unleash my anger in a controlled way. Once I'm done being rough S&M with her, I'll then be very gentle, the sudden change from brutal to gentle is very relaxing for her and makes the gentle touch feel so much better."

6617,2015-09-25 08:47:33,"I've been involved with the feminist movement since high school, we've been trying to challenge much of society. But one thorn has always stood in the way. I have tried to bring up the issue of rap music. Some of it is okay, but the feminist movement has as a whole turned a blind eye towards its openly misogynistic lyrics and attitudes. I tried to bring it up in my high school group once, and was told flat out that because it is a black art form, criticizing it in any way was racist. Criticizing Ludacris for saying he has, ""hoes in different area codes"" is not a critique of the color of his skin, it's a critique of his character and work. I've seen some great feminists on this campus. Please make a point to call out rap music, it has been allowed to get away with too much. If it's okay to call out frat boys for ""No means yes, and yes means anal"", then rappers are going right with them. Nobody should get a free pass for sexism. That's true equality."

6641,2015-09-23 09:25:25,"Earlier I posted a confession about the level of sexual acts I have witnessed here. I want to anonymously address two comments there which addressed good points.

One asked if I felt that a womans value only came from her sexual history and willingness. The other asked why I was talking about the women and not the men involved. The reason I choose to address women is because I feel this is an issue that harms women the most. To the women here I will be completely honest with you. The harsh reality is, in our society you have very little power as a whole. Men hold most of it. Sex is one of the few areas you can say no to definitively. Power is the ability to say no. The second you give that up, you lose power. This is not going to change anytime soon. Men have sex for very different reasons then you do. Women for the most part see it as the beginning of developing an emotional bond. Men simply see it as a recreational activity. Sex may be an act of love and fun for women, but for men it's an act of power, control, recreation, and in some negative circumstances, violence. Men tend to get into relationships and marriage for regular guaranteed sex, not so much the emotional bonds that women get into relationships for.

To answer the question of the value of women, no a woman's intrinsic human value is not based on sexual history. Unfortunately for men, her value as a partner in a relationship is. And guilt tripping men trying to tell them to change millions of years of gut instinct is not going to help. What I am recommending to women is to wait for a committed relationship. You have to make your partner wait, treat you well, and value you, and work for you physically. People value scarcity. And the key to dealing with the power dynamic of sex is to get the guy to commit then get sex. That way even though you have submitted and relinquished sex, he has submitted and relinquished some of his freedom. That way even though you have given up the sexual power, he still respects you and treats you well."

6643,2015-09-23 09:48:27,"I dealt with mental health issues related to depression and anxiety last year and for a while I thought I was better.  I stopped taking my medication (under help from my doctor) and in general my anxiety got better, and my depression improved as well.

Little did I know that was simply due to it being close to the end of the year.  Starting up this year, I'm once again faced with the mountains of Psets, essays, and labs that just take a toll on me.  It's so hard to talk to anyone about anything, and honestly I view the whole TMAYD thing as just another fad for people to pretend to care to look popular.  I know it's not everyone but that's definitely the vibe I get.  Holding up a facade towards your friends tires me out just as much as Psets do.

It's hard to talk to anyone, and for the love of god I don't want to go back on my medication.  It helps with the anxiety and depression, but it makes me feel like a zombie.

I wonder how long it will take for the administration to say something about mental health this year.  I don't want to have to hear about another suicide and I think we need to have legitimate, preemptive discussions about mental health.

But that's just me, and I'm a cynic at heart, I suppose."

I'm pale, you can tell I'm part black when I grow my hair out but I tend to keep it short and everyone who doesn't know me assumes I'm a tan white guy, and usually they guess I'm Italian. When I applied my guidance counselor who was white tried to get me to put down black as my race. I pointed out that I look white and am mostly white so white made the most sense. He persisted and made the argument that I've had a ""tough time"" as a ""person of color"" in life, so I should do it to ""help ease the admissions process"". I'm from a rich Jewish long island suburb I've been very fortunate. So I want to say to all white people out there who I one of, black people are not your little pity cases. Doing someone a favor for no reason other then them being black is condescending. Stop trying to be a white savior. If you really want to help black people then stop trying to tell them what race they are and that they are victims. I'm not a victim, maybe some of my ancestors were, but I'm far from it, I'll pull myself up by my own bootstraps."

I talked to my dad about what girls are willingly to do now and he was baffled. He talked about coming here in the 60's and how back then you didn't even get into bed with most girls until you were married or you promised her marriage. The reason it concerns me is how I'm honestly not sure how a lot of guys are going to be able to have normal relationships with one woman after getting Caligula style acts from various women. I'll admit it was really hard for me to settle down with one girl now. Guys, it is honestly worth it, but you have to train yourself to enjoy it."

When converting the earnings of the student family from foreign currency to dollars, they use the exchange rate that was most favorable to MIT in the whole previous year.

6665,2015-09-15 11:33:17,When I was a kid I was never allowed to play outside without an adult. I wasnt allowed to walk to school alone until I was a teenager despite living three blocks away. My parents watched documentaries on kidnapped kids all the time and I would watch too. Then I came here and for the first time in my life had to study and work and live without an adult telling me what to do. I was frightened to tears. I'm a junior now and I'm glad I had to learn those things. I began asking questions such as what is the danger of a stranger kidnapping a child in a white suburban neighborhood?

My new advisor replied that he's honestly excited to get to know me better. He said he was going to work with me to figure out how to survive MIT. He didn't care that my GPA is bad. This unexpected support and acceptance made me sit down and sob for the first time in months.

I didn't know why I was crying at first, but then I realized it was just the relief that someone was finally NOT judging me for my grades. Everyone who has seen my academic record just assumes things about me, because after all, how can you get D's and still deserve to be at MIT?

I realized that this is the first time in two years that I've felt like more than the sum of my GPA and academic achievements. That's how I know this is such a fucked up place. Somehow, the faculty and staff have lost humanity amidst psets and exams and grades. I even forgot that I'm more than a sum of my academic achievements. It's easy to say to each other ""oh, you are more than your grades,"" but when your professors and advisor and faculty and mentors don't echo the same message, that's when things get bad.

Thank God for this professor. To anyone else out there who feels like they're absolute shit because their academic record isn't perfect, you are SO MUCH MORE than grades and psets and exams and school. You are a complex, beautiful, amazing human being and you deserve to be treated that way. Please don't forget it <3"

6742,2015-05-12 13:39:50,"Gotta love how many of y'all will loudly and publicly idealize, fantasize, and discuss suicide to cope with other problems. Realize that reaching the planning and execution stage will shut anyone right up. Things get unfunny really quickly when you start visualizing the reactions of each person you know. The faces of your family as their entire world falls apart. A confused somber for your closer friends. An existential crisis for those who've looked up to you in any serious way. And the dehumanizing realization you're totally OK with all that if only it would stop the agony: physical, emotional, existential, and/or otherwise. 

I just wish all the fuckwits who aren't actually planning on killing themselves would quit talking about it. You drown out those who are. 

There is a healthy way to deal with suicide. You stay quiet and *watch* for troubled faces. You actively seek the advice and company of friends, family, your doctors when you are having trouble yourself. You don't create more noise by word vomiting about the time you felt like you wanted to die because you had a bad week anonymously online. 

For all you know, the guy/gal/other who looked fine in class yesterday might have a bag of horse in a drawer, waiting for the perfect spring day to fall asleep. And they might have spoken up if it weren't for the overdramatic little shitlets surrounding them."

But sometimes I feel like it's all worthless just because something small fucked up my whole day or my whole week.  And that little something tends to be connected to a larger problem in my life, like it's indicative of something I hate about myself and that I suspect other people hate.  At moments like these, I sometimes go on Amazon, search ""sleeping pills"", and debate buying a bunch just so I can have a stash if I ever decide to kill myself in the future.  It's not that I thoroughly hate myself.  It's just that sometimes I want to see what would happen if I really was gone forever.  How would my family take it, how would MIT take it, how would my friends take it, how would people in my dorm and especially my hallmates take it?

For the longest time, I loved my dorm, my hall, my hall mates. They were my best friends, people I hung out with, people I did my homework with. I cared so much about every single one of them and was there for them all the time. I thought it was the same for me too. I thought that they would stop by my door and ask why I haven't been to class for that long. I thought they would stop by to ask if I was ok, maybe give me a hug and tell me that everything would be ok. But they never did. And that's when I stopped giving a shit about them. I stopped caring and constantly trying to fit in. If you don't care about me, why would I care about you?
Now I see them wear the wristband. And it bothers me so much to see how pretentious they are. This whole movement is really a noble act, but there's only a small percent of people wearing those words know the meaning of them by heart.

I can try my best with the assurance that I won't be labelled for it and in that label-less void I can choose what I want to be labelled and known as, and be able to embrace and laugh at the fact that frankly, I'm an idiot around here. Yeah, it's an insecure feeling, and it sucks with the pressure of classes and whatnot to feel inferior or less smart than others, but take some time to really think about what a great opportunity it is, we're all here cause we're smart and chances are before MIT and once we go out in the real world with the MIT label we'll never have much of a chance to shape our own label. But for 4 years over here we can escape that and truly find our personality, and that, frankly, is just amazing, and is probably the biggest reason I love this beautiful place :)"

Every day right when she stood up to leave, I'd say to myself ""This is your last chance. It's now or never."" But when you have trouble talking to people even to introduce yourself, asking someone out is a long long shot. And then one day, just like that, it did become my last chance and I didn't take it. She stopped showing up and ever since, I can't stop regretting being such a chicken. Once on a blue moon, I see her in the infinite. I want to smile at her or just say hi but I just walk away as fast as I can. If only I had more courage. If only I could get one more chance to ask her out. Oh and the best part? I don't even know her name."
6796,2015-04-13 15:52:32,"Being a physics student in university, naturally I am surrounded by a plethora of highly intelligent peers. The one complaint I hear the most is not whether someone failed a test or is worried about getting into grad school, rather it is the fact that they can't seem to find a girlfriend. That being said, I also know many highly intelligent guys who have amazing relationships; in fact intelligent people have the potential to have the greatest relationship because they can be so creative with birthday, Christmas gifts, and other aspects of the relationship! However, there is at least a significant proportion of highly intelligent guys who mope around, complaining about being single and not knowing what to do about it. There are plenty of articles online saying that the solution is to stop being so arrogant about intelligence and to “chill out” but I think the problem really boils down to being too idealistic about the natural selection process. 

“My genes are superior, why doesn’t she choose me?”

The first thing you need to realize is that getting a girlfriend is a skill that needs to be developed, just like soldering a circuit board, just like doing surface integrals in your Calc. III class. While you were sitting at home perfecting word for word the solution to your next real analysis homework, your competitor was out there performing some APPLIED analysis on the girl psyche and figuring how to woo her heart and make her smile. That's why he has a hot girlfriend and you have, well, your left hand. Too many intelligent guys think that women are things to be earned, things that they are entitled to. That if you worked hard and made a lot of money or became famous in your field, women will come flocking to you. This may be true if you’re Elon Musk, but for the rest of us mortals, finding a (hot?) girl that is worth hanging onto requires practice and diligence. Sure if you’re striving to be the next Newton and couldn’t give two shits about human intimacy then please be my guest and continuing carving out human history undistracted. Most guys want successful, enriching relationships and therefore need to put the work in, to get the work out.

“I have a 6-pack and I’m on my way to a PhD in physics, so what’s the problem?”

I have many friends who are both intelligent and physically fit, the two traits required for successful natural selection, or you would think anyway. One of them said to me the other day “I’m working up to 205lb on the bench press, unless I hit that, I’m not going to talk to any girls.” This is exactly the type of thinking that will make sure you stay single until you’re 80 and your balls turn into raisins. Being able to bench press or being brilliant at electrodynamics and being a good (enjoyable) boyfriend are completely different faculties. If you asked any given girl (even the most intelligent ones), most of them will say being intelligent or talented in a certain field is a bonus and NOT the deciding factor in picking a boyfriend. At the end of the day, the goal of every girl on earth is to be happy and you can provide this happiness (and receive it too!) by developing loyalty, sympathy, and a sense of humor (characteristics that were unanimously voted the most sought after in a guy by girls across the 11 dimensions).

“The problem is them, not me!”

At the end of the day you might think everything I’ve said is bullshit and that the only reason why you don’t have a girlfriend is because there are no intelligent but pretty girls out there that suit you. But just remember this, given the off chance that you do one day come across that unicorn-of-a-girl, do you really want your romantic abilities to be as linear as your ODE assignment?"
6797,2015-04-13 15:38:33,"It's the end of my freshman year, and I still feel like I haven't found a group of people I could see myself remaining friends with for years and years. I feel like college is where I'm supposed to be having the time of my life, meeting my best friends for eternity, but I'm really not. 

I don't even know how to describe it. I have friends I can talk to, and I have friends I can work with. But besides stress and science, I do not know anyone who gives a fuck about the things that I care about or whose sense of humor I instantly click with...not to say that I'm not incredibly grateful for the friends I have, but it seems like we can only spend so long in a room together before we get tired of each other. People listen to you if you make noise, but then when you're done crying, you go back to your separate lives and psets. I guess this is why people get into relationships--to have someone else who is emotionally invested in your life. But there never seems to be enough time for a relationship here at MIT. 

I hope no one else feels this lonely right now, but if you do, know that you are not alone. I pray that it gets better from here."

6821,2015-03-29 08:18:25,"Her mother said that Tina loved MIT. 

She even insisted that it be said at the memorial, but I don’t think anyone listened. We were too busy screaming at the administration and lamenting our “deplorable” mental health system to possibly listen to something so contrary to our preconceptions.

The second Reif’s email was sent, our minds were made up. We saw the headline and we extrapolated a story. A story about a lonely, depressed, isolated girl who clearly just needed a little more support from her friends and a little better institutionalized mental health system to keep going. For the vast majority of us, the Tina we mourn is the Tina we projected - invented, even - from just a few tiny little facts that correlate so little with the person underneath. 

Remember Orientation? And REX? Remember meeting hundreds upon hundreds of people, and asking them all the same three questions? Where are you from? Where do you live? What’s your major? And do you remember that delicate, thoughtful realization two months later that all three of those data points mean jack shit about the person living behind those bullet points.

It’s horrible. Cruel. Cold, even. But we did it. We did it to our classmates, we did it to Matthew, and we did it to Christina. We filled in the gaps of what we don’t know with whatever we decided “should” make sense. We fabricated causes and reasons and circumstances and what-if’s and should-have’s. We projected our own issues and struggles and demons into their lives. And by the time the real details were released it was too late, because we’d already solidified our snap judgments about how and why. We’d already deduced “the story”, and nothing would dissuade us from raising our voices and taking up the “noble cause” to fight whatever villain we decided to lynch - in this case, the administration. Or “the culture”. Or Columbo. I’m not even sure, maybe we haven’t finished casting the role yet. I’m sure we will soon.

It’s shocking - in a very literal sense - when something this tragic happens in our community. But we need to be very careful of our own biases, lest they run wild and cause even more collateral damage. Maybe change needs to happen. Probably. But it can’t happen in an emotional frenzy, and it definitely shouldn't be driven by the ghost of a shell we thought we knew.

Tina loved MIT. Always remember that."

I'm happy to say that they were entirely wrong. If the recent events have shown me anything, it's how supportive and caring the MIT community is. The way our community has come together astounds me. I've noticed how everyone has become so much more aware and caring, taking the time to check up on close friends and even those who we've only met once. 

Forgive me for trying to put a positive spin on things, but I can't begin to say how proud I am to be part of the MIT community, and I'm so thankful for the opportunity to be here. Christina and Matthew, I wish you had the chance to see MIT the way I do. All I can hope is that this support continues even when our campus isn't experiencing tough times.

""Why would anyone take less than 48 units?"" Like, I know we're all just filling the void of insecurity we secretly harbor, but come on.

There are many things we can't change about MIT, but this is something we can. Let's stop putting each other down and enforcing impossible standards on ourselves. We're smarter than that.

I think what's different about this tragedy for me is that it no longer seems unattached and distant from my life. I don't know everything Matthew was going through, but I know how impossible it can seem to balance horribly difficult academics with family issues, self loathing, and loneliness in the mix. To lose Matthew like this feels like a bitter blow to everyone battling their personal demons, because there's no reason this may not have been me or any of us. 

Please pay attention to one another. I don't care who you are; we aren't so different. We all need support and love and positivity wherever we can get it.

Yesterday I talked my boyfriend into going to Petco with me and we bought a leather collar and lead for me. We may have tried too hard to make it convincing that we were shopping for an actual dog. I then had him walk me home with it. 
Now he's gone back to his apartment and I'm wearing it while studying for finals. I can't wait to go home for winter break so he can take me on a walk in the forest preserve back home...  
I really think I'm too into bondage and role playing. 
Like... is it worrying that I'm just sitting here with a collar on? 
I just really love the idea of it all. Being a pet. Being entirely under someone else's control, not having my human life to worry about, just worrying about pleasing one person in a way that isn't measured in ""success"" for once. 
It's a really damn good escape.  
Also, I love my boyfriend so much for putting up with all my quirks and insanity like this. Like... I don't think I could ever find another guy who'll be okay with putting a dog collar around my neck and whipping me with the leash lol. I think true love is being willing to put up with your significant other insisting on being treated like a pet lmfao"

I mean it's very nice of you that you're offering. But if you're only doing it just because she's female, you're reinforcing this idea that women are incapable of doing physical things like lifting a table."
6906,2014-12-13 14:08:19,"I don't understand why MIT decided to remove Walter Lewin's videos from OCW. I understand that his actions are not good ones and should be punished, but I don't think it's right to remove the lectures of a great professor from a free website that's supposed to be a database of classes. Lewin's lectures have helped plenty of students around the world learn physics. Why is it that his mistakes have to deprive future students from learning? 

Is there no separation of the professor from the person? I get that MIT may not want to associate with him during these allegations, but I'm still bothered by the removal of a great resource because of the actions of the person. We're burning 'books' and removing an amazing way to learn and experience a subject because the author did a bad thing, and that scares me."

6908,2014-12-13 14:54:21,"I'm a white girl only attracted to asian girls. I feel very comfortable being openly lesbian at MIT, and I'm very thankful for that. But I feel extremely uncomfortable discussing my specific racial attraction with anyone because it's 'textbook racist' behavior. There's always the assumption that you're some sort of exotic-seeking-yellow-fever-pervert. ALWAYS.

I've made genuine efforts to be physically attracted to non-asian people but haven't been able to. I'm not sure I fully control that. I REALLY have tried. But my sexual attraction doesn't make any assumptions about your culture or dictate your social worth--it's pretty much based ONLY on what you look like. And apparently, I'm not attracted to non-asian faces. I don't understand why that's necessarily racist. On the other hand, no one thinks I'm sexist for only liking girls. 

Yes, all my relationships have been with asian girls, but they've been meaningful and with people I loved, and saying that I dated them ""just because they were asian"" is like saying I dated them ""just because they were girls"". I only date people I can be attracted to--but that's not exactly shocking behavior.

But there's SO MUCH stigma against white people exclusively dating asian girls.  I don't know if I'll ever feel comfortable talking about this part of myself, even though I don't understand why it offends people. Why does it feel like all the orientation tolerance and openness at MIT extends only to a narrow range of ""socially acceptable"" sexual orientations? Doesn't that defeat the point?"

At first, he was talking about us getting into a relationship once I'd adjusted to my first year in college and could get semi-regular transportation to Cambridge but, at some point, I think he decided I was only worth fucking- not loving. Part of me still hates myself for not getting into MIT (maybe we would've had something legitimate), but another part of me is grateful that I wasn't able to get into a relationship with someone who'd probably never known how to love me in the first place."

Even before this semester started one of the freshman posted a blog in our facebook group about how people told her she was too pretty or normal to go to MIT and she felt like she was being discriminated. It seems like the people here who are really outgoing and social are almost ashamed of the people here on campus who are not like them. The reality is that many people here are quiet and introverted or weird. And I'm not sure those outgoing people here would be the same way if they had the same experiences I have had with people. Don't pretend that the nerdy, weird, or quiet people here don't exist. I exist :("

You guys have had to deal with immeasurable injustice and that understandably greatly affects the way you see and interact with the world. But I think the strong feelings you have about this should facilitate greater discussion not smother it. Black people, and other minorities, are exactly who I should be talking to to really understand and educate myself about racism. I think its vital that people not be afraid to. 

I'm not saying don't be angry. Be angry. But know that I'm angry too. Our justice system is fucked, and I'm not okay with living in a country that doesn't truly protect all of its citizens. But please don't take lack of awareness as an affront.

I didn't want people coming into my room and seeing and smelling my pee-filled cups.
I threw away the cups.  But habits are hard to break.  Now I pee in my trash.  But I only take out the trash once a week.  Now my room smells so badly of old pee and I am too embarrassed to take out the trash in case someone smells my trash bag (it smells REALLY bad).
I am waiting until 4 am to take out my trash.

Too often I hear reports of two people, who are both drunk, hooking up and then the girl suddenly proclaims to be the victim even though both parties gave their consent (even if under the influence).  Then the case becomes her word against his word and in our society now there is a presumption of guilt with the man. For example the Duke lacrosse scandal a couple years ago ruined several young men's lives even though it was later found that they were completely innocent, as the ""victim"" simply lied.  I believe that if found guilty the perpetrators should be punished severely and swiftly, but in a country based on a presumption of innocence, I think the overreaction to sexual assault accusations goes against this foundational American value."
6958,2014-11-15 15:56:59,I want to get drunk and make out with everyone on my 2.009 team.

6960,2014-11-15 15:14:12,"To whoever posted #1513: Thanks for the heads up. But it's an icosahedron, not a dodecahedron! Get your regular polyhedra straight!"
6961,2014-11-15 15:03:13,"I am a mess, I feel extremely happy one moment then I go to my room and get absolutely sad. I met people at the beginning of the year and we would ""keep in touch"" but it hasn't happened. I feel less motivated than in high school, I don't know what to study. People in my dorm become more and more distant and everything seems to go from bad to worse. When I stop exercising I immediately gain weight, and I don't have the money to be in a meal plan. I just want someone to cuddle and smoke with."
6962,2014-11-15 14:52:14,"The problem I have with being friends with straight girls is that I have a really hard time telling the difference between them actually being interested in me, and them being affectionate with me because they're just super comfortable with me."
6963,2014-11-15 14:43:15,I've masturbated to the Anaconda music video. Multiple times. I'm female.
6964,2014-11-15 14:29:16,"to the person living in the single next to me...You're always so quiet but I always wonder if you can hear my frantic phone calls to my parents and the conversations I have with my friends, or the weird music I play at 3 am, or the arguments I have with my boyfriend. I wonder if you have this strange window into my life when I barely ever hear anything from your side of our common wall..."
6965,2014-11-15 14:18:17,I feel guilty when I sleep more than 7 hours.
6966,2014-11-13 23:04:19,ryone! I am conducting a study on the relationship between the use of anonymous campus centered forums (such as this confession page) and satisfaction with the respective offline community. I would be very appreciative if you wouldn't mind taking a few minutes to complete my survey! Everything is completely anonymous. Feel free to message me with any questions you may have. Thank you so much for your time!
6967,2014-11-11 12:15:20,"I am a virgin. I want my first time to be with someone who cares enough about me to make it as enjoyable as possible, but it is hard to find people who are looking for relationships and not hookups so idk I feel like I'm missing out on a lot of potential sex lmao"
6968,2014-11-11 12:03:21,I skipped leg day.
6969,2014-11-11 12:53:22,"A week after uploading my pset to stellar, I realized I had accidentally submitted a GBA emulator file instead of the scan of my pset. Oops."
6970,2014-11-11 12:44:24,why does google seem to have a thing for hiring white girls or girls who look white?
6971,2014-11-11 12:33:25,"Think being an MIT student is hard? Try being poor, a minority, an immigrant, AND an MIT student. I'M NOT WORKING RIGHT NOW MOM please stop calling to ask me if I can bail out my relatives from jail. No I cannot call the 10 lawyers cause I have psets instead. I'm only 20."
6972,2014-11-11 12:08:26,"I take my anger out on cyclists who think they are above the law. With a simple phrase like ""the light is red you piece of shit!"" you too can reduce stress and increase safety!"
6973,2014-11-11 12:56:27,"I wish I could just do research and never have to take classes. Research is great: there's no exams, I can choose the timeslots at which I want to work, I can put on headphones and ignore the world, and best of all, I can still do competent lab work while mildly inebriated."
6974,2014-11-11 12:40:28,someone from class council won the 2017 ring. surprise.
6975,2014-11-11 12:31:31,I only look at girls from the back because they be frontin
6976,2014-11-11 12:16:32,"Why can't I read you? We text, we talk. Is there more to this? I feel like Britney Spears, cause you drive me crazy."
6977,2014-11-11 12:05:33,"Dear Dodecahedron Dude:
Your lamp is really cool. It's always there in your window, emitting a soft, welcoming glow. My whole floor loves to watch your lamp. We also, mostly incidentally, watch you.
You might consider buying some blinds. We saw you on Halloween night ;) Maybe buy two thin ones, so you can block the view to your bed without blocking our view of your sexy, sexy dodecahedron."
6978,2014-11-11 12:50:35,What am I doing wrong in that I don't know of any of the parties going on ever?
6979,2014-11-11 12:36:38,"I'm asexual, but I would give anything not to be."
6980,2014-11-06 12:23:39,I actually donated to the UGC because I critically looked at the campaigns they were supporting and found one that I believed could benefit the world. Maybe next year you could do the same?
6981,2014-11-06 12:11:41,"If you take MIT Confessions seriously, you're doing it wrong."
6982,2014-11-06 12:57:50,"Is anybody else really annoyed about how far just ""networking"" can get you? I grew up in a relatively poor family, and my parents weren't friends with anybody, and they also didn't know(and therefore never taught me) any of the American social courtesies. Like, I never ever said ""thank you"" to anyone until middle school, when people started pointing out how rude I was to not say certain things.  

When I first started going to science camps in high school, I was really impressed with everyone and felt inferior to everyone. I met people who had already done research before, or who had done these science olympiads, or had built robots and stuff. But then I just kept hearing these recurring stories, like ""blah blah my parents knew this one guy and that's how I started research"" or ""blah blah my teacher got me started in this"" or even ""blah blah oh yeah my relative works in [insert college] admissions, so I'm not worried about getting in"" blah blah blah. Oh and also “blah blah I found out about his camp because one of my friends went here.” Lol I felt incredibly odd for being the only person who found camps by googling stuff with the keywords “science” and “financial assistance.” I don't think those people even realize how privileged they are. To have even the smallest bit of guidance from somebody, or a nudge onto a path of success, or the tiniest bit of assurance that your life will turn out fine even if you do one thing wrong-- those are HUGE privileges. 

I find it so weird that had I not started googling things that one night when I felt too exhausted to do work, or started applying to those camps on a whim, I probably never would have even known what a tiny bubble I had been living in, and about the countless opportunities that other people took for granted. I probably never would have applied to MIT. 

Now that I’m at MIT, I realize that I have become one of those privileged people, and that I have the opportunity to network if I so choose—that some person would give something I say more consideration just because I go to MIT. And I hate the fact that door is open to me. I hate the fact that door is open to anyone. After so many years of living in fear of the future, and having no idea where my life was headed, I don’t think I’ll ever be comfortable accepting anything I didn’t directly earn through grueling, hard work. I am afraid of who I would become if I let my successes become a crutch."
6983,2014-11-06 12:23:51,"I couldn't be any more happier with weed. With one hit after the other, slowly I begin to immerse myself in a world full of serenity. And it isn't until I get high that I begin to appreciate the small things in life, things that I usually forget to even think about at MIT amidst all the stress. MaryJane <3"
6984,2014-11-06 12:55:52,Am I the only one who hasn't had his/her first kiss? How do you do it?!!

6988,2014-11-06 12:02:59,I believe in NoFap. Its barely been two weeks and I've cummed in a girl during sex for the first time in almost a year. I have more time and better focus. Life is getting better
6989,2014-11-06 12:47:10,Sometimes I give up on masturbating so that I can cry.
6990,2014-11-06 12:30:12,I am a Greek man and I am really disappointed at the IFC's incompetence to maintain the MIT fraternal image in public. Why can't we just have a council made of the presidents from all frats? I trust those presidents more than some dutches in the IFC. I hope that the next IFC exec will do a better job.
6991,2014-11-06 12:17:13,"I understand how walking without shoes can be healthier and more comfortable, but if every time you wiggle your toes it smells like tuna fish gone bad, y'all need to cover that up."

6994,2014-11-06 12:22:16,I googled how Halal food is made (because it's always served in a lot of the dining halls to accommodate religious people's diets) and I've got to say that's pretty fucked. An animal has to be fully conscious after being stabbed in the neck/gut so it can bleed out over a few agonizing minutes because a mystical book says that's the way it should be? Fucking insane.

6996,2014-11-01 11:15:19,my standards for guys have definitely changed. i now look at a guy and if i think he looks financially stable i am turned on
6997,2014-11-01 11:49:20,I wish it was more socially acceptable to ask someone you think is super attractive to make out with you in a sober environment.
6998,2014-11-01 11:41:21,"I've never really liked PBE, but gotta say that Halloween party last night was insane."
6999,2014-11-01 11:29:22,"I'm a guy. I've been told I've had a sizeable butt for quite some time. In most cases, my butt is bigger than my female friends'. Despite how i react initially, i love it when my female friends slap/grab my ass. I have no idea why, but I love the sensation."
7000,2014-11-01 11:19:24,"lab literally sucks my soul. Everytime I leave it, I feel so dead."
7001,2014-11-01 11:02:25,"I got externship offers and asked my dad for advice on which I should pick. He wasn't impressed because none of the companies are ""big"" and he thinks I probably wouldn't learn that much. Sometimes I get sick of this. Why the freak is this still happening? I thought I left 'not good enough' behind in freshman year but it's still following me around and it pisses me off."
7002,2014-11-01 11:38:26,"I masturbated during the fire alarm at baker last night instead of evacuating.  If there was a real fire, that's the way I'd want to go out anyway #noragrets"
7003,2014-11-01 11:26:27,"Oh, ADD medication.  You are such a fickle mistress.  With one hand, you bestow the ability to concentrate for more than thirty seconds, and with the other, you sucker punch me right in the appetite and sex drive.  I'm losing too much weight and my girlfriend is getting frustrated, but I have a fighting chance to not completely flame out academically."
7004,2014-11-01 11:07:28,"I'm tired of hearing all these 16s complaining about how hard Unified is. Oh, no you need to learn the most basic ass intro content to courses 6 and 2 while learning some of your actual major...fluids. Welcome to engineering-where, for the first time, you need to know more than the name of every jet and rocket to be considered an engineer. 
Oh, wow you attached an arduino to a balloon. Good luck on your foam planes next semester. It's not exactly rocket science."
7005,2014-11-01 11:52:31,It seems pretty rude to tag someone in the comments of a confession. Doesn't that defeat the whole purpose of it being anonymous? Now tons of MIT people they may not even know will assume that they are on cocaine or masturbating in front of their roomate's parents.
7006,2014-11-01 11:17:32,Can confirm. There is Comic Sans on the 2017 Brass Rat
7007,2014-11-01 11:06:33,"Should I be worried if I'm getting C's in all my classes? I'm trying the hardest I can with 8 hours of sleep and my UROP. I have a fairly solid basic understanding of what I'm learning but nothing special. I could try to get B's, but that would require dropping the UROP I care about and giving up some sleep."
7008,2014-11-01 11:51:35,"Evolution naturally exists to move away from undesirable traits in a population, all the while increasing diversity so that the population as a whole becomes more resistant to being wiped out by one event. I think that's a distinction that gets faded by super ""accept everyone"" liberal environments. Diversity is sweet, celebrate that shit m8. But undesirable traits shouldn't be celebrated. Tl;dr: ""Thin privilege"" doesn't exist, it's called evolution."
7009,2014-11-01 11:35:38,"I couldn't finish the last 6.006 pset because I was horny all day and couldn't get off to hash functions. Welp, I need the weekend."
7010,2014-11-01 11:24:39,I walk on the second floor of the infinite to avoid the UGC beggers.
7011,2014-11-01 11:13:41,"I don't know why anyone has mentioned this but the TDC pledges made an awesome performance during SK Late Night. The pledges singing salsa, rapping, and singing some screamo were pretty sexy! I'll make sure to thank them personally. ;)"
7012,2014-11-01 11:00:50,Not sure why there's been so much East-West Campus hating lately.  East Campus wants administration to stop messing with its dorms.  West campus wants administration to stop messing with its fraternities.  What's actually the problem here?
7013,2014-11-01 11:48:51,guy who lives in the reading room. yea you...... the fuck man?
7014,2014-11-01 11:34:52,"Every time I meet a guy, he asks me if I go to Wellesley. No dammit."
7015,2014-10-30 11:01:54,"I'm only good at white people sports like lacrosse, investment banking, and cocaine."
7016,2014-10-30 11:00:55,I don't understand why some students don't wear shoes. I would ask someone walking around with bare feet but I'm afraid to get yelled at for restricting them to a binary
7017,2014-10-30 11:00:57,"There's so much social pressure to be ""caring"" or ""empathetic"", but I don't understand it. Someone posted a while ago that they think their ""empathy is broken"", and I really feel the same - I knew Phoebe, but her death really, truly did not perturb me in the slightest. Sometimes I think that there's something wrong with me, and sometimes I think there's something wrong with the rest of the world, but I legitimately don't give a fuck about ""feelings"", ""honor"", ""empathy"" or other intangibles. 

This doesn't mean I'm continuously rude or selfish - I know how society works and conscious play the game to get ahead. But every expression, word, and action is a deliberate, calculated move to achieve a goal, never a relatable reaction. Usually this is exhilarating - liberating - I feel like I'm in absolute control of my life and most of the world around me - I feel like I can effect virtually anything I choose just by coordinating the right sequence of moves in the game.

But other times it's crushing, lonely, and bland, as if I've beaten the game but am still trapped in the same campaign, over and over and over again. Sometimes I'm ridiculously paranoid about people's motives, envisioning elaborate cons that they're manipulating, but in the end I'm only dreaming, *wishing* that they were because then I wouldn't be the only one.

Usually when I confide this to people, they'll smirk and nod, think I'm obsessed with Sherlock or Spock, and secretly lament that I've been so sheltered. When I do actually experience loss or [emotional stimulant], they say, I'll realize how foolish I am. Then they go back to their shallow little lives, splash around in their kiddie pool of friends and, if they're lucky or ambitious, make a few ripples of drama in society at large. Good for them.

Maybe someday, something horribly tragic (or terribly good) will happen to me and I'll snap out of it, discover empathy, and cannonball into the kiddie pool myself. 
The worst part is that I can't decide if I want that to happen or not."
7018,2014-10-30 11:00:59,Someone that I know on my floor remembers girls based only on their nationality. He's a cockybastard but I love him anyways
7019,2014-10-30 11:00:10,I wrote the rough drafts for every single one of my 24.01 philosophy papers while on acid.
7020,2014-10-30 11:00:12,"this is getting ridiculous. it feels like we should still be together and i can't tell how much of this is me trying to deny the facts and hope blindly and how much of this is the fact that you're still around me all the time. i can't even tell if you actually want to be around me or if you just feel like you have to anymore. 

i let you go because it felt like you wanted to go. now you're just staying at this awkward distance. if i could have my way i'd take you back and keep you all for myself. but it feels like for your sake i have to really let go."
7021,2014-10-30 11:00:13,I am more worried about not having enough time to try a piece of every 2018 PBE Pledge before I graduate than actually graduating.
7022,2014-10-28 20:39:14,I've been telling people that I already voted for UGC so they'll leave me alone in the infinite...
7023,2014-10-28 20:20:15,A brass rat is a huge turn on for me. Like damn baby you made it through at least 2 years of MIT how much of that restrained suffering and anger will you let out in bed???
7024,2014-10-28 20:07:16,"All I want are friends who will listen to my problems, actually care about me, and not be judgmental about it. Is that too much to ask for around here?"
7025,2014-10-28 20:56:17,"Went to MIT medical with ebola. They gave me a few crackers and told me to eat bland foods. Needless to say, I made an instant recovery."
7026,2014-10-28 20:44:19,"When you say you don't like/want kids:
""But you used to be one""
""Oh, you'll change your mind one day""
""But it's selfish not to have one""
""You must be a sociopath.""

When you say you do like/want kids:
""Okay, no explanation needed""

Am I the only one getting tired of having to give everyone an excuse?"
7027,2014-10-28 20:32:20,"Every time anyone gets an ""A"" on a test on our floor, we all high-five dicks. #B1W"
7028,2014-10-28 20:19:21,"I feel stuck and trapped in my old friend group, and I don't know how to make new friends. It may be too late for me. It's not that I dislike my friends, but I don't feel especially close to them. There's so much pressure to make your best, longest lasting friends here, but there's almost no one I feel really close too. I'm worried that I'll graduate with no close friends then go into the real world where it's even harder to meet people and be even more alone. :("
7029,2014-10-28 20:10:22,"as much as i love my sorority, there are certain things that really bother me about greek life. frats and sororities seem to garner certain stereotypes that sort of repeat themselves and i don't always know if i like what im representing"
7030,2014-10-28 20:55:24,"I put a jelly bean in my butt, East campus is a fun place!"
7031,2014-10-28 20:39:25,"I live in Baker House and am in sorority. I go out all the time and feel like I know a lot of people here at MIT, but I honestly can't name one person who lives in East Campus or Senior Haus. Who are the people that live there?? I never see them!"
7032,2014-10-27 10:26:26,"I have a crush on this girl, but I don't know if it's because I really like her or because I'm feeling lonely after my long term girlfriend broke up with me. It also feels too soon to start dating again, given how long my ex and I dated. I don't know what to think..."
7033,2014-10-27 10:09:27,My roommate's mother walked in on me watching porn. Yay for Family Weekend!
7034,2014-10-27 10:53:28,"I've devoted so much time to work this semester that I feel like I haven't spent any time doing the things that I love, and that I don't have time for the people I love. This is really sad for me, because I was really excited about returning to MIT this year and seeing all of my friends again. I compare myself as I am now - working like crazy, catching barely any sleep and just dying - to how happy I was 2 months ago, and it couldn't be more different. Plus my depression is returning and I'm barely making it through the day. I feel like I picked the wrong school because I ultimately believe that life here is meant to be about much more than your profession, and although I have the skills to make it here, I couldn't see a starker contrast between me and those people who enjoy working so much that they make it their lives here. I feel like shit."
7035,2014-10-27 10:42:31,Plot twist: Your big isn't literally the best ever
7036,2014-10-27 10:23:32,"I just had wine and emailed my TA with a full-out shitstorm about how poorly-written the problem sets are, and how he needs to hold himself to the same standards to which he holds his students.

Welp."

7038,2014-10-27 10:13:35,Am I the only freshman who feels like they didn't spend their first two months like they should've?
7039,2014-10-27 10:58:38,"Even though she caught me once and bought a new one, I'm still using my roommate's (new) toothbrush to masturbate."
7040,2014-10-27 10:46:39,"I see what KS is trying to do with their ""My frat sucKS balls"" shirt, but I feel like there are better ways of making fun of PBE than saying that your own frat sucks"
7041,2014-10-27 10:28:41,I've been trying to ask my tinder matches for their credit score to make sure that they are fiscally responsible but none of them will share it with me. All I want is a nice girl who can take care of her own finances. Is that too much to ask? Any MIT girls know how to not fall behind on their credit card payments?
7042,2014-10-27 10:12:50,so i just got a flu shot and the needle penetrated my arm first the tip and then the rest of the shaft  and in that moment i was the luckiest person alive it felt so BEAUTIFUL i was being injected with SCIENCE and i just wanted to weep i sat in the chair and the chair didn’t collapse because some people engineered it and why did they go through all that trouble like they had to design it and get the materials and stuff to make it and there were different people who had to mine the aluminum or whatever and i was sitting my ass on it and thinking of all the people around me in this orderly line to get pricked and the logistics and HOLY SHIT all the people it took to make that vaccine and all the people it took to streamline that process to make that oozing magic syrup and the fact that they have to fucking synthesize a new one each year and all the people before them who figured out stuff about viruses and nucleic acids and stuff and how far they had come from the beginnings of germ theory and holy shit to figure that out that had to do chemistry and stuff toiling that we might not suffer and even those people were standing on giants' shoulders and it's all because of science which is really just a word for being honest and being willing to admit it when you’re proven wrong ‘cause it’s the truth that matters and you have to work together since you can’t do it alone just like the people who made the chair and you have to trust that the others are behaving in good faith and how is this even fucking possible it’s a fucking positive sum game and you fucking BET we’re going to hit that herd immunity threshold it’s CIVILIZATION how lucky lucky am i and you too and i wonder if civilization is still in its infancy but holy fuck holy fuck against the staggering staggering odds how far yes just how far our pathetic pathetic little species has come

7046,2014-10-27 10:08:55,"Everybody seems to always be talking about how academically overwhelmed they are at MIT. I'm not overwhelmed academically. But I want to scream at these people, at least you have friends. And people who will support you in talking about being overwhelmed. I'm that kid who always appears to be coasting and acing life, but if I say so everyone will hate me, so I just say I'm busy, just like everyone else. In reality I don't have any close friends and my life is pretty unsatisfying. I missed out on making a lot of close friendships my freshman year due to relationships and other things. I'm in a fucking sorority, but when I walk into a room full of my sisters, I realize that hardly any of them are really my friends. I say hi to some of them in the hallways and that's about it. Some of them look the other way when I walk past. I would disaffiliate, but I'm so close to the end now that it seems like a waste of years of dues money not to become a lifetime member. I get really happy and really sad every time I think about graduating because I'm so happy to get out of this place where I have no friends, but so sad because I expected to make the best friends of my life here. Yes, it's probably largely my fault for being bad at reaching out to people, but seriously? Not one person has noticed that I'm desperately lonely and have been since the start?"

I know it just takes time to get closer to people and figure out which people I'm able to connect with best, but I have a lot of trouble putting myself out there and meeting new people when I don't have one or two people I'm really close/intimate with.

I hope that these deaths at MIT end...the realization that what happens in your life has an impact on several others is very important."

I'm doing pretty well in my classes, but I always mess up during interviews and it seems like there's no room for error. Is anyone else failing as much as I am?"

7079,2014-10-15 13:26:10,"My ex-boyfriend (not an MIT student, lives 3 hours away) had a mental breakdown and started to believe that he is the Antichrist. He's currently in a mental facility being held against his will because he drove to my hometown and started screaming about it being the devil's den, but I'm so scared that when he gets out he's going to try to kill people. I think I'm on the list, but I'm more afraid he's going to do a mass shooting.
I have spoken to the police, they were instrumental in having him committed for 72+ hours in a special facility (instead of spending only 48 hours in the hospital). But he hasn't made any explicit threats, so no crime has been committed aside from maybe disturbing the peace.
I can't believe this is happening in my life. I'm sitting here working on psets, as if there wasn't a person merely hours away who's locked up, violently deluded, and probably growing more and more angry with every passing minute. At least they can sedate him so he can sleep for the first time in a long time…but I don't think he will be cured before he's released."
7080,2014-10-15 13:12:12,I hate the fact that people running for positions in the freshmen class thought it would be a good idea to friend people on Facebook in order to get votes. The person I voted for president was the one person who didn't send me a spammy friend request. Some of them even sent more friend requests after I deleted them. I also may or may not have reported their profiles to facebook as spam.
7081,2014-10-09 16:22:13,I really wish people could talk about things other than how many tests and psets they have that week. It gets really boring after awhile.
7082,2014-10-09 16:11:14,"I don't think I'm good enough to be here. I'm behind in a class I really care about, and the professor just emailed me to ask why I've missed so many lectures...I'm tired all the time, physically and mentally, and there are days where I just hole myself up in my room and try to finish the piled-up work I have. How do people even have time for things like HackMIT and TechX projects? As much as I want to make cool projects, I'm already weighed down so much by my classes.

I wish I could catch a break, but weekends have turned into workdays too. As soon as I finish one pset, the next one is due tomorrow. I don't have time to breathe, but everyone around me seems to be chugging along just fine...

Definitely not good enough."
7083,2014-10-09 16:50:15,"I feel guilty that my boyfriend cares about me, instead of about someone who is in greater need of that care and affection. I found out yesterday that the girl he used to date in high school had physically abusive parents (abusive to each other and their kids) and I feel like he should have stayed with her, even though he broke up with her (because of distance) long before I met him. But surely she deserved someone who is loving and affectionate more than I do, given that situation.  I felt sufficiently guilty after finding this out that I couldn't sleep last night and therefore barely made it through an 8:30am class."
7084,2014-10-09 16:39:16,I hate it when we get to pick our own teams because my all my friends have people they'd rather work with than me.

7086,2014-10-09 16:01:19,"For the past year, I've considered converting to a new religion, and in the past few months I've begun.  Why am I so desperate to keep this a secret?  Because where I come from, people's decisions get misinterpreted all the time, and the bigger the decision, the more stinging the backlash from your peers.
Just so certain people who might know me don't misjudge me or take this the wrong way: This has NOTHING to do with you.  I've had this connection to the Jewish experience and religion since I was 12 or 13.  It's just that I've only recently been able to figure out what it means and what to do with it.  I can't help that my timing sucks.  I can't help that I fell into an exhausted and dehydrated sleep Saturday night and had to stay up late because of it.  I can't help how scared and nervous I feel when I see people I know when I'm going to a synagogue.  I can't help that this semester feels harder than it should be because of the 18+ units spent researching this, going to services, and reflecting on where I want to go from here.  I can't help that I sometimes sit in my room and cry because the world has butchered and persecuted these people for so many centuries and for no reason.
This process is fucking hard, but I love what I've learned and who I've met and who I've become because of it.  I just wish I had the courage to open up and not do this alone."
7087,2014-10-09 16:48:20,"Sometimes I get jealous of the little kids I see in the playground outside Stata D-Entrance.

I'm not ready to be an adult."
7088,2014-10-09 16:33:21,There's a pretty strong inverse relationship between my mental health and the number of psets I've punted.
7089,2014-10-09 16:18:22,"I'm supposed to grade ~75 problem sets in a week, where each pset has about 5-10 pages of work. I just can't give each student enough time, and I'm scared that I'm giving bad scores. The guilt of this is actually painful."
7090,2014-10-09 16:07:24,"To all the people who wanted to go to MIT to do something good for the world:
You already have that power, right now, as students.
It's easy to be bitter in a place like this, but just showing someone kindness, whether or not they are a friend, makes this place more rewarding.
I feel like once a few years have gone by a lot of us lose sight of that. 
Keep doing nice things, it doesn't take that much time or effort, and we can turn this place around."

7093,2014-10-09 16:18:27,"I think its important for people at MIT to realize that while things at MIT are difficult and all of us feel like a complete loser for a large fraction of our time here, the bigger picture is much brighter. Firstly, a Prof at MIT said that if you're at MIT, you must be doing something right. Also, if we step out of MIT, we can clearly see how much better our education here is compared to other schools. I know, coz I'm a grad student who did undergrads elsewhere. 
One thought I really feel like sharing: if you keep failing at something,it doesn't mean you're a failure. It just means that you're supposed to succeed at something else. A lot of us are bad at accepting failure. For example, not matter how much Stephen Hawking may want to be an athlete, the truth is he has to accept that he can't be and cherish his talent in Science."

The Boston bombings didn't influence me either, even when I knew people affected. I have to avoid talking about tragedies with people, because I can't tell where the line is where people generally start becoming upset. And I don't know whether to feel grateful or miserable that I don't feel someone else's pain the way you do."
7100,2014-10-01 17:12:39,I broke the November Rule already.
7101,2014-10-01 17:55:41,"So..the article ""Drunk female guests are the gravest threat to Fraternities"" has sparked a lot of conversation and anger.  And so has the response ""Fraternities are their own worst enemies, not Drunk Girls.""  

I'm going to be brutally honest.  I'm a girl, and I actually agreed with a lot of the things that Bill Frezza was talking about.  He went a little overboard on points, but in light of the LCA incident and the frat ban now and last year, he was probably a bit worked up about everything and said things he probably regrets.  

Outside of MIT is a different story, but within our school, I believe that a lot of frats here really do try to follow the basic rules.  Yeah, they're going to have alcohol, but when it comes to the serious situations of rape and sexual assault, the fraternity as a whole is not going to encourage and support those kinds of behavior.  I think what Frezza was trying to say was that fraternities have control over themselves, but not their guests--and there's a larger consequence if something happens to a guest that is a female (which is a whole different topic).  There's a potential for a lot of misunderstandings that could blow up into things that could bring down the frat.  

I'm not talking about sexual assault or rape cases. That's the fault of the person who committed those actions (but still not the fraternity as a whole).  I'm talking about people who are intoxicated who make poor decisions because of their state and end up hurting themselves and blaming the frat. Most of us have been to a frat party.  There's a lot of people to watch out for, and a situation like that is really hard to prevent.  And unfortunately, the situation is a lot worse if that accident happens to a girl rather than a guy.  Politically that's just how it is.  

And let's be honest, the response article was a dramatic, exaggeration of the LCA situation.  ""an intoxicated girl 'danced out' a frat house window, thereby ruining the party.  I'm pretty sure the brothers, all the other frats, and the rest of campus took that more seriously than a party buzzkill."

Sometimes I don't realize how overwhelmed I am until I see one of your posts, and experience the really foreign feeling of grinning ear-to-ear. Trying to remember the last time I laughed really hard at something reminds me that life is too short to let myself get bogged down by all the stresses in my life. 

Thank you for that."
7105,2014-10-01 17:14:54,"dear freshmen, I'm incredibly proud of you and your mommy probably is too for getting an a on your first college exam ever, but please refrain from putting that shit all over facebook."

My parents are going through struggles of their own that make me so guilty for being here and unable to help. Then Phoebe. I can't sleep, I don't want to talk to anyone, I feel like collapsing and screaming all the time, but I can't even get myself to cry it out. Meanwhile school work keeps piling and it's getting out of hand, I'm not able to do justice to the people in the extracurricular activities I'm in. Being around people stresses me out, and I just want to be left alone, but at the same time it's so lonely. I think I just want to curl up and go to sleep for a long time."

I constantly feel pressured to be like my hall mates, do what they do, say what they say and act 'cool', even though i don't even know what 'cool' is.

This is a time where they should be figuring out how to work, and P/NR gives a safety net , not an excuse to punt.

7156,2014-05-23 12:39:32,I failed my only final. :(
7157,2014-05-23 12:24:33,"Everyone I know seems to have it so together, and I thought I did too, but I failed most of my classes this semester. I thought I was doing well. I'm going to lose all my scholarships, and now I have to deal with the tornado that is my failing relationship with my parents. I have so much to do, and I just want to crawl under my blankets and sleep for a thousand years."

I'm a guy."
7159,2014-05-23 12:48:38,"Every time I open Grade Report, my impostor syndrome gets worse from seeing all the failing grades. I can't even talk about this with my girlfriend, because she's in worse shape than me. What the fuck am I supposed to do?"
7160,2014-05-23 12:16:39,The tourist groups during finals week need to be banned.
7161,2014-05-23 12:05:41,albert meyer did us dirty on the 6.042 final. it ain't right
7162,2014-05-23 12:52:50,"042 ..... WTF?????? AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH.
Giving us twice the problems with like 4 times in depth in only twice the normal time ..... REALLLY?????????????????"
7163,2014-05-23 12:18:51,"I don't want to go to my internship this summer. The other interns are a bunch of assholes. Some of them contacted me, and I was friendly, but if I could not help them exactly the way they wanted me to, they were just rude. I contacted others with simple questions, and they did not reply, but they replied to the messages of other people...."
7164,2014-05-23 12:04:52,"The way I remember conservation of momentum for fluid mechanics: when giving head, you must use the right pressure and velocity with your tongue while varying elevation accordingly."
7165,2014-05-23 12:46:54,"I know a girl who will be moving to my EC hall next semester, who ""has no filter,"" who seems to think that it's her worst fault.  I don't think she realizes just how much I envy, respect, and love this about her.  It helps her somehow stay positive and smiling and energetic no matter how much shit gets thrown at her and no matter how hosed she gets.  I wish I knew where this strength comes from because fuck knows I need it."
7166,2014-05-23 12:36:55,"MJ said that you miss a 1,000% of the shots you dont take. I'm always down for shots."

7169,2014-05-23 12:49:10,I brought this chick back from dayglow. She looked like she was 15 but she moved like she was 18.

7171,2014-05-23 12:50:13,"The hair of my mustache are so long that reach into my mouth. That's why when I introduce myself to girls, I call myself the ""Walrus"""
7172,2014-05-23 12:26:14,"To the priveleged: remember that people have the right to speak out about their struggles. To the non-priveleged: remember that even priveleged people have struggles, albeit lesser ones, and see my previous point. Also, I really wish I didn't have to dichotomize into priveleged and non-priveleged, because it's not us and them. It's all of us together, especially at a place like MIT."
7173,2014-05-23 12:11:15,"To 1270. I know who you are. I saw you some weeks ago. I wasn't going to say anything because I thought that you would change, but now that I see that you are even proud of it (putting it on MIT confessions), I want to help you and  share your pride with everyone. So I have some announcements with your picture, a picture of how you leave the toilets and a sentence that reads ""I don't know how to flush the toilet, can you teach me?""
I plan to distribute it throughout MIT if you leave that nasty stuff again.
Glad that you are proud of your disgusting behavior, makes this so much easier.
Thanks!"
7174,2014-05-23 12:48:16,"I'm not sure if #1288 is directed at me, or it is just a similar case. But, in case it is, I would like to state this publicly (because the current couple of comments and 21 likes on that post piss me off). The truth is, you did things to me I had explicitly requested you not to do. Regardless of whether or not I slept with other people, this is bad. Although I don't care that much because it didn't end up resulting in pregnancy, I almost feel the responsibility to speak up/stand up for other women who may place more emotional/psychological value in sex. The reason I am keeping this secret in real life is purely for your sake, so if you keep that attitude up and piss me off more, maybe I WILL speak out. (and when I say, I don't care that much, I mean now that I know I'm not pregnant. The during the couple of weeks of absolute terror, I did care)
Now, regarding cheating, the agreement was don't ask, don't tell, and pretend I'm yours. You asked and gave me no choice but to tell. I wouldn't have told you otherwise."
7175,2014-05-23 12:08:17,"I've been at MIT too long: I see times and dates as course numbers. 5/12 and 5/13? Flashbacks to panicking at seeing a molecule I can't possibly synthesize. 8:01 pm? Haha, glad I'm done with that confidence-sucking GIR. 10:10? Yay, glad I don't have to take that class."
7176,2014-05-23 12:58:19,"The time I realized that I was an MIT student: The words ""derivative,"" ""differentiate,"" and ""equivalence,"" were the most used vocabulary terms in my HASS essay."
7177,2014-05-23 12:36:20,"Sometimes I question the people I am friends with. I generally like them but man sometimes I feel like I hate them, and it is for no particular reason... I guess I just feel like the only reason I am friends with them is to not be alone. But is that friendship?"

7179,2014-05-23 12:01:22,"I don't really know how to meet someone to start a relationship. I've never dated anyone before, and I feel like I'm really missing out on something special. No one has ever showed even the slightest interest in me, though, and I feel like no one will ever love me in that way."
7180,2014-05-23 12:46:24,"I'm only accommodating to my more politically-correct friends because I don't want to be socially ostracized. Honestly, I want to syntactically shovel shit into their ears until the only option for them is to go tribal on my dumb ass."
7181,2014-05-23 12:17:25,"I use my brass rat as a cock ring.
I didn't get it refitted."

It's gotten to a point that I don't feel like my body is my own anymore.  It's weird.  Everything is so surreal."
7183,2014-05-23 12:49:27,"Disappointed at the lack of new confessions on here. Come on, people! We have procrastinating on studying for finals to do!"
7184,2014-05-23 12:25:28,I think I have Phi Sig Fever
7185,2014-05-23 12:10:31,I feel like a pathetic desperate teenage girl chasing you when there are so many guys willing to chase me. What is wrong with me? I need summer to get here pronto.
7186,2014-05-11 17:36:32,"You know those insecure people who always tell one-up stories, put down others, and dismiss everything as lame? So annoying..."
7187,2014-05-11 17:26:33,Most of the time MIT seems like a pretty good size for a school but when you drunkenly hook up with somebody and never want to see them again it suddenly becomes really tiny
7188,2014-05-11 17:00:35,"With the really high tree pollen count we've been having over the past few days, I've discovered a surprisingly effective remedy that really clears the sinuses: vigorous masturbation.

(Obviously actual sex works too, something about the hormones, but let's be real here, if you've as much snot gushing out of your nose as I do, your odds of getting laid are about the same as the NRA endorsing Obama)"
7189,2014-05-11 17:46:38,Is a D in 6.01 passing? What if I'm 6-3?
7190,2014-05-11 17:01:39,"It is fucking comical how a few people who fall into some sort of minority group think that they're entitled to be unaccepting assholes... and if anyone calls them out on it, they claim that those people can't do that because somehow that indicates a generalization that the whole minority group consists of assholes. Equality is not about going out on a crusade to even out how many wrongs each side has done. Let's take a classic example: just because you're a girl doesn't mean you should treat guys like shit. Just because someone hurt you doesn't mean you get to advocate for the person who looks the most like you because it's ""more likely"" that they were the one who got hurt. That shit is the reason feminist has devolved into a label I'd rather not have. And that's really, really sad, because so much could be done if we could all calm the fuck down."
7191,2014-05-11 17:48:41,"''Hey I just met you, and this is crazy, I think youre preety, so anal maybe'' is my most used pickup line on MIT girls. All I can say is that MIT girls are freaks."
7192,2014-05-11 17:34:50,"Hey member of whatever team that practices until 2ish in the Dance Studio, next time you use the bathroom in McC, take care to listen to the sounds around you. I'm pretty sure I peed loud enough, but if that's not a clear enough message, just realize there's someone else in the stall next to you before you go and turn the damn lights off."
7193,2014-05-11 17:14:51,"I made a mistake last semester. It nearly cost me my year at MIT. I feel so shitty just thinking about it. Though I managed not to lose a whole year, I did lose my friends. I wish I could redo it - but I can't. Thing is, I can't move on if you won't too; the pitiful look on your face everytime you see me kills me inside."
7194,2014-05-11 16:49:52,"my boyfriend is so liberal, even his dick leans left."
7195,2014-05-11 16:36:54,"Maybe I am in the minority:I thought the Fossil Free MIT blue ribbon tape was a pretty neat and effective way to broadcast their message. It certainly caught my attention. It was big and bold and impossible to avoid. I thought it was wasteful at first. Sure, they could have done something else, but any complaining about the blue ribbon tape is, I feel, quite unjustified. The only reason I see people complaining is because they are an environmental group; I am sad to see that the same people are not complaining about the yellow ribbon MIT Facilities puts up on Kresge nearly every week, in an absolutely futile attempt to keep the grass green. It is akin to criticizing them for putting up copious amounts of paper to broadcast their events, just like every single other student group on campus. Are we to restrict this group, that is fighting to combat global climate change, to solely forms of communication that in no way affect the environment? If you have to use a few trees, or use a few gallons of gas, in order to save billions of trees and human life as we know it, by all means, you have my blessing.

Thank you, Fossil Free MIT. I am not a member, but your display brought a great issue to light. Everyone is talking about it, and even if they are discussing it negatively, at least they are talking about it. Plus, you got a response from President Reif! Go you! Please continue to encourage people to divest from fossil fuels, and make the world a better place. And if you have to use a few yards of blue ribbon tape once every year, by all means, do so: I think the cause you are fighting for is a little bit bigger than a roll of blue ribbon tape.

Peace."
7196,2014-05-11 16:21:55,I spent way too long trying to figure out an 8.02 problem only to realize I was using my left hand....
7197,2014-05-11 16:10:57,"Whenever I write anything down, I talk to myself in a British accent."
7198,2014-05-11 16:00:59,"Honestly, the world's sensitivity has gotten out of hand. All of this uproar about sexism, racism, sexuality, etc has created an environment where cautiousness is valued over expression. Grow some thicker skin. The fact that people complain so much about these topics give the topics power over them. I'm part of a minority group and have heard my fair share of discrimination, but I honestly couldn't care what they.

Are other people's mental psyche so weak that they can't ignore strong words?"
7199,2014-05-11 16:49:10,I hate having to get extensions because of my mental health issues. But it's impossible to get anything done on days when I'm only capable of crying and sleeping
7200,2014-05-11 16:37:12,"All of my friends are bogged down with the idea of failure. They want things fast and now, and they don't understand that the wonderful things they're trying to do take time in which not many will appreciate their work. The lack of immediate success is not equivalent to failure, and I wish they could see that, although I understand that they need to fall upon this realization themselves."
7201,2014-05-11 16:22:13,I told my boyfriend to bite me harder. He wanted to know with how many newtons of force..
7202,2014-05-11 16:11:14,"I kissed and touched one of my best friends, which I had wanted to do for a while... and to be honest, I enjoyed it quite a lot. Now I feel he doesn't want to talk to me anymore, and it breaks my heart to think our friendship is ruined.
:("
7203,2014-05-08 08:03:15,"I hate it when people reply to confessions saying ""Go to MIT Mental Health.""  For two reasons: (1) that advice makes MIT Mental Health seem like a mystical black box in which your problems will be mitigated but it's not as simple as that and perhaps much more importantly (2) I once took that advice and was screwed over for a whole year.  I don't want to go into detail but they made me feel like complete shit.  I thought that maybe my experience was just especially awful but when I talked to friends, they said that they had similar experiences at MIT Mental Health.  I found out later that working it out with my boyfriend's help (who actually cared about me) was a lot better.  Sure, going to MIT Health was a good first step (made me realize I had a problem), it didn't help my problem at ALL.

So maybe try MIT Medical but I would definitely suggest telling some you trust your problems.  Maybe a parent, a sister, a uncle, a good friend, anyone.  It's so much more helpful than telling someone who just wants to check off boxes to diagnose you and throw pills at you."
7204,2014-05-08 08:40:16,"I keep seeing these signs that are by ""Queer West"".  If I called a homosexual a queer, I would be called an intolerant bigot, yet they can post it all over campus.  Political correctness shouldn't be a one way street; either everyone can say it or nobody can."
7205,2014-05-08 08:23:17,"How on earth is 6.005 a 12 unit class? Unless everyone in the class is travelling really fast, why on hell's name isn't it at least 18 units? I feel like it's one class where professors (and TAs) find solace in torturing the students."
7206,2014-05-08 08:08:19,Can I have Will Rutter follow me around and narrate my life? His voice is so gorgeous.
7207,2014-05-08 08:57:20,"I was walking along the Harvard bridge on my way home on Monday.  The sky was blue, the sun was shining--and there was Fossil Free MIT blue tape caught all up in the railing of the bridge and some in the river.  

Congratulations, Fossil Free.  You have successfully pissed off the whole campus."
7208,2014-05-08 08:28:21,"You told me we were exclusive. Then you secretly slept with other guys. And now you're mad that I asked you to stop? Don't accuse me of ""perpetuating rape culture"" and ""not respecting feminist ideals"" when there was an explicit monagamous understanding between us from the beginning. Feminism is about empowerment, equality, and respect - you just use it as a ticket to justify cheating. That kind of bullshit is the reason why no one has any idea what feminism actually stands for."
7209,2014-05-08 08:16:22,"You know how the microwave smells a little weird sometimes?

I wake up early and microwave my boxers when I don't feel like doing laundry. Hygiene is important, folks!"
7210,2014-05-08 08:47:24,"I masturbate while studying. It helps me concentrate.

It's also a great memory aid during exams."
7211,2014-05-08 08:29:25,"Every time I have one submission left on online questions, I am fairly certain of the answer. But that also means I'm slightly uncertain... Crap."
7212,2014-05-08 08:12:26,"Of all the things the internet has gotten me to like ironically and then just plain enjoy unironically (Dubstep, My Little Pony), I have yet to find ass attractive."
7213,2014-05-08 08:48:27,"About 20 minutes ago, someone asked me if I was wearing a corset.  I wasn't wearing one.  Not sure how I feel about this."
7214,2014-05-08 08:33:28,I fight my sexuality every day.
7215,2014-05-08 08:14:31,"There's a guy I know from hanging out on his dorm hall a lot.  He calls everyone (even girls) ""dude.""  Maybe it's just my background/upbringing, but I find this annoying and kind of demeaning.  I'm not the type to call him out on it because it's clearly a habit.  It's just that even when I go out with people during the day (and therefore make an effort to look nice/kind of feminine with flattering clothes, makeup, etc), then go hang out on the hall right after, I still am addressed as ""dude"" instead of by my name, it hurts.  I know you're a really good person, and I have a lot of respect for you.  I just feel like I don't have your respect when you don't feel the need to call me by my name.  Names exist for a reason.  Use them more often than you do."
7216,2014-05-05 22:03:32,f our best confessions are featured in the 2014 Technique! Yay us!
7217,2014-05-04 16:19:33,I really liked the arrows/lines along the infinite... Can this be a permanent thing?
7218,2014-05-04 16:38:35,"Sometimes when things aren't going well I just want to pull down my pants and be like ""well at least I have this, bitches"""
7219,2014-05-04 16:06:38,"When I was younger I thought I would never develop an eating disorder because I loved food too much. Little did I know, bulimia is tailor-made for people like me. I need help."
7220,2014-05-04 16:42:39,2.007 taught me that it's better to be a smart quitter than a determined fool.
7221,2014-05-04 16:27:41,"Despite being an environmentalist, I really don't agree with Fossil Free MIT. In particular, their decision to put a blue rope around campus is quite hypocritical and counter productive. Fossil Free MIT seeks to divest MIT away from fossil fuel and promote sustainability yet their blue ropes did just the opposite. 
1) Those blue ropes are mostly made out of petroleum, specifically polypropylene, which uses fossil fuels to produce and transport. 
2) The the extensive use of the tape is wasteful use of resource. If this was a PR stunt, very few people had the time to stop to actually read the text on the tape - most people viewed it as a construction caution tape. People probably viewed it as a nuisance than informative as it was spread all over the place and made our campus look aesthetically displeasing.
3) The tape harms the environment. If Fossil Free MIT cared about sustainability, they should have realized that some of the tape they place came undone and flew away. Much like littering, those tape pieces now have the potential to get stuck around a bird's wing, chock a bird who accidentally swallows it, pollute the Charles River, etc. Considering that the tape was made from petroleum, it most likely will not biodegrade, leading to long term waste. 
It is a shame that Fossil Free MIT cared more about their voice than their actions. Actions speak louder than words. Please don't harm the environment just so you can be heard."

7242,2014-04-21 19:09:26,"Hello everybody. This is MIT speaking. No this is not a troll. Yes, it is actually the entity of MIT/the spirit of MIT/MIT incarnate speaking to you. And I have a motivational message for you.
Message: You should always tell yourself that you are beautiful, strong and capable individuals. Decades of personal observation have shown me that those who try this technique tend to lose hope and become sleep-deprived, emotionless, heartless social outcasts much slower than the rest of us do here, even though you all will get to that at some point. But you should disregard the fact that I, MIT, will screw you and believe that you are strong, beautiful and capable, even though you aren't. I just wanted to inspire you to believe that you are capable of overcoming any of the various difficulties I have designed to break your spirit, though in fact you never will. Anyways, keep smiling that big smile of yours, which incidentally makes you seem ignorant of all the devils and plagues of thirst, hunger and p sets that I have lined up fr you, and have a great day!
MIT over and out"
7243,2014-04-21 19:44:27,"Am I the only one extremely annoyed with this ""sleep is for the strong"" campaign? They've been spamming everywhere about it multiple times, and have signs everywhere.

What are they actually hoping to accomplish? Awareness isn't going to do anything about the fact that MIT is hard, it's the toughest school in the world for a reason. I chose to go to this school because of the challenge, and accept the fact that ""sleep is for the weak"". Focusing your time into this campaign is, in my opinion, a waste of time."

The way they went through pictures of their time together, fondly recollecting their memories honestly left me a little jealous, and made me feel like I was intruding. I’m not saying I don’t have any friends, but I wish I had relationships like that, it must be a very happy way to live."
7251,2014-04-18 23:04:41,"Seriously, I hate the UGC.  Why are we forced to donate to an organization when honestly my only affiliation to them is them wasting my time telling me about we do.  It's not that I have a problem donating to the different projects that the public service center funds, but when you waste my time trying to talk to me when I'm trying to get to class or lunch it really makes me not care about the cause. In fact, it really irritates me.  I'm not against public service, in fact I'm in support of it.  But a donation is not a donation if you're being almost harassed if you don't do it."

7258,2014-04-18 23:42:59,"I feel pretty dumb for having to drop an intro class my freshman spring. And because of the credit limit, I'm down to 42 units. I feel like it puts me behind in my plans since I'll have to retake it later (it's a req for my potential major), and it makes me wish I'd started the semester differently. I wish I'd taken advantage of P/NR by finding out how much I could handle and developing good study habits. I wish I'd prepared over IAP, and I wish I hadn't started to procrastinate the very first day. I feel like I'm STILL in the process of figuring out what works for me, and it took a toll on my performance. I don't want to wish all these things because there's no use in wishing, but I can't help but let it bother me. I don't want it to bother me because there's nothing I can do about it now. But it does."
7259,2014-04-18 23:30:10,"The most valuable lesson I've learned in college (so far) is that the key to moving forward is learning when to take a step back. Taking the extra time to introspect allows you to better visualize your future, and it often lets you explore doors to amazing possibilities you might never have considered otherwise. To all my fellow peers who have ever felt hopelessly behind or incompetent in TFP in any way, I encourage you to treat your MIT experience (and beyond) not as a race, but as a marathon. It's been said before, but truly each and every one of you is here for a reason-- not just for what you've accomplished, but for your potential. If you take the time to appreciate and believe in your own potential, no firehose will ever be powerful enough to knock you down."
7260,2014-04-18 23:51:12,Dear people currently taking 7.013 it is a common courtesy in a lecture hall to shut the fuck up when the teacher is talking.

7261,2014-04-18 23:37:13,"A friend of mine died almost a year ago. He killed himself a week or so after the bombings. I know it wasn't my fault but I should have been a better friend and been there for him when he needed.

Almost a year later, and I still have recurring nightmares that his ghost is haunting me. 

I feel like I should tell someone, but I don't want my family to worry and few of my friends even know this happened. I'm afraid if I tell anyone they'll tell me to go to Mental

7264,2014-04-16 20:56:16,"people don't like it when I make comments about the confessions, but I can't just sit back on this one. I think we all have a right to be upset about what happened a year ago yesterday. The bombings happened right across the river in the city we currently live in. Of course we're going to want to help out as much as we can; we feel like we relate to this incident more. Sure, there have been situations overseas that have led to more casualties, but god damn man, just because we don't personally know victims of the bombings doesn't mean we aren't #BostonStrong. Get your head out of your ass and let us, as a school and as a city, come together. Don't tell us what to do.

The 'confession' is posted below. As always, feel free to comment/debate. 

Personally, the bombings last year (since they happened 20 minutes after I left the finish line where I was watching the marathon), made me realize that life is precious and short, and that I shouldn't take anything for granted. So, excuse me for wanting to be #BostonStrong.

Also, don't talk shit about this amazing country we live in. Merica.

#1233 'Can we take a moment to see why the world hates America so much?

4 people died. Dozens were injured. #BostonStrong was the most tweeted hashtag for weeks after the event. The One Fund raised over $100 million to support the victims. New Balance is advertising their new ""Boston"" shoes. Someone at Wellesley wrote a song commemorating the occasion, and 100 people sang it on the radio.

Now imagine watching all this from the point of view of a man in Syria who just lost his home and family in a bombing. Or from the POV of a Sudanese boy whose arm was cut off via machete by rebel forces. Or from the POV of a human trafficking victim who gets raped every day. Or from the POV of a Vietnamese slave working in triple digit weather building skyscrapers in Dubai.

And not to mention: most MIT kids don't even know a victim of the bombings. Most of you sat at home watching the TV while police led a wild goose chase for 2 small time terrorists. Please tell me how you are #BostonStrong.

Tragedies happen every day. What happened to quiet resilience? What happened to keeping your head down and moving on with life when bad things happen?

Americans are the best in the world at blowing smoke up their own arses. But hey, whatever makes you feel important. #BostonStrong #BornInTheUSA'"

If they showed the prefrosh a good time, that's going to get them more excited about MIT. If guys want to join their fraternity because of how good of a time they had there, then that's their decision. Everyone wants to be in a fraternity they can enjoy and be proud of. I know a lot of us ""dislike"" their CPW shirts, but I have had conversations with guys in a couple fraternities (LCA and Phi Sig specifically) and we agreed it's only because they are better than our own. We all joined greek life for some reason, and all greek life improves this school. There's no reason to shit on each other. To guys in PBE, congrats on a very exciting CPW weekend.

Why are there so many people in direct violation of the elbow rule?? If my elbow is trying to regain lost ground by pushing against your elbow, person sitting next to me in lecture, don't dig your elbow in deeper, MOVE YOUR FUCKING ELBOW. Don't even get me started about foot space. JUST KEEP YOUR FUCKING ELBOWS TO YOUR MOTHERFUCKING SELF."

My logic is that maybe if they're not completely surrounded by misery and psets and exams looming on the horizon, they'll feel a little better and be happier/more productive.
But when I crack, I really REALLY crack.  I get sad, I cry a little, I hate everything, I isolate myself or calmly tell people I can't avoid that I just don't want to see anyone right now.  The people I hold close to me are suddenly fucking annoying.  I get jealous of people who are more hosed because I feel like they're smarter than me for taking harder classes, and I get jealous of people who are less hosed than me because they can handle their shit better than I can.  The only person who's seen me crack is someone who doesn't even go here and is in another country right now but still loves me to death.  I'm afraid of cracking again and not having anyone to help me through it when I need someone."

I'd rush doing my P-sets and Labs so that I could do something amazing with her.

Then, this semester, everything changed. She would just ignore me, and get angry at me for no reason. She would ignore me, make me suffer and cry, and never say sorry. She really made me sad. We broke up a while ago and don't talk to each other anymore. 

I feel kinda lost, and all the energy that I had for P-sets and Labs are gone. Even though it is silly, I'd do them earlier and faster to stay with her. Now I can't see a reason to do them... Not doing them make me worried, and by being worried about them, I don't get worried about all my other problems [one of the reasons I liked to be with her was to forget the world for a while...]."

They've never ever asked me what my UROP is on, or what I want to do after MIT, much less anything else. I'm a senior, and these are my ""closest"" friends."

It's Ivy day, and my friends are all getting into most of the schools they applied to, but I've only been rejected. I've even gotten rejected from a couple schools that are supposed to be much less selective than MIT. 

Honestly, I’m not as smart as my friends. I don’t try as hard on every little assignment. I’m even having trouble coherently writing this post. I don’t feel like I deserve to be admitted. It feels like all my (very few) accomplishments are hollow. Lots of my A’s were borderline and probably should have been B’s, all I really did was dink around in my oh-so desirable lab job, and I’m not even that good at the sport I was recruited for. And now that some of my friends admitted to MIT are treating it like its nothing, just another option they are hardly considering, and that I was only admitted because I’m an athlete… I don’t know what to think. 

Everyone has been talking about imposter syndrome and that we all belong here for a reason. I feel like whatever MIT thinks my reason is, whether it is athletics or extracurricular activities or academics, I still don’t deserve to be at a place as great as MIT."

I'm tired of these constant reminders of my inferiority and stupidity. With every rejection, I feel less like the brass rat I'm about to earn means anything to me anymore, and I don't think I deserve it. I just want assurance, plans to have, and instead I have the fear that I'll never catch up embracing me."

There is not one thing that I can do right. Everywhere I go, I am the butt of other people's jokes. I am running out of things to cling on to. Some people struggle academically but have a large support group, while others excel in their fields but might feel lonely. I'm a complete failure, academically and socially.

Also, why would they limit the dates when we can use guest passes, they conveniently do not let us use them during orientation, when many of us have our family visiting. I tried to tell this to MIT housing and they told me they couldn't do anything about it!!! We, as students, did not looked for bon appetit; we were obligated to have a meal plan, so it is MIT housing's responsibility to make sure that they give us a fair deal. We should get together and maybe then, it will not only be one student's complaint, but a real issue among MIT students."

To tell the truth, I'm a pretty average girl who worked really hard and got really lucky. I'm really grateful to be at MIT, but I feel really bad about all the people who accomplished more than me and didn't get in. I kind of feel like the only reason I got in is because I'm a girl."

It's nothing personal - it's just that I'm doing everything I need to to maximize the material I learn when I am in study mode. I think the problem is me - I've always been the kind of student who needs to repeat a problem -10 extra times before I get it. I was the slowest student in my high school AP classes and I feel like I'm still the slowest student here. It's disheartening to watch all your other friends understand it the first or second time around, but it's something I've grown to accept. Also, seeing reactions or patterns in my classes isn't intuitive to me as professors often say. Perhaps, I do understand the reactions/patterns/math/etc.; I'll feel proud of myself, and I'll feel confident about taking that test. But if that professor places it on the test with an extra (by extra I mean huge) twist, you can bet your dog biscuits I will not see it - I'll try to, but I won't think of it there on the spot.

It's not laziness.

Listen, white or not white, we all have struggles. And I know you feel hated on because everyone says you get special treatment and all minorities are oppressed because of it, and they're totally milking it and blah blah blah.
But just imagine--with all the hardships that EVERYONE has to go through, it would be nice for people of color to not get judged simply for being of color. To not be doubted on a daily basis about their intellectual ability because ""they're only here because of affirmative action."" It would be nice to not get looked at funny when you go to a store and are followed around by (usually white) employees because not being white apparently makes you a shoplifter. It'd be nice to walk down a street without people clutching their purses or children closer, or CROSSING THE FUCKING STREET because they're scared to pass you because you're not white so you MUST be a criminal. It would be nice to not have to worry about your parents being discriminated against and not realizing it because you're not there to understand when someone throws racial slurs at them and since they don't understand because English just happens to be a bitchy language to learn, all they can do is smile and greet them. Or to be worried that you're not there to translate your younger siblings' school papers to them so they don't always know what's going on. Is it really too much to ask to be treated fairly? I mean, look at what society is calling people of color. MINORITIES. They are automatically labeled as something INFERIOR. 
So please. If you're gonna go complaining because you're always seen as just another good citizen while people of color are constantly being accused of being criminals of the world for not having been born white, or because on top of all your other problems you AT LEAST have to deal with people seeing you as THE MINORITY--go do it with other privileged human beings and stop asking the people that are currently on the short end of the stick to feel sorry for you. And if you're trolling, go make yourself useful and do something nice for people for a change. The world is fucked up enough without you making people's lives even more annoying to deal with.

7395,2014-02-27 10:21:31,"white privilege, critical race theory and all the RACIST garbage like it, is meant to assign collective guilt and personal responsibility to all white people for the crime of being white in their own countries, cultures and societies. it becomes especially important a fiction when black racists have so little to actually point to.

it turns the reality of being a minority in a white society into instant victimization. this is racism that non-whites can enjoy, this is something created and scripted by WHITE LIBERALS first and foremost.

its no accident that the solution for ""white privilege"" just so happens to be white liberal ideology... its no accident that black racists are blind to their own indoctrination and servility.

affirmative action, entitlement programs and the like... the ONLY institutionalized racism that actually does exist, becomes the means in which black support is guaranteed. racism under the guise of ""social justice""

there is no Asian privilege in predominantly Asian countries.

there is no mestizo privilege in predominantly mestizo countries.

there is no black privilege in predominantly black countries.

anything, but ANYTHING you can attempt to describe as white privilege is seen and repeated in ALL non-white societies. but the very concept itself IS ONLY APPLIED to predominantly white countries, cultures and societies. being white makes you GUILTY. simply existing makes you GUILTY.

it is purely RACIST.

again.. it exists to ASSIGN COLLECTIVE GUILT on people who have harmed no one, who have committed no crime. it is used to justify collective responsibility on people simply for existing. its meant to provide JUSTIFICATION for racist policies and attitudes AGAINST THEM.

all of it, hinges on the idea that there is no such thing as white culture, communities, societies. that white people ""take for granted"" that they can walk out the door, go to work, the store, a club and expect to see people who like like themselves.

this is what white people ""take for granted"".... white people walk out the door and ""should"" expect to see black, asians, mestizos, arabs ...every race and creed. the very idea that white people expect to live in their own racial society, culture, and community makes them GUILTY of something."

How I could be in such close proximity to someone who could be so special to me. How somewhere in that room I could find love.

But I don't know anybody. We may mostly all be freshmen but I feel like I know only 5% of my class, if even. And somewhere out there is somebody who would bring so much beauty to my life, someone whom I've yet to meet.

I try to meet new people. I try to go to social events (though I detest parties), and I try to talk to people, but it's so hard. When I talk to someone new, 98% of the time I will never talk to them again. I may have an awesome conversation with someone (guy or girl) for twenty minutes, but if anyone asks for contact information, it's me, and then it's awkward, and then nothing ever comes from that. It seems impossible to truly get to know anyone new. I also feel kind of far from where most interactions happen because of my dorm's location, so 90% of the people I know are from my dorm. I like the people I know but I don't even have a close friend yet, and I feel stuck, like I've already met pretty much everyone I'm going to meet throughout my entire time here.

I'm not unhappy, I guess, and I know I don't /need/ love or closer friends, but it's so strange to think that theoretically, every day, I could be passing by in the halls a person that in an alternate universe, if things had happened a bit differently, I would love so much."

Please don't give me this ""it's only your opinion"" crap, because I am already aware of the 99% of people who are reading this who have been brainwashed with this utterly horrid show.

For one I need absolute quiet to be able to focus, and worse, I feel enormous pressure not to ask questions or be slower than other people in the group, especially since I am usually a minority in my classes. I can't tell if I am less intelligent than everyone else or they just hide it better (and I fear that I am making excuses for myself by considering the latter), but I am missing out on too many social opportunities because of this. Next semester I will work much harder to keep up with the coursework so I can get over this problem and have a grasp of the material before going to the study groups."

Bon Appetit has been doing whatever they please, and whenever we approach MIT housing or similar departments, they say they don't have anything to do with it. We didn't go looking for Bon Appetit and hired them, MIT housing made us use its service. Now, MIT's departments should control this business and be willing to help out the students."

7543,2013-12-03 13:54:27,"'m alright most of the time. But there are times when everything is just far too much: all the homework, keeping up my long distance relationship, and still trying to be somewhat social so I don't lose the couple good friends I have? Add trying to figure out what I want to do with my life. I feel like I'm just barely skimming along, getting what I need done but letting anything not on the top of my priority list just be forgotten. I sometimes feel there is no winning."
7544,2013-12-03 13:32:28,"he longer I'm here, the more toxic the atmosphere seems for me.  I love my hall and the people on it, but it doesn't seem to go both ways. I feel like I only ever see what I'm missing. Every time I walk past a room full of laughing people, every time my roommate comes in breathless from her last great adventure, every time people around me make inside jokes about things I wasn’t invited to, it feels like someone is stabbing high school me a dozen times and then kicking me while I’m down. I dreamed college would be a place where I wouldn’t be left out, but that’s just not the case, and I feel the pain more acutely than ever."

7553,2013-11-29 22:05:51,"can't stand hearing people talking about how ""dumb"" other MIT students are. Especially as freshmen, when probably 90% of your scores and apparent strengths are based on high school preparation. Obviously if you already took a college class covering the same material as one of the GIRs you'll have it easier than your classmates. But if you actually were such a genius, you would have passed the ASE. So shut up and realize that you were incredibly lucky to have had a better high school education than 99% of the world, instead of putting everyone else down."
7554,2013-11-29 22:52:52,"ost of my friends are wildly liberal, which is fine because I am too.  I agree with them on most issues related to sexuality/bodily autonomy (marriage equality, the right to choose, etc.), but I have a lot of problems with the sex-positive movement and the kink community.  I'm afraid to share my opinions without being shunned or thought of as a bigot.  It's super frustrating to hear somebody give their point of view and assume I agree when I'm too afraid to speak up.  Why are the most ""tolerant"" people just as intimidating as the ""intolerant"" ones?"

If you don't know what happened to him check this out http://swimswam.com/support-team-theo-everpresent-tiburon-mile/ I wish you all the best, and hope for your safe recovery, even though I never got to meet you before! All the best, and when you get here, I hope I get the chance to meet you!"

But if you don't, I will look for you, I will find you, and I will ban you.
