Why can't people see that I'm an active girl who exercises at least 3 days a week, that every single one my blood test numbers is perfect, that my doctor says I have the heart of a runner instead of the 240lb body that I wear? People like to say weight isn't a factor but that's a lie. And I don't know why I just can't lose it.  *forever fat and alone*
