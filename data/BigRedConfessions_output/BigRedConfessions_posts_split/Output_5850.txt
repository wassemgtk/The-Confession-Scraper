Life is so terribly unfair, and I know because I grew up in the worst environment. I loved you with all of my heart, and I can still hear all of those pretty words you'd whisper as you promised me you would always be faithful. I can still remember how you begged me not to leave, but now I'm here, and your there with your new love. You've done everything you made me promise you I wouldn't do, and what's worse is the fact that I still love you. I must be twisted, but you're a liar and a cheater. I want my heart back, but more than that, I want the two and a half years of my life that I spent with you.
