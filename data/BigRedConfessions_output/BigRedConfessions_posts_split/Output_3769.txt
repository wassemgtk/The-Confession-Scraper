"I hate myself. The way that I entrench myself in unnecessary sadness is not only toxic to my well being, it brings others to my shitty pit as well. I recognize my parasitic qualities, but I can't get myself to stop. I don't mean to do any harm. I don't fucking know. Being miserable is like a comfort blanket for me sometimes. That and I just don't feel like I deserve to be okay, let alone happy. Maybe that's why I get myself into these situations. Maybe I want people to hate me? I just don't know. This is all fucking hard and the fact that I am at Cornell and away from my parents means that I can do whatever I want to myself and that scares me.

 On days like this, I miss my ex like hell. He used to insult me, beat me and force me to do sexual acts with him. It was fucking terrible, but it was secure. As long as I didn't say anything about those things, he would stay with me. In a way, he felt like exactly what I deserved. Exactly. Sometimes I wished that he would get to a point where he would beat me so hard that he would kill me, since I couldn't get myself to do it. I miss it. Now that I am at Cornell, I don't know how to fill in that kind of gap and I have been doing some pretty bad things to try to not feel empty. Not sure if ""bad"" is the word, but I can't think of another one right now.

Sorry for all the rambling, I just typed this all as it came into my head. Actually, fuck saying sorry. I'm probably gonna get some shit for this anyway. I don't why I'm sending this in, but it feels good to begin the process of unjumbling all these feelings and thoughts. "
