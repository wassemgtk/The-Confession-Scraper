I always doubt myself when I get matched with someone on tinder. I never think I'm attractive enough for them to swipe right on me. Sometimes I think it's some douchebag catfishing for the fun of it. Maybe you do have an interest in me. But if I do message you, please message me back with an iota of enthusiasm.
