I'm so miserable. I hate school, I hate my major, I hate my life, I hate the terrible circumstances I'm in. It could be so much worse, but even so my every breath is a sigh or an "UUUUGH."

Maybe only the first sentence was necessary though. I can't properly express my situation or my feelings (or my numbness).
