I'm continually disgusted by the way gay men treat each other, in the real world, because let's be real Cornell is far from it, it happens. But at Cornell, the slut shaming and the complete rudeness and disrespect that gay men show each other at this university is embarrassing. I'm embarrassed to even say I am gay male because I DON'T want to be associated with that type of behavior.

Seriously, love yourself. And then hopefully you'll learn to love and respect others.
