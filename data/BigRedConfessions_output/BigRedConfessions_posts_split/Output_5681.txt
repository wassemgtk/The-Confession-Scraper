You were my best friend for the past two years, but honest to god, I'm really glad we didn't talk as much this semester. It turned out to be one of the best semesters of my life, and I think it's because I wasn't constantly tiptoeing around you and trying to do only things you like for fear of you exploding. I think you got out of your shell too. I just wish we hadn't wasted two years of college before we figured out that all we needed to be happy here was to stop thinking we needed to do things together all the time to be friends.
