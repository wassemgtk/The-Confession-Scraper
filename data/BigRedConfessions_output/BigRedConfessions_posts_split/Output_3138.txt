I want to transfer. I'm not getting the ""college is the best years of your life"" here, which sucks because Cornell is such a good school. In fact, I look forward to breaks just so I can go home. I just don't want to disappoint my parents because they are so happy that I'm at such a good school and want me to stay here. They are so supportive of me which makes it even worse because I don't want to disappoint them. What should I do?
