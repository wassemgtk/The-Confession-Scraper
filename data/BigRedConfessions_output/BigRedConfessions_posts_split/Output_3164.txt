In the past few years I've really started to realize how great my mother is. She was born and raised in China, and left the country after my dad was accepted to a PhD program in the US. I don't think she knew very much English, if any, when she moved, and to be in a country where you don't speak the language, don't know the culture, don't even know a single person except your husband... Wow. 

I get really emotional whenever I start thinking about it. My mom is the best.
