I have this competition going on with my mom and brother--who can go the longest without masturbating. My mom said she'd put down some money for a car for the winner. So far I've gone 21 days without beating it. At first it was really hard, but as the days turned into weeks I'm surprised and pleased to say it's really made a difference in my life. I feel so free, uninhibited, and stress-free. I also find myself appreciating women more for their personality than their looks. Don't knock it 'till you try it guys! Although just looking down there...I can tell my penis has shrunk in size...not significantly, mind you...but still...just one price to pay for a car I guess hahaha.
