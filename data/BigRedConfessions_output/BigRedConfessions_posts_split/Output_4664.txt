People suck. They do stupid things that make you crazy. Ivy leagues are so over-rated and everyone here is just as ratchet as any other school. I don't get how any of these bitch-ass hoes got into such a prestigious institution. They don't even seem fucking intelligent. Stupid guys trying to get in the pants of the slutty girls and preppy exclusive guys not letting in talented men is just fucking retarded. Get a grip, Cornell. You are only number 16.
