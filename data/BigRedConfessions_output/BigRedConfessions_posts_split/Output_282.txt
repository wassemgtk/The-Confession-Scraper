I was accepted to Cornell ED for class of 2020. I started off being super excited, but now I seem to have become more and more worried/concerned. I hear people keep mentioning the depressing atmosphere, the cut-throat student population, and lack of social life at Cornell. I'm prone to be easily influenced by outside sources, but I'm hoping like hell none of these stereotypes are true.
