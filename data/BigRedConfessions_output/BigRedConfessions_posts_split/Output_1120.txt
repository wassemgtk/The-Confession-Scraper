When no one is around Sage Chapel, I love to sing "I Know that my Redeemer Lives" by Scott Soper and hear my voice echo across the arches: 
"I know that my Redeemer lives, the One who calls me home.
I long to see God face to face, to see with my own eyes.
I know that my Redeemer lives, that I shall rise again.
I know that I shall one day see the goodness of the Lord,
when God will wipe away our tears, and death will be no more.
The last day I shall rise again, shall be remade like God.
My home shall be by Godâ€™s own side, the dying, rising Lord."
It makes me feel happy to visit Sage Chapel a few times a week, whenever I am depressed because I know Jesus gave up his life for me and for others so that we may live in his name. The world no longer feels big to me and I can feel safe again and that things are in order again because God will make them that way. God Bless our campus and the world so that people may hear the word of God, live in peace, and may enter the kingdom of God. I pray that I may find my soulmate one day and we could be married in God's house, and live through and spread his word.
