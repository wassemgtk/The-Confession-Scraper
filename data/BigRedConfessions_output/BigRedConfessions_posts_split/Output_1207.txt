The vermin college students and other radicals at the University of Missouri attacked the poor president who had not one thing to do with the racist events that occurred at the university. It's funny how everyone always attacks the top person in power, even if they had not one thing to do with what happened. Unfortunately managers of any institution take the blame for any shit that happens in their organization. If we had a sane nation that would take these protesters and paddle them really well for their disrespect we would have a stronger men and women growing up in America. Without a good whippin', we have rebellious college students who are fucking pussies who don't take any blame themselves for their actions, but shoot off their mouth at others along with blaming things off at others. This sort of protesting style goes up all the way to events like Occupy Wallstreet with the street rats protesting. What they need is Jesus in their life and a good paddlin' when they were young to become constructive members of society who want to make America great again without burning and looting.
