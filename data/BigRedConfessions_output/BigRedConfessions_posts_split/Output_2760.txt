It's hard to believe that we were very close last semester and now you do everything you can to ignore me online and in person. I'm somewhere in between resenting you for burning this bridge and hoping that you're doing alright after things just fell apart. Occasionally, we see each other from a distance, but sometimes I wonder if you would notice or care if I just disappeared all together.
