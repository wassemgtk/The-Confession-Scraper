"I really like this guy. I actually thought he was really cute when he first came in as a freshman last year, but I never pursued anything because he's younger than me. Now he's a sophomore and even sexier (probably from dancing and working out), so now I've decided screw age. Problem is I don't have the courage to tell him how I feel, or let my friends know that I like him. He may also like one of my friends. Oh well I guess I'll just continue to admire him. 

If you end up reading this, which you probably won't since you haven't liked this page, I just want to tell you, you're a great dancer.
