As an international, it is 90% of my stress to receive no financial aid whatsoever, especially when my parents stay ambiguous on whether they can/want to afford it, keep telling me to consider alternatives to save money, while at the same time want me to not stress over it. Well I am, and if there is no significant amount of grant I can get to alleviate this, I might as well just withdraw and give up all my dreams.
