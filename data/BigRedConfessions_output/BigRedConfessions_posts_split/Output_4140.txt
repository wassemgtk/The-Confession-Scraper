This semester was supposed to be easy; I thought that I could take it easy and chill out after killing myself these past three years. How delusional. Even though projects should be easier than tests and even though I'm working with such amazing people I feel like my grades are getting worse and worse and that I'm so out of control of everything anymore. The work is just piling up and even though I chip away at it I can't seem to stay on top of anything and it's all just slipping away. 

I thought maybe I had defeated my depression and my hatred of self but after getting grades back and all this personal fuckery I just lost it and gave in again. The worst part is that everyone is so fucking blind. I could be joking around with you, laughing and smiling but just under the surface all my thoughts are telling me to swallow a bottle of pills or slice and dice my wrists. 

I am so tired of feeling like this and half the time I have a mind to just stop fighting anymore because I don't even know why I bother trying at this fucking point.
