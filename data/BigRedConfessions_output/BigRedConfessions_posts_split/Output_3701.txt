I said yes to sex with you because I didn't want to say no. You were my boyfriend so I was supposed to say yes. So I did. And you hurt me so much. It was so painful. I didn't want it. I didn't want it. And now whenever a guy comes close, I remember that night. Despite being so drunk I remember some moments very clearly. I'm afraid of men. I'm disgusted by men.
