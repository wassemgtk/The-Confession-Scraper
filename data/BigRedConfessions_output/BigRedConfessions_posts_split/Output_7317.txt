I feel so guilty about playing "the game" and all that that I end up not knowing how to show interest, because when I clear cut show interest they run for the hills. Then I feel like some abomination whom "should find a nice girl" but all of the peeps I'm interested in make it seem like I'm just too available. It's a stupid complaint, it's just that I want to be good friends with everyone but have that one person I know really really well and can hang out with whenever and share quirky stuff with. I just don't know how to fix this without succumbing to this Apathy Olympics that was once courting. i understand that people have been hurt, so they try to guard their emotions, but that ends up hurting other people because people court others without knowing that it's all about guarding yourself. It's like a virus, and I think people should just accept everyone as they are but still understand that someone may not be into you, you know? I really needed to get this off my chest; thanks confessions!
