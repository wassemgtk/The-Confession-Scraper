"I honestly can't wait to get back to campus. I love my family but I never realized how toxic my home environment was until I left. The constant fighting, the insecurity, the uncertainty of a roof over our heads. My mom confides all of her problems in her children. On the one hand I don't want her to suffer alone; on the other hand, I sometimes feel like I'm too young to be dealing with this shit.
As sucky as the weather may be, my Finaid package and Cornell's campus provides a sense of security that I know is entirely false; but I still relish in, regardless."
