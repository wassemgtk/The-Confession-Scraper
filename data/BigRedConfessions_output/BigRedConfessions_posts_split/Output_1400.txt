When I was younger, like elementary school aged, I was a really big trouble maker. I would talk back to the teacher, say "bad words" that I heard from other students, and I would smack kids who didn't agree with me. I was on the road to be a "bad person" according to the principal of the school and many of my teachers. My mom and dad then instituted corporal punishment in order to improve behavior. Every time I got a note or phone call from the teacher, my mom or dad would give me a good spanking over my britches with the "Board of Education." A few months later I improved in school began getting better grades, after almost failing second and third grade. By the time I entered fifth grade, I was a high honor student and I went into accelerated math by the time I entered sixth grade. By the time I finished middle school I was placed into Pre-Caculus into 9th grade. I took AP Calculus BC in 10th grade and scored a 5 on the AP BC Exam. So the corporal punishment was temporary, but actually improved my behavior and made me into a great person and very successful at Cornell. I'm not saying it should be used until high school or into adulthood, but sometimes a kid who receives some spanking or has some fear instilled into him or herself is more successful. I think not having anything to fear is a bad thing for a trouble maker kid. I think everyone of us needs fear to achieve our goals in life, whether its the fear of becoming a drug addict or poor if we don't succeed in our school work, or the fear that we will end up massive losers. Fear is everywhere. When my parents opened up their own business they feared failing. A healthy amount of fear is necessary and sometimes corporal punishment can instill a healthy amount of fear into a trouble maker kid, and propel him or herself into becoming a successful and contributing member of society. It did work for me and I think if I ever fell into depression or a low point in my life and refused to be successful or work hard, it would work again for me to receive another good spanking with the "Board of Education" as my parents called it. So therefore, I agree with the OP that corporal punishment should be used in some circumstances to improve moral and encourage someone to become successful. I believe if more students who were troublemakers received what I had in elementary school, they would be able to make it into a great college or become successful in their vocations, future businesses, or careers.
