That awkward moment when you realize the girl you're in love with is sleeping with a mutual friend. Shit. She's too beautiful, kind, funny, intelligent and spectacular for him. She is outgoing and has an infectious personality. Why is she sleeping with him? I could be so much more for her. It sucks balls when people are oblivious.
