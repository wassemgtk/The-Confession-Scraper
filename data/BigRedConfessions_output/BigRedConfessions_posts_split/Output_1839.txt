I love everyone. I love everyone I see on this campus. I love those who've given me contemptuous looks or mistreated me, if only because I know that society has allowed them to  build a concrete wall around their mind. I love those who have demonstrated an almost equally great capacity for love, if only because I know that they damage the foundation on which such walls are built. I love everyone in between, if only because I need to reconcile myself with the fact that the world won't yield to me and people will always be people. I love them because someone has to, and because I'm okay with self-righteousness. I'm unashamed of my feeling that my love is unique. 

I don't want to be seen, just heard. I don't want to be famous, just my words. 

I wonder sometimes if I will become renowned someday, then I wonder if the renowned always knew or never wondered. I'm in a strange place of pretentiousness, and I don't know if these feelings are fitting because I will be right or disconcerting because I will be wrong.

Without Cornell, I would not have awoken as the person who writes these words. And yet, with Cornell, I must push through a bunch of nothing to get to nowhere, when I already know where I want to be and what something is for me. A strange dichotomy. 

Or paradox, I should say. I only chose the former word, dichotomy, because it rhymed, sounding wordsmith-like, rhythmic, and perfect. But this second word, paradox, seems more logical. Or irony, even, would work better.

I want to be alone and writing, because I love everyone completely and people bring me only eclectic arrays of thoughts and infinite sadness- a deep sadness rooted in my love, internalized, and somehow expressed to others as a robust happiness and kindness.

I appear to be happy and kind. So people love me. And I am happy in ways allowed by my love, but mostly a masochist when I go out into the world. Not to mention, all love and kindness aside, I am flawed beyond measure and must challenge these flaws. If I can have such terrible thoughts, then what good am I? If I too have a concrete wall, secretly, then how can I profess to be the one who will puncture the walls of others? Can I?

These words have had no structure, and my love will be taken lightly, and I can't save the world because even an immense pool of love will never manifest itself as understanding in the hundreds of pairs of eyes I encounter each day.

And so I love in vain. 

I would be insane by now, if not for art, especially film. To which I must ask:

Why can't there be silence after indulging in good art? Why do people dismiss the moment after surreal, after escape, as quickly as it arrives? Why can't people revel in the post-coital ecstasy following the intercourse between your mind, body, and the screen? Why must people ask me for my thoughts on the film?  I have none. I am at peace. I am at my most free, my most tormented, my most suave, my most hectic, my most calm, my most available, my most reserved, my most loving, my most understanding, my most apathetic, my most infallible, my most complex, my most me. And, only in this resplendent second, can I feel truly brilliant in a way that seems real.

In that moment, during that second, please just leave me be.

Then I leave the theater, or I unplug the headphones, and I see the people, and I think that somehow they will know that I love them then. They will know somehow, right?

And so I love in vain, again. 

And so I love you. I do. I love you. I do. And you don't have to believe a word of what I've said, but I will say once more: I love you. I do. 

I am a black man.

This means something to you, I predict. You had thoughts, good and bad, once I lost my identity as a voiceless human being. Perhaps you even had doubts. But I love you.

And I forgive you too.
