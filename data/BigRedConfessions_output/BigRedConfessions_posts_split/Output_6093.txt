I think I'm gonna miss you no matter what. You were my best friend, you stopped talking to me without a reason. Sometimes I miss you so much it physically hurts. But since you can't even handle looking at me anymore, I'm slowly but surely moving on. I think about you less and less each day, but the pain will never truly go away.
