I read your confession and I thought it was me writing from last week...I had 4 ten-page papers due last week and a prelim, and I ended up having to turn in one of the papers 3 days late, I thought I was completely alone, I'm on academic warning, and I might fail a class. A lot of it has to do with the fact that I have terribly low self-esteem, but that's a navel-gazing essay for another time. The point is that last week life felt impossible, and I thought I was going to fail my late paper. But this week, I got that paper back with a grade of 99, a random stranger stopped me on the sidewalk and told me he couldn't resist introducing himself because I seemed like a fascinating person, and when I reached out for help against my better judgment regarding some personal issues, some people on this campus really stepped up and helped me despite that there was no benefit for them in doing so. 

I guess what I'm saying is that things may seem terrible now, but next week might be amazing. It's easy to get so bogged down by the negative things in an environment like this, and lose sight of the positive. 

You sound like an amazing person to me.
