They say "It is better to have loved and lost than to never have loved it all".  I can't imagine that those people have ever loved before.  This expression can't possibly sum up how it feels to have lost the person who made you feel strong when you were weak, who saw nothing but the best in you, who was your crying shoulder.  It fails to understand what it means to be stunned again and again by the beauty of a woman, to work your ass off fighting for a relationship because even the best ones are hard, to not have to worry about the future the present is just that good.
