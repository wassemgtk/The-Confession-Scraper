I take creepy to a whole new level. Just finished looking at your mom and sister's facebook profiles and I still look at yours even though we're not even friends on it anymore so I can't see any thing but the basics. I wonder if you ever even think of me anymore. It's not that I want to be with you; we were pretty bad together. But I wonder if I made even the slightest impact on your life. Clearly I cared in the end more than you did, but the thought of me being just another insignificant face in your life torments me. I can't stand the thought of meaning nothing. Even if your thought is, she was a cool girl, I hope you think it. I hope you remember me even though I'm supposed to hate you for how you treated me in the end.
