"To #7826:

If you are who I think you are then you should realize that we did what we had to do. It was nobody's fault, and neither of us deserve the blame. For God's sakes, we are only human. You can walk your own path, but personally I believe that I can put the entire ordeal behind me and grow into a better person. I hope that you can see far enough ahead to give yourself the same opportunity. "
