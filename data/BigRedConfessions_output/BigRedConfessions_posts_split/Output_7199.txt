"Sure you're great or seem to be but there is no way we can even work out-not at this pace, at least.
Everything about you is so good yet too good to be true at the same time.
I just don't know what it is you want from me. Why the interest?
All of the promises you've made are much too optimistic.
No man has ever been as good as you, therefore I'm skeptical. 
I have trust issues...Is your smile really genuine? Are your intentions good?  Your heart really open? Most of your actions prove you have all of these characteristics..but I just can't seem to trust anyone. 
I've played these games before and am not sure if I can withstand one more heartache. 
Soon you'll be gone, just a memory..

Despite all this I'll continue talking to you and this will probably amount to nothing great. 
I just need answers, a sign.... :/
