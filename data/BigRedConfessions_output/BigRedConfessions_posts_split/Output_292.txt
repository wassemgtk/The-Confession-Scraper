The neighbors directly below my apartment are unimaginably awful, and I don't know what else to do about it. They're constantly playing (from about 9 am-4 am) loud, thumping music so that my roommate and I can't study or sleep. I bought earplugs, which I wear all the time now, but even the floor separating us and earplugs combined don't block out the sound or the vibrations. They have people over several times a week, and are frequently outside shouting at each other at 1, 2, or even 4 am. Our neighbors have contacted our landlord and called the cops on them several times, but nothing has changed. They have had their garbage piling up outside our front door for 2 months now. It smells awful, and animals have been tearing into the bags, leaving used tampons, tissues, and half-eaten chicken wings scattered in the driveway. For a while they were even piling garbage in the stairwell to our basement, blocking access to the washing machine/dryer. And those are only a couple of the problems. We've confronted them many times, and have complained to our landlord, and nothing seems to be helping. It just sucks because we specifically moved to a quiet neighborhood downtown so that we could study and sleep more, but then our landlord sold the house to someone else who made very little effort to rent to people who would be appropriate for the neighborhood. How can some people so rude and inconsiderate?
