So I've been waiting for a whole week to pass before saying this.  I'm a freshman and I don't really have any friends.  Everyone seems so close already, and I meet new people, but nobody that I'm actually friends with.  I get that it's still the beginning of the semester, and that some clubs haven't even started yet, but is it going to get better?  I'm not an unfriendly person, I introduce myself to people next to me in lectures but after that hour is over, I don't see them again.  It's just frustrating because I'm putting in an effort but it isn't helping.  For instance, after one class, I walked back to North campus with some people I had just met, but the entire time, they only talked to each other.  I tried starting a conversation but it always ended up being the two of them.  I love Cornell already but things would be so much better if I had some real friends...
