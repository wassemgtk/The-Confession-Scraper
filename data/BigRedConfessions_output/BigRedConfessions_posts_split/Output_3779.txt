Why are so many people so stupid? I know natural selection requires a wide spectrum of genetic availability, but honestly I often wonder how we're all the same species. The same goes for attractiveness. It'd be nice if evolution worked thru a less convoluted channel that didn't result in so many ugly and dumb people.
