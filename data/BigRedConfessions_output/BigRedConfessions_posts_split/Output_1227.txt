I hooked up with a Cornell professor who gave me herpes. I know it is him because he was the only person I hooked up with in a long time, and I instantly got signs of the outbreak 2 days later. This came up as a big shock to me, because I am always very careful, and never expected something like this. I don't know if he knew he was having an outbreak or not, but I do remember he mentioned he wasn't feeling too well a few days before we hooked up, and then said he was fine. He also gave me a lot of alcohol and wanted to have sex with me but when I strongly refused, he didn't push forward although he showed signs that he was clearly pissed. I told him not to take it personally because I don't have sex with people before I am in a relationship with them. He said that I will never find a gay boyfriend if I don't have sex with guys before I am in a relationship with them because "that is just how gay guys are."

When I told him he gave me herpes, he said herpes is super common and that I should be bothered by my weak immune system instead, because I wouldn't have gotten an outbreak had my immune system been strong. He did keep in touch for a few days and then stopped communication. 

I don't blame him, because I can't be sure he knew, but I still believe he should have been more apologetic and also should have agreed to get tested when I told him to do so in order to prevent transmitting the infection to other people (he said he doesn't know if it's him who gave me herpes and don't think it's an issue). I felt very vulnerable and ashamed of myself for months following this. I am better now, and never go unprotected even for 30 seconds of oral sex, because you never know. Protect yourself guys - oral sex has a lot of risks too.
