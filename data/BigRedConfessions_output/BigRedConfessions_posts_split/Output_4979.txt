Have you ever realized after talking to someone for hours and hours that the whole time they've talked about themselves without ever a thought for you?

Sometimes I get so tired of constantly assuring people that things will be okay for them. 
Just ask me how I'm doing once in a while because you never know if I'll just break down and tell you what's really on my mind. 

Usually I don't feel like talking but once in a while just ask me how I'm doing. Even that small gesture is really appreciated.
