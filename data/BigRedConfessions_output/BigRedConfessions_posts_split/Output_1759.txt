I feel sorry for my friend because she gets rejections from almost all the guys she likes. Life is not fair - she's beautiful, ambitious, and kind. I recently figured out that her crush likes me instead. I think it's cute but I am not going to hurt her feelings and date this guy. I really think he should give her a chance and go on a date with her BEFORE making a decision.
