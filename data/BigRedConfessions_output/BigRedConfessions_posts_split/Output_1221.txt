The driver for Route 70 today made my day. He was so enthusiastic. He said hello to every single person who boarded, and was super sweet to the lady with the baby. I really cannot believe the attitude that he has, because I know I would not be able to do that for the whole day. I wish I had that attitude in life. How you act really influences others, because even though I barely exchanged words with him, he made me really happy.
