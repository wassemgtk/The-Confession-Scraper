Extended time on tests is the biggest bullshit there is. What happens after you graduate? If you think you're boss is going to give you "extended time" on deadlines, presentations, projects, etc. then you are clearly delusional. You're not preparing yourself properly for the real world. Our society should be merit based. We need people who can get the job done. I don't give a shit about your background.
