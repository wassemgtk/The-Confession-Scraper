You won't read this because you're not on facebook, but you are the funnest, cutest, most interesting, shyest in the sweetest way possible, geekiest in the most attractive way possible, most gorgeous girl I have ever met. I tried to ask you out last week and I'm not positive if I actually did... There won't be any ambiguity next time I talk to you. I will try as hard as I can to get you. You are worth any amount of effort, you are worth anyone's very best, you are worth the Universe.
