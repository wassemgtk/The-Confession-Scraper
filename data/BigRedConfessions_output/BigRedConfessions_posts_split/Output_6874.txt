"It's really isolating being a virgin in college, especially since the few times I have tried to start a relationship the girl wasn't really interested in me that way. I am not ethically against casual sex either but that just doesn't seem like something that will ever happen to me. It seems like there is so much emphasis on sex and relationships, and I have had neither. I don't pity myself or anything, in fact it's more like I see everyone else as lustful hedonist animals. I feel like I am living in the Brave New World by Aldous Huxley. It's not that I look down on sexually active people, I just feel so alienated from them. I have very little social skills and few friends, and that doesn't seem like it will change any time soon. That doesn't bother me though.

If you think I am a pathetic loser or a frustrated pervert you can go fuck yourself because you are probably a hypocrite.

And I swear to god if some retard posts a fucking meme in the comments I will track them down and smother them with a pillow."
