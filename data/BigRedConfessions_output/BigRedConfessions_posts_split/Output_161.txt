As I am getting ready to graduate, I keep reflecting on my time here. I liked it. It had ups and downs but overall, I am better for the experience. If I were to give one piece of advice, it would be to take action to minimize regrets. I've had a crush on a girl in ep since sophomore year. I didn't do anything and now we're going to graduate and that's probably my biggest regret. Don't let fear creep into your mind. Be confident in yourself or at least work toward it because its progress. Fear weakens and paralyzes you. Don't let it. It's only now that I'm realizing that life is too short for regrets. I'm not saying you have to be a positive, upbeat person every day because that's not possible. Just keep your mind on the positives as much as you can and take risks because you're young and regrets suck.
