"I don't want to be cliche and just say what everyone else says but I'm a sheltered Indian virgin girl. I'm not stick thin like pretty much everyone else here and I'm socially awkward and I want to have fun but I don't know how to put myself out there. All guys are like ""approach us too, don't put it on us to ask you out"" but I feel so insignificant all the time and all of my friends are girls so I can't be like ""tell me how a guy's mind works"" I want to have guy friends, I want to lose my virginity, I want to meet people that I can call my best friends for the rest of the life but instead I feel like I'm always the one awkwardly asking people to lunch or saying hi and that everyone's already formed their friend groups while I'm on the outside. All of my friends from home are just like ""oh I did this thing and this thing and I've met all these people and I have 4 best friends already that I'm so comfortable with"" and I'm honest-to-god happy for them because I love them but I just wish that I could have that too.

What do I do?"
