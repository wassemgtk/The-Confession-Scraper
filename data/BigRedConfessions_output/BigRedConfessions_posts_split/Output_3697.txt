Hey dude who walked past me in the library and was forced to smell my gas attack. I'm sorry brah. I was in a pretty secluded area and didn't think anyone would walk past me. Anyways, a man's gotta fart from time to time right? Hahaha. Thank God you weren't a hot girl. #noshame LOL

At least I found a sure fire way to get rid of people nearby me when I want a study space. HAHAHA. That couch is mine!
