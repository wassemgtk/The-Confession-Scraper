To #7052, the confused TA:

I have seen this happen too (I'm not American). I TA a big class, and I've felt this a lot too. The prof - who has a reputation for being a friendly, down-to-earth guy - barely ever acknowledges me, but is friendly with the other TAs. He knows only my last name, and has mispronounced it at least half the times we have spoken. He never says anything other than what is required, and just nods when I make conversation. With the other TAs he'll discuss everything from their careers to their dinners.

I would speculate that it could be something to do with me not fitting in with a majority-white course staff, but that is not true. Both my off campus jobs involved working in offices full of white people, and I had no such problems in either of the places. People treated me like they did the other interns, I never felt left out in any way. It was like people never saw race.

TAing is a thankless job if you look for validation from profs or your peers. My satisfaction comes from other aspects of this process.  I don't really care about the professor recognizing me, but I think you do and you should know that you aren't alone. 

I think a lot of weird social stratification I see is part of the Cornell culture somehow. I have always felt at ease and involved interacting with Americans off campus, whether it's a job or karaoke night. I thought this country was very unfriendly until I spent a couple summers (+semester) elsewhere.
