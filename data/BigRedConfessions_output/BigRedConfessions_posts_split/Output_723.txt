There's no hope for me in this world.  If the greater world around me knew what my life has been, is like, and will be, I would expect to see nothing less than tears and horror on faces besides my own.  Why do people say that "everything heals with time"?  Shouldn't the saying go, "everything heals with time if you're lucky"?  Or "everything heals with time*  *only for a select few"?  Because the things you've seen when you were young, when you were growing, and even now--these things stay with you forever, whether it be in the form of flashbacks, emotions, or an altered brain.  It's never enough for people to just accept that not everything heals with time for everyone; why are people so naively optimistic, especially the ones who haven't been through much or have been lucky in healing?  News flash:  The world doesn't work in everyone's favor.  I'm sick of dealing with everything.  I despise society and the cruel, strict way it runs.  I hate the concept of family.  I'm sick of hearing everyone make their life struggles a) exaggerated and b) a competition, especially when they have experienced nearly nothing (sorry. but not actually).  I'm tired of being unable to fall asleep until 4 AM because some memories or thoughts have kept me past the point of sleeping.  I'm so exhausted wondering what the cops will think of my body when they find me dead and empty-eyed someday.  If they carry my body, will they make a side comment, "certainly not skinny"?  I'm so sick of being labeled the outcast, when really, this is what everything has made me and it's so normal.  I'm just a tired soul.
