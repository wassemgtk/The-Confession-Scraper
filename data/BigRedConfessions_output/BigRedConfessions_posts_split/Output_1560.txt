I wish another "Eisenhower" were president again, preferably someone who was a war hero, as I am an older alum who started following this page and have to say most of these posts are not even close to reminding me of what Cornell used to be like. My granddaughter now attends Cornell and she was raised in a conservative family. She was shocked by the campus environment and encouraged me to follow this page in order to see how Cornell has changed from the days I attended. I always described to her a happy cheerful, postwar version of Cornell. I went to Cornell in the 1950's when life was cheerful under Eisenhower's administration and we built up the greatest nation on Earth, and I met my beautiful wife of 60 years there. I even remember my ROTC days where all men had to participate in the army training exercises there. The program was amazing and I met many of my lifelong friends there. Through the program, I received an inexpensive education and dutifully served my country and received many honors to ensure that my grandchildren can live in a better world. People were very happy and not weak and depressed like they are today due to the massive use of hallucinogens, alcohol, and anti-depressants. May God bless all of you to stay away from these harmful substances and so that you may do well in your studies. We can only depend upon young men and women like yourselves to propel this nation to be great again like it was back then.
