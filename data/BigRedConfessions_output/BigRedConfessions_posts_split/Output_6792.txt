I'm a minority and guess what? My financial aid is substantially shittier than that of my minority friends. They go shopping every weekend and get to pocket their money while I can barely afford to wash my own clothes. But because I'm middle class Cornell assumes I'm friggin rolling in dough pimping hard or something. No. The financial aid struggle goes both ways. Cornell doesn't give a rats ass about the middle class and that's that.
