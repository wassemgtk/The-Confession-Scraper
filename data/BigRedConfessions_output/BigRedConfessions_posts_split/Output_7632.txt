"I ruined everything with the best girl in the world.  Twice.  The first time felt like it was the natural progression of things.  We were fighting a ton and everything felt like it was collapsing.  So I broke up with her.  Throughout the fall we would still go through periods of being incredibly close to not speaking.  When the semester came to an end, we thought we would say our goodbyes and end things amicably.

But then over winter break we spent an entire day together and I was reminded of everything positive in our relationship and how much I loved her despite the flaws and fights, so I asked if we could try to repair things.  She said yes, and I was more ecstatic than I'd ever been in my life.  But then I came back to school while she graduated early, and I neglected to talk to her for nearly two weeks for a really dumb reason.  When she called me upset about it (among other things), I lost my temper and broke up with her for a second time, fracturing the stability she had built up after our first break up and her original readiness to move on.

Now, she's cut off all contact with me over every form of communication imaginable.  And I'm an emotional wreck.  I hide it well, because I'm just the kind of person who can effectively disguise how they actually feel, but on the inside (and in private) I break down over her.  I didn't realize how cripplingly lonely I would feel if I was completely severed from her.  I didn't realize that over the past year she had become my other half and my outlet for any thoughts or feelings I might have.  I didn't realize how painful this would all be.  But most importantly of all: I didn't realize how truly special she was.

I break into uncontrollable tears every time I glance at just the envelope containing the diary entry she gave me about a day in our relationship that feels like a lifetime ago.  I've called her well over a dozen times in the past week knowing she blocked my number just to hear her voice greet me and tell me to leave a message after the tone.  What few pictures we have together are a constant reminder to me of how truly happy I used to be and how I let it all go on an emotionally fueled whim.  And seeing my friends interact with their girlfriends crushes my heart and makes me long for days long past.

I guess I deserve this torture for the pain I put her through.  I guess you really never know what you got till it's gone.  And I know that I'm terrible person for all the emotional suffering she went through over me in the past several months.  But on the off chance that she still follows this page and reads this confession, I just want her to know this: I regret everything.  I regret the way I treated you after we broke up the first time, I regret breaking your heart, I regret causing you this much pain again, and I regret that I took you and our relationship for granted.  I'm not asking for a second chance; I know I don't deserve one.  I just want to hear your actual voice one last time and talk about nothing like we used to for just 5 minutes.  I just want to relive the happiest days of my life, even if it's just for an instant.
