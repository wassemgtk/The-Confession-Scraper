You were a part of me, 
Now long forgotten.
The things we did
reduced to hollow images and 
strange feelings.
And even if I try to remember, 
My body no longer knows your touch.
Affection has been abandoned
like an orange peel, 
Sticky and bitter.
Now all that remains is the pain.
A vague memory of tears and
loud noises, naked on the floor.
You talk of friendship and civility, 
But all I want is for you to be a stranger again.
One who in passing I will not recognize.
