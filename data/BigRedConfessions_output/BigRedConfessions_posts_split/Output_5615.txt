One of my professors, I've noticed, has checked out my chest on multiple occasions, and my wardrobe is none too revealing since I come from a pretty conservative, mormon family. So when I needed a regrade, I borrowed an outfit that showed off my tits. He didn't give me a definite answer bur strong implications in my favor... Here's to hoping!
