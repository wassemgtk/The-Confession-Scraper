People at Cornell are too willing to fuck with other people and their feelings. You would think a group of kids as smart as this would not burn bridges so easily. Guys that call girls disgusting, degrading names, girls that stab each other and ruin each other's reputations behind each others' backs... you should be ashamed of yourself. But besides that, these are going to be some powerful people in the world and you never know when your paths should cross again. For example, I'm going into HR and I can damn well tell you that if some people's resumes came through... they would meet the office shredder!
