When you decided to stop talking to me, you lost a great friend who has clout that is both political and otherwise. Maybe we didn't agree on everything, but that's because we are people and people are entitled to have different beliefs. You didn't let me say what I wanted to say because you like to suppress other people's thoughts. Anyways I am happy to not have to see or talk to you again, because if I ever apply for a job with the federal government I do not want to have to say that I have associated myself with people who break the law and are subversive to the United States of America. May you be blessed with the best of intentions and become a successful and contributing member to this society rather than someone who complains and just wants to leech on it.
