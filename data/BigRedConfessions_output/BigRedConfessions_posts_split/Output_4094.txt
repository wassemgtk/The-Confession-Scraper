Speaking as a person suffering from depression, eating disorders, etc, ALL I want is someone who cares about me to ask me if I'm okay.  And not just ask me but REALLY mean it...I just need someone to talk to, someone who is willing to listen.  If someone you know seems down, just take a few minutes to talk to them.  You can make all the difference, just by being there.
