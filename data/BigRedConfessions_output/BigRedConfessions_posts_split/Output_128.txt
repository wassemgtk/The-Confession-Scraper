"I can't ever hold a feeling for someone.  I think I convince myself for a long time that I like someone, and then it goes away, and then I keep trying to make it happen and keep telling myself that I like them, and keep focusing on their good qualities to force myself to keep liking them.  But in the end, it just goes.  It's actually been worrying me for a long time, but I hate saying it because it sounds so stupid and trivial compared to other problems even I might face.  What if I never like anyone long enough to get married?  What if everything is just a bust for my feelings?  You can't just make yourself feel something right?  

Does anyone else know what I'm talking about, and if it's not some stupid issue? I'm scared I'll never like someone long enough to stay."
