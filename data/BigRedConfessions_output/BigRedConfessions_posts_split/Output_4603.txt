I began applying for jobs one year ago during the fall of my senior year and since then have landed absolutely nothing. I graduated in May with a very marketable major, my grades are decent, I've had several internships throughout college, and all of my friends from my major are either employed or in graduate school right now...but none of that seems to matter when it comes to me getting employed. I came to Cornell for a prosperous career, and I'm really starting to think that it was a waste.
