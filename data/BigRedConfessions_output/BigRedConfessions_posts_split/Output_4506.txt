"Everybody says we're the perfect couple. They see us sleeping together every night, they sense the romantic attraction between us, they never hear about fights or disagreements or anything. But that's just it. They never hear about it.

They don't know about how fucked up our sex life is, no matter how much we try to make it work, because I'm asexual. They don't know how our miscommunications spiral into both of us feeling rejected by the other. They don't know about the nights I've spent crying over you. They don't know about the buildup of subtle slights, like always letting doors slam in my face despite me always holding them for you or running ahead of me when I'm too tired to match your speed, how it festers in my heart and when I try talking to you about them, you brush it off as me being a pampered princess.

They don't know about the times I've broken up with you and how you cried. They don't know about how I demanded roses out of you because I was desperate for any sign of lingering romance. They don't know about how I used to slap you out of frustration, and I don't think you knew that I meant it to hurt just a bit.

And they'll never see any of it, because they don't know our lives nearly as well as 'close friends' should, because you're the only one I ever open up to, and I'm the only one you trust with certain secrets. They don't know about my suicidal thoughts, or my panic disorder. They don't know about your ex who lied to you about being on the Pill and ended up getting an abortion. They don't know about the time I was molested. They don't know about your struggles with weight.

This isn't to say that I don't love you. I do, because you somehow made me trust you more in a month than I've ever trusted anybody before. I love your creativity and passion and drive for what you love, and I love your complete support of my art, and I love the way you kiss my back when we're spooning. You brought stability to a life that had never known it. But when you say things like, ""You're not the girl I started dating,"" or ""Your mental problems are the venom in our relationship,"" how can I not question us? And how can I bring back the happiness we once shared when you're so defeatist?"
