"Does anyone else actually support not having free bus passes for first-year students? I mean, I wouldn't be surprised if the increase in ridership that TCAT finds so troubling is predominantly from freshmen taking the bus to Uris because they're too lazy to walk the 10 minutes it takes to get to class. I think the 6pm and weekends policy is completely fine for encouraging freshmen to get to know the campus and surrounding area - and if you really need the bus pass, you should be willing to pay for the convenience (or make financial aid cover it if you can prove that). If you break your ankle, or have a class at the vet school one semester, or can only go to the mall at this one particular time during the day and desperately need food, or absolutely despise walking, just pay for single rides or get yourself the bus pass. I don't see the problem.

It would also be nice for the bus to not be too full (mainly because of freshmen taking advantage of it to get to the arts quad) to even stop anywhere after the first RPCC/Appel stops, so that I could actually make use of the bus privileges I specifically paid for to streamline the process of getting to work, near the vet school. Which, unlike Uris, is a bus-worthy walk away.

You have legs, and this is Cornell; you knew you'd have to use them, so suck it up and do so.
