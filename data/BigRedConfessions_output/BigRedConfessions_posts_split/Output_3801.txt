I still don't believe in ghosts but a while back I saw one. I woke up in the middle of the night and it was hovering over me. I had been drinking, so I figured I was just seeing things. After wiping the sleep from my eyes, it was still there and seemed to be legit. So naturally I then decided to start beating off thinking that this ghost must be into me. Maybe it would be like one of these 80s movies where people get freaky with a ghost. It must have been real because it was so disgusted with me that it left. Needless to say, I'm not terribly successful with women. More worrisome is the thought that it might've been my grandma. .
