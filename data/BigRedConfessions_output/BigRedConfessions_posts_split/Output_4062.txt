I don't know if anyone else has had this experience at Pixel, but tonight on Halloween at 12:52PM, before they were closed, a bouncer aggressively pushed my friend and I who were at the front of the line, of legal age for drinking, trying to get in. We were not doing anything, just standing there with our ID's. He screamed: "NO ONE IS GETTING IN!" and pushed both us of. I almost fell over. We tried calling the police to report him, but the police didn't believe us. We tried talking to the manager at Pixel that night, and he said that there is no way his employee would do such a thing. My friend cried because she was so upset. I am just angry that something like this could happen in 2014. The fact that no one believed us pisses me beyond belief. I will do something about this, and I hope Cornell has a community does something about it too.
