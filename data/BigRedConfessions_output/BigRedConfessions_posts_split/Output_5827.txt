I want to find a girl who adores me as much as I adore her. I want a relationship where neither of us have to even try to enjoy each other's company. If she's kind and down to earth, she'd be gorgeous in my eyes. We'd understand each other's humor and it would be so easy for us laugh. And she would not just be an object of sexual desire. I'd respect her and support her the same way she'd do to me. But I'd still sexually desire her ;) And the relationship wont be confining; we wont be bound to each other indefinitely. If this girl exists, and she definitely does, i want to ask her to dinner and see where things go. If we like each other a lot, we could get drunk together. But this is just my romanticized fantasy.
