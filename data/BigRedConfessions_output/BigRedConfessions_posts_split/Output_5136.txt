Hear me out:

Sometimes I feel like a goddess with no worshippers. You know, how people tell a girl she should always think highly of herself...
I feel alone, sunken in the abyss that is my mind...yet I feel like when I walk, I walk on clouds..
but
Lonely, my friends all busy..
Forgotten, because I'm 95% of the time the one who has to send the first text, or make the call...
I don't get it. I'm friendly, I'm not bad looking, in decent shape...
What is it?

There is so much in my mind that I'd love to illustrate to those that may care about interacting with me...

Too optimistic? Too religious? Too set in my ways?
I thought coming to college was not about losing yourself...but upholding that identity that makes you so you....
And if that's what I've tried to do
Then why is it that I feel so unsatisfied?
