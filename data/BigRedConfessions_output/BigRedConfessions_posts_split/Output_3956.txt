I have been verbally harassed four times this semester alone (and some more times in previous semesters) while walking alone, each time by a slightly older college male driving by in a car. (To avoid accusations of these people being sexist, I am male) I honestly thought that this kind of douchebaggery would end with graduation from high school, but that clearly is not the case. I guess I was just too naive to think that everyone can be mature, right?
