I get that you realized that you were happier with another guy, but the fact that you found him while still with me hurts. The fact that you kept me hanging for over a month, while all i wanted was some honesty hurts.  The fact that you just decided to let me know you were in a new relationship and I was just an ex through a f*cking text message hurts.  You put me through all this and never even apologized.  When did you become so uncaring?
