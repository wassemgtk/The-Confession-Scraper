I used to think blue balls were a myth or grossly exaggerated because I'd never had them. Suddenly this year I started having them a lot. Maybe it's due to age. A few times this year I was at parties where I had long makeout sessions with girls. The same thing happened every time -- an hour later as I was walking home I got intense cramps in my lower abdomen. It took me a while to notice the pattern and realize what it actually was. Apparently it's very unhealthy if left "untreated". Friends don't let friends go to bed after hours of horniness. Don't do it guys. Either seal the deal or take care of it yourself. The pain is real.
