I have been battling eating disorders since I was 11 years old, and now that I'm 22, I still have a more controlled form of disordered eating. Over the course of these 11 years, I've been every weight from 75 lbs to 160 lbs, finally managing to maintain 125-130 lbs. I strive to maintain a healthy lifestyle with a raw food diet and light exercise, but usually around twice a month, I slip up and go on 2000 calorie binges. I'm terrified of gaining back the weight that I lost, but the urge to binge on sugary treats is just too strong sometimes.
