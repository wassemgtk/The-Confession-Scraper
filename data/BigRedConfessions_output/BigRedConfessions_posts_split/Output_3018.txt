I long to find another introvert who has no problem rubbing my hands as we lay next to each other in silence. I want someone I can read novels with, share our favorite quotes, drink wine, bob our heads to our favorite tunes. I want to dive right into someone else's world with them. I want our worlds to mesh and collide in a gentle, forgiving way. 

The problem is I know how to love all too well.
