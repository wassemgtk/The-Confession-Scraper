(I'm the person who sent in the alcohol confession) Hi yes, this has nothing to do with illegality, you are not understanding. I am uncomfortable because of a PREVIOUS incident with alcohol, and the law reminds me of that. This is why I don't even like telling people about my problem, I just stop talking. I'm not saying it's immoral to drink if you're underage, jesus christ, I said the problem is my comfort level.
