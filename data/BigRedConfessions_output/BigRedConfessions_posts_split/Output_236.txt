"I was almost one year and a half clean from self injury. But I got so close today. So close. For a long time I thought those feelings were behind me, that I have already out grown the past. But today I once more felt that feeling of suffocating in depressive thoughts, as if my body and my mind simultaneously want to scream out loud and crawl into a ball. But I can't scream. And I got so close to picking up the old habit again. And I felt ashamed.

For those of you who may have seen this on your friend, please don't freak out. Please just be nice to them and when you are close enough ask if they feel comfortable talking to you about it. We are just normal people, and happy people on most days. Cornell is a beautiful place and I absolutely love my days here, which is why I've always thought that I've learned to love myself enough now. But there might be just that one night, when you stand in an empty corridor staring at the mirror and feel that pain building up in your chest and you want to cry and scream and throw stuff. But you can't. "
