I feel sexually repressed.

I say this because it seems as though everyone around me is having sexual experiences, and I can't focus on my work or social life without the burden of having to find some sexual partner (a girl) to have some fun with. I do not objectify women, but view sexuality and companionship as something that allows me to focus to my greatest potential. There is nothing quite like the warm embrace of a caring woman at my side.

I have also never had sex in my life. It is frustrating to have sporadic make outs occur once every two months at best, and yet never have sex. It is a thought that consumes me; a barrier that I feel needs to be broken down sooner rather than later. I need to have sex, soon. Otherwise, I fear I may break down, and that's not healthy.

In short, I know it's not right for me to have this thirst for sexuality, yet I cannot find myself able to focus unless I am engaged in sexuality. All I ask for is to have sex, one time, and then I'll be much better. For now, I'll continue to have this never ending desire to have it, and it will consume me to the core.
