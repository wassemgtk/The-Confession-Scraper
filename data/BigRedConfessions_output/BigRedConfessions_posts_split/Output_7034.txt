I honestly hate you. You are an ugly prick with a huge nose who's too arrogant for his own good. I can't believe I let you treat me so badly. I should have believed you when you said I was way out of your league; I am way out of your league. Now whenever I walk into you, you give me that stupid smirk. Thank God I didn't give you what you wanted. I hate seeing you. I don't even wish bad for you; I just hate seeing you. Please stay on your side of campus you undeserving asshole. I literally want to throw up now. If I could unmeet you, I would.
