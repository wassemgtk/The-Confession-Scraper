Also as a follow up to the Overheard confession, to the people making fun of the two Go Fund Me pages: Ya'll are basically making fun of people for not being able to afford Cornell. 

What a privilege it is to laugh it off, and not be the person hurrying in to make the October 9 deadline so that they can keep their place in the only hope that they have for their family to get out of the shitty circumstances that they were born into. I guess for you if you had to leave Cornell, you'd have Plan's A - Z of other options for your future. We're fucked. 

I can imagine that it's tough for these students to create the page and ask others for help (like many of us, we've only relied on ourselves for help all these years, anyways). You think the process couldn't be made any more difficult than it is (studying for prelims, while trying not to get kicked out, wondering where your parents are going to pull that money from even though they themselves can barely get by at home), but no. Your own peers make fun of you. 

Grow up.
