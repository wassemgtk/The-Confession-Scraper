Okay. So in my personal situation, this isn't a story, this is real life, and I'm the one who has to deal with the aftermath. But it's easier to put it this way. I HATE amnesia story arcs. They piss me the fuck off. SO. FUCKING. MUCH. Why do people think that's cool? Take a perfectly good character with a perfectly good story and then for some goddamn reason decide to give them amnesia?! It renders EVERYTHING meaningless, all of their development, everything that happened that shaped who they are... It's traumatizing for the people who have to deal with it. I absolutely fucking hate it. It's sadistic, it's rude, it's annoying, just... FUCK!!!!!!!!! How the hell am I gonna pick up these pieces? Fucking bullshit....
