I've never felt more alone than during my time here at Cornell, I'm very glad that I'm graduating and starting a new chapter in my life. I don't mean to sound bitter; I don't despise my Cornell experience. In many ways it's taught me valuable lessons about friendship, fitting in, self-image and the importance of being yourself. I regret not spending enough time with the people I truly like. Instead, I followed crowds, hanging out with people that are simply acquaintances at best. It's an embarrassing revelation that I realize with humility. Everybody always makes it seem like you find your best friends in college - I guess I just fell through the cracks.
