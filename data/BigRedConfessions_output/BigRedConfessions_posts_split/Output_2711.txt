I save up all the money I don't send to help out my mother and brother for grad school and honestly, it just seems worthless. I wanted to spend $200 for a flight to visit my high school best friend at school in South Carolina, and I didn't to keep saving up. I just wanted 3 days of warm weather and fun. Instead, I'm home, where the temperature is the same as Ithaca's.
