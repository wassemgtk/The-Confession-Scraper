So I'm not trying to hate or anything, just curious. When people lose their jacket at a frat part / club, is it usually stolen or did someone just take it by mistake? And when you post on facebook about losing the jacket, do you ever retrieve it? Or is it long gone? Like how does this whole system work. Someone tell me.
