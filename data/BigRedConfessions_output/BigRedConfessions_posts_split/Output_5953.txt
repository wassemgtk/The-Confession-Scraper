I cut out so much to try to make this environment work: a bunch of clubs, routinely meeting up with friends, volunteering, piano, reading/writing for leisure, all but the occasional show on hulu/netflix each week... and getting rid of all those things has left me completely demotivated. I got so much more done when I was "wasting time" because at least there was a point to it all. I don't want to be all work (or all nothing, at this point) but I'm too afraid to add back any real, guilt-free leisure.
