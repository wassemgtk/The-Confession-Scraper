When I was in first grade, I got a winter Barbie doll as a Christmas gift. I loved this doll! But I lost one of her shoes and was devastated. One day I was playing in front of the mirror and I saw a blue shoe in the reflection and I thought it was the missing shoe. I was jubilant and so grateful for a second (this might have been one of the happiest moments of my life tbh because it was such a pure and innocent happiness), until I realized it was just the original shoe I hasn't lost. If there was anyway we could start over, I would feel the same way I felt when I thought I found that lost shoe. As a child, I blamed myself for losing that shoe. I don't blame myself for us breaking up because it was a two way effort, but I know there were things I could have done differently and I know there were things you could have done differently. I know it's insane  since we ended on such an acerbic note and I can't think of a time when our relationship wasn't tumultuous so getting back together would only be a quick fix for some discomfort I'm experiencing now and only hurt me more later. Perhaps this is just the me who is still healing and dealing with the aftermath of our breakup speaking because it could very well be we are better off without each other, but there were some great times between us and those are the times I long for. I don't miss the last couple of months, but I miss all that was before and I don't understand: where did we go wrong? One day I did get over the fact that I lost that shoe (probably right after the holiday season) so one day I will get over the fact that we lost everything that was good between us (hopefully it's that quick :p).
