I've been suffering from depression since my junior year of high school. Somehow I managed to get into my dream school and I'm almost done with my first semester. Depression is still affecting my life. My grades are very poor. I feel guilty. I get a full ride to this institution. I'm ashamed by the fact that someone else has been generous enough to make an Ivy League education possible for me while I've been failing to perform to the best of my ability. I just hope this ends here and I'm able to get my act together before the next semester starts.
