To the person who I got into a fight with recently, I would like to tell you that I can forgive everything as long as you apologize. I have been waiting for it for days. And it's excruciating for me to ignore you.

I want you to know that I did not mean what I said. But I couldn't let you use my generosity to hurt me anymore. That was why I said those harsh words.

Please just say sorry. Because I miss you so much that I don't need any further explanation.
