I'm living with someone who is indifferent to almost everything I say. A story that makes another friend keel over from laughter has no effect on her. I'm having regrets about letting her live next door to me because she is no fun. She doesn't seem to give a shit about me and what's worse is that I eat with her very often because it's convenient. She doesn't talk much to me, which shows how little interest she has in me because she can be very sociable around people she likes. Sometimes when I eat with her, she watches Youtube videos. I'm tempted to leave my seat and strike up a conversation with a stranger sitting nearby. Does living together usually cause friends to grow apart?
