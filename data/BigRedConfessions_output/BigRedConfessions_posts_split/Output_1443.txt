Everyone tells me that human relationships are the only thing that make life worth living, but even then, I'm too weak to enter a relationship. All good things come to an end, and I don't want to start a relationship knowing one day it'll end. I don't want to risk all the good things that I have from these friendships, so I'm just going to sit back and let these opportunities slip away.
