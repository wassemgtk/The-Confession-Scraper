"Schoolwork doesn't stress me out. It just doesn't. Which is ironic, since my actual experiences related to my major are extremely stressful. It makes me question whether I can handle the stress AFTER school, but you know what? I made a major move in a club that I'm part of, and it was the most exhilarating feeling in the world to hear one of the leaders tell me that what I did was really helpful. I don't want much praise, but when I get it for things I deserve, it's the best feeling in the world. And that's how I know that I love my major. So much so that it's all I really think about, or care about. Regardless of all the stress in actually applying my skills and knowledge, it's all worth it. Really, the 5 minutes of fame destroy the month of gridlock, miscommunication, lack of communication, lack of visibility, conflict, and indeterminateness.

Cornell students! This is for you! Find your passion! Seek what motivates you! Chase after it, regardless of how difficult the path will be!
