I hate it when people say - don't joke about that, don't say that, don't talk about that, etc. for purely inane superstitious reasons. Just how far does your irrationality extend. Will you start burning witches next? I can talk about dead babies and getting Parkinson's or whatever I want. Why not the opposite? Why not believe if you DON'T talk about them, they will happen? I choose to subscribe to that nonsense. So if you don't talk about getting sick and dying of cancer, I take that as meaning you want me to die of cancer! How dare you! And of course, wanting it to happen increases the chances of it happening as has been shown countless studies showing the effectiveness of prayer.
