"I'm a guy and I have these screwed up emotional cycles. There are times where I feel I'm on top of the world and that I'm Alexander the Great reincarnated, and at other times I feel like a eunuch in the Ottoman harem. During those times I'm at my most depressed, I usually don't cry. I usually try to ignore the many traumatic problems assailing me on all sides. 
         But in the end I end up fixating on them--whether it's comparing myself to my very successful peers who have surpassed me by miles in all aspects of life, or thinking about how two decades of emotional abuse that my mother bore throughout her arranged marriage resulted in her basically being reduced from a sweet and loving woman into a violent, depressed border-line alcoholic, or how my dad fathered a few bastards and has his mistress living around the block from my little brothers and how he loves my cousins more than us, or the one time I was sexually abused by an older cousin when I was 5, or how my family is now near bankruptcy and I'm partly to blame, or how I fucked up academically beyond repair. 
     It literally feels like a heavy weight has been placed on my chest and it's slowly extinguishing what little will power I had. It's at those moments I find a quiet spot to myself, close my eyes, and let the tears flow. I've considered suicide, but have successfully overcome the sweet allure of that easy path in light of the trauma it would inflict on my brothers and mother. It's so difficult to not feel emasculated when I cry, but it's so difficult to resist crying. 
     I feel like a self-entitled loser. But I have no idea how to battle my psychological issues or my real life ones. I'm deathly scared of being diagnosed as a narcissistic, bipolar maniac..I don't want to be labelled as mentally ill. It would just crush me even further into this desolate pit I've dug for myself."
