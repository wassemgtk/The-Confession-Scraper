I am junior on second semester. I am really trying to get out of my comfort zone meet more people, but I am so scared to go out and put myself out there. I don't want to be judged and I seem to avoid it, because I know I will be judged anyway. I just want some friend that I can talk. Just everything. Someone that I truly can trust, not just someone who says hi and bye but an actual human being who can understand the way I am. Where can I meet this person?
