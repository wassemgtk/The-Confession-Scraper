I wish people care about me. 

I would love for someone to message me and ask me "how are you?" but genuinely. 

my opinions are worthless, my hardwork pointless and what i think is insignificant.

I cant even enjoy a "break" without shit coming my way or being judged by just resting, heck expect too much from me.

I wish someone cared for me.

(PS this is the saddest confession i have written but i cant stand it anymore.)
