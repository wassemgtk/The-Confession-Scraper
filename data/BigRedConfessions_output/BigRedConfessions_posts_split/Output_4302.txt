In response to #3790 -

You are 100% not alone in the way you feel, because I feel the same way every single day. I never know if being with girls or guys is what's going to make me happy. And the worst part is, there's no one to talk to that understands.

I would have commented on your post so that we could talk about it, but what's even more messed up is I don't want to be judged by people for feeling the way we do. I feel you, dude, and I would love to get to know you so we can at least have each other.
