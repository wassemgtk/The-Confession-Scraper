"All my life I have put other people before myself and I've been miserable. Why should I do my best to make sure other people are happy when they can't see how much I suffer? I always offered myself up ready to do as much as I could to support people - but you know what? I'm not a pushover. If people want to trivialize me then they're not worth my time so I'll cut them from my life. 

Good things seem only to happen to bad people so maybe its time for me to be a lot more selfish.
