People who claim to hate one night stands without ever actually having had one infuriate me. Not because of the claim itself, but because of the way they obnoxiously assert their piety and virtue. Do you really think you're better than me and more morally uprighteous than I am because you've never had a shameless hook up and slept the night? Do you really think my love life is inferior to yours? Get over yourself. It's fine that it's not what you're looking for, and I understand what it feels like to want something more, but when you begin labeling it as "easy" or use a judging tone to describe the people who have had one night stands then you're just being an obnoxious prude.
