"There has been a disconnect between us and it feels as though you are treating me as your friend again and not your love and I'm just a little pissed because when I start falling for you is when you decide to pull away turning our love into gray, dull, boring, weird, questioning what am I doing wrong? what am I doing here? What's going on?

But when you pull away, I follow because the last thing I want is for you to come to me tomorrow and say ""there's distance between us."" So yea, if I follow I don't care if people call it clingy because I see it as chasing something retreating. Fighting for my dream, shes receding and I am not the man to stand idle as the fire of our love begins depleting.
Yes, LOVE. 
Yes, I LOVE YOU.
Yes, I will do ANYTHING for you 
I will break through the walls that are building between us
Chase you through the forest of lies and secrets
Battle through the harsh hollowing winds of ""Go away! You won't understand! There's nothing you can do!"" 
Until I find the you that smiled for no reason, at me, randomly
Kissing me, hugging me, trusting me to be your everything
So, yes, when you try to retreat, recede, and deplete behind your walls, into your forest, through the winds..
I follow you. I grab for you. I hold you tight and I look you in the eyes and say...
I'm not going anywhere"
