To the guy who posted on HONY about people not liking him for being active on Piazza and trying to help people:

I think it is great that you try to help people.  Even though others might make it seem like you're a know-it-all, at least you try to help people! People should learn to not be isolated, unhelpful assholes who don't even look at those walking by them.  

And anyone who says negative things about someone behind their back (or in your case, right in front of them in class) needs to look in a mirror and realize they aren't God's gift to creation and their judgment doesn't mean anything.

You do you.
