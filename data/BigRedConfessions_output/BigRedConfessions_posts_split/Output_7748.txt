I'm a traditional girl from a traditional family.  I'm sick of guys thinking I'm some sort of freak for being a virgin, or thinking I need "help" changing that.  I'm sick of explaining myself to frat boys that think I'm a prude when I don't put out.   I shouldn't have to justify myself to any of them.
