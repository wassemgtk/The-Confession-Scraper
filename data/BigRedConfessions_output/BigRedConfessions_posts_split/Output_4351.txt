"Dear Person,

Because you chose not to listen and keep arguing bullshit knowing that there's a truth behind my words, I will tell you here. If you see it, great. If not, let my feelings and thoughts rest here. 

You are too easily irritated by the simplest of things and call them stupid. As you say, ""stupid people do stupid things."" Sure that may be true, but your rigid perception on life closes your mind off to several other possibilities. You stick to crap that doesn't exist here in this world. Even if you hate groups of people, for example, freshmen, you have no right to ostracize them from your narcissistic world. If people do stupid things, you shouldn't be overflowing like the pacific ocean. I really don't give a fuck how you perceive people. I don't judge people based on their actions solely. 

You are the kind of person that talks so much shit and insults people thinking that many are beneath you. Bitch please... I could shut you down. Being that I have to deal with you everyday, I keep my mouth shut. It may even be the case that my fists would want to do the talking for me. 

Let it be known: You are no one to dictate anyone's happiness. You are no one to criticize anyone's happiness. You are no one to dictate anyone's lifestyle. You are no one to criticize anyone's lifestyle. So please do me a favor and shut the fuck up. My business clearly isn't yours. I'd avoid you but it's virtually impossible. 

And then you wonder why you are alone... even if you don't care, which is clearly bullshit, you push people away with imposing upon them your views. Stop that shit... seriously. I really don't care. 

Advice: If you change who you are, life will be so much easier and you won't be depressed nor unhappy. Maybe, you'll even attract friends. For now, perish in your void of self-ignorance. You stupid fucking piece of dick-shitted cunt looking ass motherfucker. Ugh... 

Sincerely,
Someone who has observed you closely for sometime now.

P.S. if you keep insulting the things I respect, I will be relentless with my barrage of spearlike words when I attack you. "
