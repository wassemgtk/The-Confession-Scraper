I'm an upperclassmen virgin guy. I would love to have sex. I would want my first time to be with a girl who is more experienced than I am and who I am comfortable enough with so that she can guide me through having sex and teach me how to make it a great experience for both of us. I JUST DON'T KNOW IF THESE GIRLS EXIST. Are there willing, experienced girls out there who wouldn't feel weird about walking a guy through his first time?
