My neighbor on my hall keeps playing rap music super fucking loud at night, and even though I haven't yet seen him, I really hope he's not black. Because I am, and he should know how badly that is going to make us both look. Why? In part because the world is a terrible place full of oversimplification of human beings. But also because, rap or not, loud or not, he's just showing NO RESPECT for his fellow hall-mates. Dude, seriously...
