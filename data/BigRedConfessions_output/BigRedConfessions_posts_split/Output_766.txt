So guess what, undergrads. Listen up carefully. I graduated in May of 2015, with a 3.90 gpa in Biology. Worked my ass off. And right now I'm not exactly where I thought I'd be in my life. I'm in a tech position that doesn't appreciate my smarts at all or utilize my skills, that I thought would help me get somewhere, but hasn't, and it's been made clear recently to me by the incredibly "emotionally fluctuating" PI that it won't. I can't even read the shit on this page, or the yikyak at cornell or anything anymore. I hate to pull this...but none of you understand what it's like after graduation. Getting those grades? Freaking out and stressing so much about them? Isn't going to make an ounce of difference. You're going to graduate. Whoop de f*cking do. And then you're going to get thrown into the real world. And if you were an introvert like me in college, at least professor-wise, you're not going to be able to land shit. I didn't network, and now I'm not utilizing my skills, and i'm making $15 an hour. My advice? Stop worrying so much about your goddamn grades and start making sure professors like you, like you enough to help you get where you want to go. Don't end up where I am. Don't end up like this. Ivy league doesn't mean anything if you don't have connections. You've been warned.
