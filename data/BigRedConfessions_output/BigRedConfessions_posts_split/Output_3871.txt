I find it disheartening and discouraging that I seem to be quite attracted to the women who are always so busy doing amazing things, helping others, leading a dozen clubs, accomplishing their dreams (which are my favorite qualities) that they hardly have the time to go out for a little coffee date or dinner. I'm not asking to hook up or a long term relationship right off the bat. I just simply think you are super cool and wish to get to know you more. Is it just me or has dating culture on campus simply died because no one has time for it anymore? Ladies and gentlemen, any thoughts?
