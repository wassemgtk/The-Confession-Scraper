Soon after a breakup I found you. I thought you were the one despite the timing and despite my best efforts to keep you a rebound. But now I realize you are on the beginning of your 1/4 life crisis and are rapidly changing to somebody I hate. Somebody close minded but not even strong willed enough to be a curmudgeon. Please don't become that person, or was I just wrong about who you are?
