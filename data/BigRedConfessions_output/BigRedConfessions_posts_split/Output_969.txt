I’d really love some help. From anyone. 

As children, most of us want to make our parents proud. And that’s what I want. More than anything in the world. 

And I know that I’m not. I’m not making them proud because I’m failing here. I did really well in high school and managed to get here. I guess up to that point, it was easy for me. 

My parents aren’t rich. At all. They can barely afford Cornell and I try to pay as much as I can with my job. But they put everything on the line and just work so very hard for me. My older dad works in a different city than my mother and my mother went back to strenuous work at the age of 60 just to help with the costs.

I’ve always had the dream of being a doctor. I can’t imagine myself doing anything else in the world. Having been a healthcare worker in my hometown, I know that this is the only thing I could ever want. And so naturally, I joined the hordes of vicious pre-meds.

But as a sophomore student right now? My GPA stands at an outstanding 2.082. It just sickens me. My entire freshman year I was freaked out of my mind, stressed beyond anything, and just unable to get good grades. My letters came in D’s, C’s, and a few minority B’s. That year’s performance has depressed me beyond anything. I no longer feel happy about anything. In any way. 

My parents were upset, of course. But they aren’t the kinds of people to scream at me and hit and threaten me. I thought they would do that. But no, they were upset, and supported me after. Tried to make me smile, just simply told me “it’s okay. You’re just going to have to get better grades next year. Okay? Please do that, you have to”. 

And of course I want to. I need to. I pushed myself this semester so very hard to. Even to the point that I took the organic chemistry lab class without the lecture portion (because I still had to take general chemistry due to not being able to complete the general chem sequence last year) just to trying to show initiative. 

I’ve gotten much better grades this year, but my GPA will only be a 3.5. Which would only raise my overall GPA to 2.5. 

I’m trying. I really am. But I’m depressed. So severely depressed, yet I walk up that damn hill every day to go to these classes that seem impossible for me to compete in and get med-school worthy grades. 

When my parents smiled at me this Thanksgiving break, laughed for me, did everything they could to take me out to dinner and movies, and outings, despite me pleading for them not to, because of the costs, and because of me knowing I didn’t deserve anything? I just broke down inside. 

I couldn’t care less about myself. It’s my parents I care about more than anything. And I feel broken about how badly I have failed here. They know I have a dream and they want me to achieve that dream. But how can I? How can I considering how badly i’ve done my freshman year? And how slow and hard it will be to get my GPA to a good position??

I really wish killing myself was easy. To ease the financial burden on my parents. To erase the pain of a failure who probably won’t achieve their dreams and make their parents proud. 

My college has been so cold towards me on these issues. Restricting my classes and looking at me as a failure. Which I suppose I am.

Mum and Dad, I love you more than anything in the world. You sacrificed everything for me and all I want is to make you proud. 

I suppose I came to this page because crying isn’t enough. And I suppose I would just like a stranger’s impression of my situation. Or advice. I’d appreciate it so much.
