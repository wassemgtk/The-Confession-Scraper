Someone is sobbing in the library and it's making me feel very uncomfortable. I can't see you, but I hear you. I wish I could do something about it. If I walked over to you and tried to console you I think that would just be very inappropriate. But I wish I could. It'll be alright, don't cry :( You're making me want to cry now.
