I know without doubt that the only reason he friendzoned me is because I'm overweight. I shouldn't be upset, because it does show a certain shallowness on his part. However is this going to be the rest of my life unless I lose weight? Will I not even get a chance with guys I'm extremely compatible with just because of my weight?
