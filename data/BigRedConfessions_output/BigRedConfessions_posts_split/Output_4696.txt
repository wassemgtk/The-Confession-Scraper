I'm very surprised when running into random people shouting dirty words to me in CTown. I don't expect everyone in Cornell being motivated and ambitious to be some kind of leader, but I'm still super disappointed. Is this where I go to school? Anything wrong with the school or me myself? Does this show the "selective"  or "rigorous" admission process is completely a joke? Why are there immature people who don't understand basic respect and politeness to others that they even don't know? I don't care whether they are drunk because no matter what, this is not acceptable. I have to reposition what Cornell should be like in my mind, since maybe it's actually just not as good as I thought. I hope to graduate from this place as soon as possible.
