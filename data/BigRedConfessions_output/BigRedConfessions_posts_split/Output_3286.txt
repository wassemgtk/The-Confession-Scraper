I saw you again today. Don't you know what seeing you does to me? My heart starts beating faster and a lump forms in my throat. It usually ruins my entire day and week and I can't focus. I always get bad news after seeing you. I try avoiding you as much as possible. This would be easier if you didn't hang out in the engineering quad so much. You're not even an engineer! We can never go back to the way it was freshman year and that hurts me. It's too bad we have a lot of mutual friends so I see you even when I don't want to. Your Facebook posts show that you have many friends. I haven't been that lucky and so maybe I'm jealous. I really hope you are graduating this year like you planned so I don't have to see you next year. You're bad luck. I never thought I would hate someone so much. Please do yourself a favor and avoid me as much as possible. Seeing you brings back memories that hurt and I'm already depressed enough. So, please. I'm begging you with what little strength I have left.
