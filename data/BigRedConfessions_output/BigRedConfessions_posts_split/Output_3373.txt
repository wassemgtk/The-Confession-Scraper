i came into cornell a gay virgin and I wanted to explore my sexuality (I think I'm bisexual now). There was a guy who I found on grindr and he seemed cool and I had sex with him. Later he said I was being too impersonal but really he was the one who had sex and never made any real effort to get to know me. Kind of turns me off to the whole gay culture.
