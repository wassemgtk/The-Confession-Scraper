You might consider that maybe I'm just not attracted to you, you need to start taking care of yourself because even though personality does go a long way I'm not going to be proud to date a hypocrite who completely denies that looks don't matter while she judges everyone else and doesn't even take time to look in the mirror. I like the confident way my girlfriend treats herself when she puts on makeup in the morning, the way she flirts with the mirror and when she stands up ready to conquer the day. Our personalities align well, which will never happen with you. Sorry but give up, I have no intentions of breaking up with her just because you have a crush on me or because you have the backwards notion that I should only be dating Asian girls.
