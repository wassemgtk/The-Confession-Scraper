For any given semester, there's always these same group of people (~4-5) that I see every week. It's just the way my schedules and their schedules work out. They always seem familiar to me, and I always seem familiar to them. We always exchange some sort of weird eye contact. I wish I could meet these people. Now that I think about it, I wish I could meet a lot more people on campus. People here seem very interesting to me and I'd love to talk to them. But things just never happen that way....
