I was completely content just playing the field, but you changed my mind, made me feel something, made me think you felt something too and wanted more. I know you're scared and that this is all new to you, but you hurt me by being committal one moment and non-committal the next, and threw away an opportunity for something more. I deserve better than that and I won't be a rag doll to anyone ever again, so bye.
