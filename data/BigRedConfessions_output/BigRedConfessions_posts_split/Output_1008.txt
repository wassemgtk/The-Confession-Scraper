I can't stop thinking about you. Ever since I broke up woth you you're the only person on my mind. I wish we could have ran away from this school and got married when we had the chance. I think I want to spend the rest of my life with you, I just know that will never happen. You wouldn't give me another chance. I wish I never joined a frat in the first place. They changed me. You know the person I really am. I love you, and that really eats me up inside. I guess I will see you in class next semester. It will be hard seeing you everyday of the week.
