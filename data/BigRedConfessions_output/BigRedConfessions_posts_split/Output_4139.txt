Why do guys want to do anal when there is a perfectly good vagina right there? I just don't get it. And don't use the "well when she's on her period" bit either, because why would you rather stick your dick in shit? Like literally shit. I don't want to have to clean that off of my bed before I go to sleep. And I don't want to have to take something to make sure my system is all flushed out and clean so a mess doesn't happen. And yeah, yeah, I know, "well sometimes a girl's pleasure nerves wrap around to the-" mine don't. I get no benefits from sex in this area. And don't get me started on the potential infections. Like just from poking the wrong area can get a lady's parts all sorts of bad. We're fragile and sensitive and how easy it is to get sick sucks. And this is coming from a lady that showers before and after. "Holy cow, what started this rant?" An attempt was made to try and pressure me into anal for like the third fucking time. Dude, seriously? I said no. This is a no fly zone. Please contact one of your other tinderbitches for that. I'll do everything else, but please, no. If I ever change my mind, I'll let you know.

Ok, I know why people do it, and people can do whatever they want. If that's what they like, top notch. Awesome, more power to them. I just needed to rant about why I don't want to do it, and how frustrating it is to be told to "come on, just do it" for ten minutes. Like yeah, that's a great way for me to never call you again. I can get over one ten minute period of that, but three more times holy fuck I will shove a fucking dildo up your ass when you're not prepared for it and see how you like it.
