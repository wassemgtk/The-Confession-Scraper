If you're feeling down because you're lonely, your grades aren't ideal, your professional network is non-existent, your job prospects are dreary, you have issues with your family, a romantic life is a distant dream, you're depressed, you can't find motivation where you used to find it, etc. Do this:

Squat, bench press, bent-over row, eat well, sleep well, take a day to rest, then squat, overhead press, deadlift, eat well, sleep well, take a day to rest, repeat.

And watch your troubles disappear. Protein and AC/DC also help.
