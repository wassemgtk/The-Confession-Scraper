Cornell has a lot of feminists.

I have studied gender and race issues a lot, and recent (i.e. not the original 1980s glass ceiling study) studies show that white women are no longer at an economic disadvantage. Short of personal choices (having kids & being stay at home moms, studying a low-paying major) white women have achieved economic equality.

So why is it that feminists here primarily focus on the economic issues of white women? Why not focus on social issues, such as sexual assault? Why not focus on the very real economic issues of minority women, or just minorities in general?

I love feminist women. But not the white ones that only ever talk about the glass ceiling, in their own context.
