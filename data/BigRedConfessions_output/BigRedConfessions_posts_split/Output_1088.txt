To the author of #6934:
I, too, feel the same way about joining the Big Red Marching Band.  It was truly the best decision I've made my entire semester.  Had I not joined the band, I don't think I would have made it through the semester without a mental breakdown (because I wouldn't have had such an amazing group of friends).  It'll be a sad moment as the season ends after this weekend's Penn (sucks) trip, but at least I know I will have friends to talk to next semester.  Conversely, it will be nice to have — you know, bandies — a few extra hours each week for prelim-studying and paper-writing next term.  I look forward to the next 3 years in the BRMB and meeting the classes of freshmen that come with that.
