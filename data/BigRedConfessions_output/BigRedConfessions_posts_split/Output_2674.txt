I spent this week with family in another part of the country, and realized that there are parents out there who are encouraging of their children instead of screaming at them and beating them when they don't live up to expectations. There are parents who listen to their kids. There are parents who are fair and consistent with rules. There are parents who, when their kids don't get a good grade, sit with their kid and help their kid figure out what to do next time to do better instead of punishing them, withholding food, or hitting them. And now I feel really sad. Because those parents weren't my parents, and I never knew that what I went through wasn't normal. I just know that when I have children, I know what I'll do. And it won't involve putting them down or physically abusing them.
