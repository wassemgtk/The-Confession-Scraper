It used to be that it was the strong husband's job to raise the family right and provide discipline. This included corporal punishment for the children or wife if they acted up. Families grew up strong and many times the husband would hug and kiss his wife after providing the discipline. It was not meant to hurt anyone but to instill better behavior. I think it provided a husband with an intimate way to discipline his wife. This is why families grew up stronger back in the day as my grandmother told me once, where divorce was not as prevalent. I discipline my girlfriend because she also grew up in a traditional setting and she wants to continue this intimate relationship when we get married in a couple of months because she said it will instill a stronger relationship, especially when I take on the man's job of also discipling the kids. Call me traditional, but whatever, I'm not the one that will need a divorce lawyer in a couple of years because my girlfriend and I will have a strong healthy marriage into the future 'till death do us part.
