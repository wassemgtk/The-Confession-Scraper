I have been thinking about you a lot lately. Even though we haven't truly spoken in over a year. You cared about me so greatly. And I have never been in a relationship that worked so well. At least it did when we were physically together. But our issues stemmed from the fact that I was a dumb and scared 19 year old. The idea of me just ending my life there just felt wrong. Now I know I could have began ours instead. But instead I fought your love. I fought our future. I am not saying I love you today, because its been too long and that is just creepy. I am just saying, what if I tried harder. What if I could have just been happy with you, knowing that you made me happy, including all of your awkward cuteness. I just keep thinking about how we argued eating dinner at Appel, one minute talking massive shit to one another, and the next holding hands because we that is just how we got along. I thought there was better out in this world. But I didn't really look at how amazing I already had it. When I found the one person who I could fall asleep with the moment you were in my arms, because you just fit there so right. I know that no matter what I do, I probably lost my chance. My mistake, the one that I will have to live for the rest of my life, was not fighting for you when all you wanted was for me to show you that I cared. I am not exactly saying I miss you, because I don't even know who you are today. But I do miss us, what we had, and wish I wasn't such a fool 2 years ago.
