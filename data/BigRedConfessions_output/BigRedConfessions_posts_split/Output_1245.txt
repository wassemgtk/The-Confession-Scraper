My boyfriend is usually pretty great, but something happened reciently that made me rethink our relationship (not cheating or anything of that sort). So im sitting here, studying, and comtemplating whether I should end it. But the problem is, with all that has happened in my life reciently, I am completely numb and exhausted. I haven't eaten in the last 24hrs (which never happens because im a foodie) and my go to spirit lifters are doing nothing. Im like a shell. I have no emotions, no cares, and the scary thing is, im enjoying it. ( note: my bf is not the direct cause of these feelings, he is just another straw in the bail that broke the camels back).
