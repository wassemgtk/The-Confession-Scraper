Call me an asshole for saying this, but there are some people who I just don't like and I can't figure out why. It's like my brain wants to like them, because they're perfectly good people who've done nothing wrong, but my heart and gut are screaming NO. And this is purely due to the "aura" they give off, which is usually a combination of their overall personality and tastes. I genuinely wish I wasn't so judgmental (granted, this only happens to a small percentage of people I meet, but still significant enough). There's already so much hate in the world, and I'm unfortunately only adding to that :\ I wish a professional could analyze why I feel this way, and whether this is a normal, "human" instinct to have.
