My parents were abusive. By my sophomore year of high school I was placed in foster care and moved through a couple homes. Of course my poor grades were the reason I got rejected ED this year. But one day I WILL transfer to my dream school. I WILL be a Cornellian. I'm just afraid I'll be made fun of for being a transfer...that I'll have a horrible time adjusting because its hard to make the same kinds of bonds with people when you haven't been there since the beginning.
