White people need to learn how to act around minorities. Minorities spend their entire lives learning how to get along with white people, and white people dont care to learn about others at all. Like how hard is it to not want to wear black face and not use the n-word. Then they want us to be their tokens so they can "learn" or look good to others but those minorities just end up having to appease them more. It's crazy
