I lie about myself so that I can impress others. I lie about my major, my talents, and my activities so that I can paint (what I think) is the best possible image of myself to others. I work hard to make sure none of the lies unravel, and I like that people find me mysterious. I have no regrets, but I don't think that I can ever have any serious relationships, because I'll never be able to share my true self with others.
