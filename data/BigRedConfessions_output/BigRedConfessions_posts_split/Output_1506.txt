This weekend was my second time trying weed. I tried it one time before that with some friends and enjoyed the feeling of hapiness it gives. But this time I smoke too much too fast and I really thought that I was gonna die. It was like my saoul got out of my body and was watching the whole scene of me paniquing from outsidemy body. I was so scared I thought of my family, my mom and my sister, and how sad would they be if I die. My friends were scared to call 911 so they just covered me with comforters because I was shaking so much and stayed around me until I got back to my normal state. This was THE worst experience and memory of my whole entire life and I made a promiss to myself to never ever touch drugs anymore.
