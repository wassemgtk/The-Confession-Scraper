I have confidence issues and often find that I doubt myself during difficult times. So whenever I take a prelim, I always mentally repeat these words: "I am not a dumbass. I am not a dumbass. I am not a dumbass." That mantra, as depressing as it sounds, is the only thing that helps me finish exams on time. LOL.
