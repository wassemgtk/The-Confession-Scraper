"At this point, I prefer not to express to any girl that I find her ""cute"" or ""attractive."" I haven't found anyone who wants to be my girlfriend yet and quite honestly, it's pretty sad. It's frustrating that someone doesn't want to completely open up to me both physically and emotionally- I was talking to someone almost two years ago that was emotionally attracted to me, but she said that she wasn't attracted to me physically to a mutual friend.

When thinking about it, it makes me wonder why she wasn't attracted to me in this sense. I surely wouldn't want to force anything, but I can only conclude that she was using me for the attention and that she didn't care if our friendship ever developed into anything more serious, which hurts. I'm a human being, just like everyone else, and we all want to feel that someone actually gives a damn about us. 

Recently, I prefer to be single and sexually please myself whenever, instead of having to rely on someone else's emotions. However, porn can get boring lol, and I want something else. I can't find it now though."
