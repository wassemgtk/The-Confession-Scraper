I was born and raised in Beverly Hills, California, the best city in the world, and I think I’m somewhat insta-famous in the Instagram world. Until recently, I had thought I lived the best life in the world and that walking from Barney’s up Rodeo was cardio but I've realized something. Honestly, money can’t buy happiness. My Birkins aren’t going to hug me back at night and tell me they love me, even though sometimes I think they do and I drop $1,000 in personal trainer's fees only to complain with her. I need to take my life more seriously. Goodbye old me, hello new me!
