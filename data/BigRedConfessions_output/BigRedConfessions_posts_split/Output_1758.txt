I'm a freshman and I'm disappointed with Cornell so far. Don't get me wrong. The people are lovely. The campus is stunning. But the education I'm currently receiving doesn't seem to have a positive correlation with the 60k I'm paying. I don't know, maybe it's because moving here from South Korea, I expected so much more from America's higher education system. Sometimes, during lectures, I just think to myself, "Why the fuck am I paying money to learn from these unmotivated professors who clearly don't give a shit about undergraduate education?" I know there are some professors who are very enthusiastic and inspirational. But they seem to constitute the minority. In my intro to stats lecture, the professor literally read word for word from the textbook. Did I travel across the globe to hear this shit? Where the fuck is my money going to? To pay for audio recordings of textbook readings? I'm just so frustrated. I could easily learn more from the free lectures posted on khanacademy.
