"Whenever I hear a fellow Cornell student or a solider or really anyone who has moved away talk about how much they miss they family, and how they can't wait to go home for the holidays to see their family, and family this, and family that.... I really don't get it. I can't tell if all of them are serious or of it's just a very politically correct thing to say. I used to think it was the latter but I'm starting to think it's the former. You've lived with your family your ENTIRE life, you've shared a house with the same people for many long years, you lived in the same stupid place, you've had no control over your life for most of it, assuming you're around late teens to early 20s, and yes they loved you and supported you, but how the heck did you not dream of new places and advenures to discover on your own, and be your own person. The second you move away, you get nostalgic and can't wait to go back to that prison where your identity has been overdefined over years and years? I don't understand that at all.

I moved to America on my own when I was teenager, then I joined the military and traveled around the world for the next 6 years of my life, seeing things most people wouldn't dream of seeing. Now I am a student at Cornell and this great American adventure continues. My life got exponentially better after I left the boring place I grew up in. I didn't miss my parents or siblings or old acquantances once. I called my family a few times a year out of courtesy, but that was it. New things, new adventures, new places, that's what life is about. It's how I've always seen it. That's how civilization started and got to this point. That's what built this country - people saying ""screw you all, I'm moving to a different continent"". When I was a solider, I would constantly hear my brothers and sisters in arms talk about their families, home, how much they missed them... I never understood that. Never. I was always respectful, but I thought I was in some way superior to them, because I didn't feel this way. And when people asked me if I missed my family (that happened a LOT) I would usually respond - no, I didn't move half a world away to miss my family. And they wouldn't really understand... Now I'm at Cornell and I hear more of the same. So I'm starting to think there is something seriously wrong with me. And in most cases, people didn't even move to a different country. I just can't fathom how you weren't dying to get out there and live your life, have some sense of adventure, stop thinking about all the things you were born with and get some new things..."
