I don't think you realize how badly you hurt me yesterday. All this time, I was holding out for you, because I thought you were a good person, worth waiting for, no matter that even your friends warned me against you. My best friends, though they've met you maybe twice, understood what you really are, and I feel like the world's biggest idiot for taking so long to catch on to that.

I have to admire your skill at breaking hearts though. Now that I have some distance from yesterday - hats off to how casually cruel you were, almost unconsciously, really. Just know this - you haven't broken me. I'll be back in your life at some point, untouchable, and then you'll know what you did to me. Until then, don't bother. Things are going to be on my terms from now.
