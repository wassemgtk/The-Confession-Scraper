I don’t know why I am writing this, maybe I just want to vent or have someone I know read it and know it’s me. Ever since the beginning of this semester an emptiness has been growing inside of me. I have tried to fill it drugs and alcohol but they only alleviate the feeling for a while, then it just returns as if nothing changed. It is funny, I have even tried going to the library to alleviate the emptiness, and maybe if I had something to do to work at it would fill it somehow. I feel so purposeless as if I do not have a reason to exist I have no calling. Everyone I know has a passion a something they are passionate about but I do not I find nothing interesting the only thing that gets me by is a rush of adrenaline a façade of being edgy. It is almost as if the edginess of my persona will make the emptiness acceptable as a role to fulfill.
