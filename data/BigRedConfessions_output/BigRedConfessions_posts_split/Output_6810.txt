I seriously think I'm in love with this girl. We've only been together for a short time, but holy shit. Every time I see her I get butterflies and just realize I do not deserve her by any means. She puts up with all of my shenanigans ( drinking, smoking, nicotine addiction) but at the same time makes me want to be a better person. I never thought I could have feelings like this for a person, but then again I never thought I could get a girl like her.
