My time at Cornell is about to come to a close, with graduation around the corner. Every day that passes in this last lap teaches me something new about life, and more specifically, about life at Cornell. Today's lesson: If I were to die the day after I graduate, none of the "friends" I have made here would care. Most people here have no depth. This makes my decision to go back home to my family, forever, after graduation the perfect decision. Every second in which I suffer, my family suffers with me. Every second in which I rejoice, they rejoice with me. Whoever said blood is thicker than water was damn right.
