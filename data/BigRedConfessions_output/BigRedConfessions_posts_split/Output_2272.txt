That point in the night where you're wondering it's actually worth it to do the homework.

It's either stay up a couple more hours and finish it or don't do it and lose points (or in my class, get yelled at by the teacher)

Oh wait, this is only the first homework I've started tonight. Another shit ton for another class. 

FML!

PS. No I was not lazy, I had to study for another class before I could do my homework
