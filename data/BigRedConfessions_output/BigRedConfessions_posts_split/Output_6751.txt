I completely feel for the guys who've posted about the frustrations of being a "nice guy". The truth is though, the rejections we girls hand out usually have very little to do with how nice or not nice of a guy you are. It's very shallow, but simple -- it all comes down to appearance. If a girl gets along with you really well and you guys seem to click very well but she STILL friendzones you and indicates that she doesn't see you as more than a friend, literally the only reason that could be is that she isn't attracted to you sexually, which means you're not physically appealing to her. Sure, she might actually just not like you as a person, but assuming that you guys do actually get along very well, there's no other reason for her to turn you down if it's not a physical thing. So no, becoming a jerk isn't going to make you any more attractive; if anything, you'll just be an ugly jerk.
