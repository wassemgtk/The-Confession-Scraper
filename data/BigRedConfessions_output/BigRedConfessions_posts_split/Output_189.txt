I fed a homeless man today. And before anyone says anything, I'm not looking for approval or compliments. I was on the bus and I saw his sign so I went to Starbucks to purchase the most fulfilling thing Starbucks has, which limits options tremendously, and I walked back to the other side of the commons to give it to him. My only concern is that this is the only thing he's going to eat for a while. I've been homeless before and I lost my faith in humanity. I have to pretend like I'm not poor to impress people at Cornell, only my best friend knows the truth. The world is unforgiving, I just hope someone else will be kind to him.
