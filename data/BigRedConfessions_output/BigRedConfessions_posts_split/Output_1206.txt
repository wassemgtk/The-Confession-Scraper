Let me first start by saying that I do not choose to be "the special snowflake". My existence is actually very lonely.

I grew up feeling alienated from other kids because I always felt like I was too "smart" and I couldn't relate to them. I feel like I am just wired that way, you know? In fact, the last time I checked my IQ, it was actually 138. I am an over thinker and I love to talk about ideas and science. While I like to go to parties to have fun with drunk people, the only people I can be "friends" with are those who I can have deep conversations with. 
This is why I worked my ass off to get into an ivy because I thought I could finally feel at "home". And I did. It was amazing. Now that I've graduated from Cornell, I'm back to feeling like an alien again. My brain wiring makes me feel like everyone is so...superficial, and I have really tried to relate to them, but I just can't. What should I do? I'm really considering doing PhD in the future to feel "home" again.
