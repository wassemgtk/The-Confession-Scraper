I am a pathological liar. For years, I've had this problem. I've used it to make friends, to hook up at parties, to forge connections, and to do basically everything I felt I could not do with my own personality. But now, I've created a lie that is simply too great to apologize for. I can't tell you what it is at the risk of employers and friends seeing the page and judging me for it. I guess it's a constant struggle with envy of what other people have, my own personal struggle with self-worth, and my sexual frustrations, all combined into one massive personal insecurity. If anyone can tell me how to proceed with this, please let me know.
