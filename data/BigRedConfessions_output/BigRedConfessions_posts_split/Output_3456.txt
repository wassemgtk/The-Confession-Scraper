I was turned away from a several of companies from career fair today simply because of my GPA (last semester didn't go s well) I was disappointed and angry at first, but I now see this as an opportunity to better myself. Although it seems impossible, I am going bring my GPA out of the abyss by earning all A's this semester.... in engineering. I will accept nothing less. May God grant me strength.
