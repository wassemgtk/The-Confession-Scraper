I am so worthless, my breath always smells no matter what I do I guess and no one wants to be around me. I will never find a friend. Everyone just moves away and know I know why because someone told me today that I will never find a gf because of it. I tried going to doctors, and dentists and no one can even help me with it since they can't tell the cause. My teeth are healthy, since I always brush them and I never had a cavity even. I am confused. Today when someone told me to my face that I am a loser because of it and that I will never find a gf because of it, it hit me as if I walked into a wall. I just wanted to cry but I had class almost all day. When I came home to my dorm I just let it out. Luckily, I can just stay inside for today, cry, and  eat what I have in my room because I have nothing else to do besides homework, and because I am ashamed. There is nothing I could probably do I am such a loser, no matter what I try to eat and to use breath mints, good toothpaste and mouthwash.
