So I have a fear that if I don't remember to capitalize the proper noun names used in orgo for my write ups, the guys who's names they belong to will damn my grade. Like, if I forget to capitalize "Pasteur" in "Pasteur pipette," Louis will roll over in his grave and make sure I get a D on my report.  So I never forget to capitalize their names.
