As someone who habitually pees in the shower, it's been really hard this year for me to suppress my urges. I live in a suite with my friends, and I see some of them showering without slippers on, so I know I shouldn't do it. But every time I turn the water on, the temptations rush back to me. I haven't yet, but I don't know how long I can keep this up.
