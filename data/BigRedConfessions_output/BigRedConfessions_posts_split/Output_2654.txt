I suffered from chronic anxiety. I always picture the worst things that will happen to me (rejections, rebuffs, etc.) in my mind, especially when it comes to dealing with other people. Positive reinforcement didn't help at all. Thanks to my anxiety, I lost a lot of friends who eventually got fed up dealing with me. I could not get involved in a relationship for fear of getting rejected and bringing misery to my partner. I retreated to my own world just so that I won't screw up everyone else with my pessimism. I could only blame myself and the negative energy in me. I thought of ending my own life to liberate myself from this anxiety and others from the negative energy I am giving them. Besides, I don't see myself surviving in society either as a social outcast.
