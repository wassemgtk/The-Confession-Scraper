Hey premeds, what does it mean when I have difficulty getting up in the mornings, increased appetite and difficulty concentrating sometimes? Like I'm never not hungry. Am I dying, webmd is saying all types of stuff. Also, I'm definitely not pregnant. I thought it was pms, but I'm still experiencing symptoms. Help.
