When did people become so rude to others? I am talking about people who are coming your way on a sidewalk and make absolutely no attempt to adjust how much space they are taking. Even if I adjust for them, I still end up getting shoulder checked with rarely an apology or opps. I you think it makes you look cool and in charge, think again. You just look like an asshole.
