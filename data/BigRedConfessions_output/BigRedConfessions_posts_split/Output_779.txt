With rush coming up I'm so nervous about what it's like joining a sorority. There seem to be a lot of resources and information available for guys for recruitment, but not much for girls. My guy friend went to a greek info session on whats its like to be LGBT and greek, but it was only focused on frats. Will my possible sisters accept me for who I am? I'm scared if I go greek I'll just have to go back into the closet.
