I am an incoming transfer student and this page is seriously depressing, not to mention rampant with third world problems. The confessions page at my last university was crazy funny with a little depression peppered in. Is this supposed to be a whining fest or can I confess my erotic love of economics here? Increasing American GDP gets me hard... is that weird?
