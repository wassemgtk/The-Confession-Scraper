I love my boyfriend, but he keeps touching me and trying to do stuff to me while I sleep. The moment I wake up to try to fool around with him, he pretends like he was sleeping. I've confronted him about this before, but he's always dismissive about it. It keeps happening though. Should I just pretend I'm sleeping next time?
