"I'm kind of fucked for this semester. THere were some classes I completely stopped going to, and major assignments in two that I never turned in. Sometimes it was so hard to get out of bed in the morning that I barely went to class for weeks. I have no idea what I'm doing here, and I've lost all motivation. I've been doing a pretty good job of keeping this issue at bay and not thinking about it, but I don't know how long I can keep doing this. I worry all the time that I won't be able to come back next semester. 

I'm scared.
