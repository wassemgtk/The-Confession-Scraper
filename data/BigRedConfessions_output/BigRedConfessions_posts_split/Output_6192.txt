"Dear friends, 

I'm really sorry if I've come off as flaky lately. Don't believe for a second it's you, it's 100% me and the fact that I don't have my shit together and have no idea how to reach out about not having my shit together. If you liked who I was when I DID have my shit together (whenever that was), then it might be worth it to you to reach out to me if you have the time and energy (and I understand if you don't, because this is Cornell and I don't even have time to be writing this post). I'm honestly not sure who I can rely on and I'm not sure if I've tried with the wrong people or if I've just gone about it the wrong way with the few people I have opened up to.

Side note: #1967, maybe try being patient with whoever you're talking about, and try to not overanalyze and connect any action you're not happy about with the person's feelings towards you.
