"I have a question to all you feminists out there:

I recently watched a video of a woman walking through the streets of NYC being cat-called by multiple men from a variety of neighborhoods. The video can be seen here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1XGPvbWn0A
Although many of the people in this video said things of a veiled sexual nature, there were also more than a few who simply acknowledged her beauty and just wanted to greet her or ask her out. My question is this: what is the line between a compliment and harassment? Is it really a sin to approach a woman on the street and ask her out, even if your initial encounter with her lasts but a couple of seconds, if that even? I understand that pursuing a relationship should ideally be based on more than superficial attraction. But if the sight of a person does make your heart skip a beat, isn't it well worth the cost to ask her out just to see where it goes? Lastly, why is it a widely accepted paradigm in society that if a ""regular-looking, working-class guy"" exhibits such behavior in public it's considered harassment, but if a rich, powerful, modern-day casanova like George Clooney does it, it's considered a form of flattery for the woman?

-This was a real question btw. I wasn't being a sarcastic assclown. I think that many men are probably of a similar mindset. Sometimes we do things that are considered offensive out of ignorance, not out of malcontent or a conscious sense of superiority to women. Yet when there is an outpouring of criticism from feminist circles without proper reasoning, many men are kept either angry, confused, or highly cynical of the feminist movement in general.
