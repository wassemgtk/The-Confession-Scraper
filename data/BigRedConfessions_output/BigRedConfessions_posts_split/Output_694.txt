The tipping culture in the US is strange and unfair. It was one of my first WTF moments when I moved here, along with cars are essential appliances (but I won't go there). In Europe, you generally round up, and that's the tip. If the bill is $24.50, you leave $25. Here anything under 15% is rude. That's a lot of money. I'm not saying the people don't deserve it, but there are a lot of minimum wage jobs where people deserve extra for their effort and don't get it. It seems very arbitrary to give money to waiters, taxi drivers and barbers for doing their job. I'd rather tip the child who made my phone, or a busy retail worker who has 10 people asking them questions, and yet finds time to deal with my problem, or a customer service rep on the phone who's particularly helpful, or people who work at self-service restaurants -- they also clean tables and prepare my food. Table service restaurants actually lose my business most of the time, because I am essentially taxed an extra 15% for eating there so I just go elsewhere. I wish this culture would end. Waiters are not underpaid, they actually make a lot more than the average minimum wage worker for essentially the same job, because of tips. Takeout is especially egregious -- I'm supposed to leave some guy $5.50 for driving 4 blocks to my building, and taking an elevator? I call BS on tips.
