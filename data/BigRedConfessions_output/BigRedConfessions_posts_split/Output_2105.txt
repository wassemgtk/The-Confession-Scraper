I'm taking a class where the final exam and midterm are worth 55% and 45% of our final grade, respectively. At the beginning of the semester I was really excited about the class, as it's a subject I find fascinating. I read all of the textbooks before the start of class, and when it came time for the midterm, I was sure I would do well. But then the exams were passed out--it was about 20 pages long, mostly short answer questions, and we had an hour to finish. After a moment of panic, I started writing as fast as I could. By the end of the exam period, despite writing frantically, I had only finished about 70% of the exam, and my grade reflected it: I barely passed. After that experience, I became disenchanted, because what's the point? I loved the material, worked really hard, and displayed great understanding of the material in class/discussion sections, but it didn't make a difference. I stopped attending that class, because clearly my time would be better spent on other classes. I stopped studying for hours on end, because it never helped. So many students complained about the midterm that the professor reluctantly decided that the final *might* be adjusted (i.e. slightly easier, shorter)...I don't think that anyone who works hard, loves the subject, and displays a good understanding of the material should ever feel that their grade is based entirely on luck. That being said, I'm hoping for a miracle.
