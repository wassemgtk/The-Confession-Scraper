There are a few people in my major that I envy so much that I almost hate them. Not because of anything they've done, but just because I'm so jealous of the support and love they are surrounded with. They post on their facebook about how they're so thankful for how amazing Cornell's been, and they have parents and family members and friends commenting about how happy they are for them, and how they deserve all of their success and happiness. They post collages of them and their friends, and write about how much they look forward to seeing their family and friends back home, but how they'll also miss all of the friends they've made here at Cornell. 
I know I'm just being petty and selfish, but the end of the year always reminds me of how alone I have been for another entire year. I wish I had someone in my corner. I also really want a hug.
