I can never tell with you. One minute, you're nice enough, though it's usually not directed at me. Then suddenly you swing into total bitch mode, and, oh, yeah, that one is directed at me. And I can handle it, cause apparently I'm better at getting the fuck over it. But I don't even know why you're so nasty to me. Like, what? Are you jealous? Either way, you're not something I'll miss when this semester is over.
