Am I the only person who still sticks to 1920's standards for dating? How's this for a date: I pick you up at your apartment and we go see a local play or maybe an art gallery. Afterwards we go a mellow coffee shop for post-show cappuccinos and talk about anything that comes mind. If things are going well, we can take the scenic route back to your apartment. I make sure you arrive safely at your door and if I'm lucky I can get a quick kiss on the check. Nothing more. If you're not too freaked out by the whole exchange, maybe we can go on another.
