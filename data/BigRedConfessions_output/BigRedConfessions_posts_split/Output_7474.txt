I am a server at a local late-night establishment in College Town, and just wanted to ask that you remember that while we want to create a fun atmosphere, we still have to maintain some amount of decorum and avoid getting in trouble or fired. Which leads me to my second point; we are at work for a reason, remember? I would like to have a fun night as well but work comes first and however much I make or don't make during a shift can make a big difference later on in my week. A sincere smile and a friendly conversation go a long way during hard, long late-night shifts. That being said, you Cornellians are a funny bunch and I love my classmates very much. We're all in this crazy mess of a school together; and gotta love y'all for that. For those of you suffering this winter like me, don't worry spring will come along soon enough (i hope). Stay groovy children.
