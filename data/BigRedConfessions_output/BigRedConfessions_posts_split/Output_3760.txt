I decided to take a leave of absence this semester to focus on my mental health. While I am devastated I am not allowed to return until the fall semester, I know it's for the best. The only thing I regret is probably never being able to see a guy I had briefly met because he is graduating in the spring. 

[Thanks for providing feedback!]
