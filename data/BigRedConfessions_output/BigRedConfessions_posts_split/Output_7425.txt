To the tall brown guy at Asian Night in the pink outfit, you're really handsome. I saw you for the first time at Casino Night and then, after a really long time, in the bus. I hope you're personality is as good as you look. Too bad I won't ever know, I'm too shy to ever say anything to you based on how many times we made quick eye contact and I passed right by you. Oh well...
