I walked through Goldwin Smith and Klarman the other day. I didn't know that they had moved Temple of Zeus into the new space and was super disappointed about it when I found out. I rather enjoyed stepping down into the old Temple at lunch or in the morning and having a coffee at the ricketing old tables. It made me feel like a part of old Cornell tradition. I liked to imagine sitting in the same spot as Vonnegut scribbled notes for the Daily Sun or did his class reading. That's gone now..
