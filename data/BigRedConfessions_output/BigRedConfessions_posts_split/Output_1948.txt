Sometimes I like to stand in the middle of the road at night hoping that maybe a car wil come speeding by and hit me. Life is fine. It's just there's nothing here really that I would want to fight to live for. Even my passions in life are slowly turning to boring hums in the background. All my life I've tried to develop and maintain my "defining characteristics" but honestly, if I disappear, someone else will come to take my place. The world has made that all too clear.
