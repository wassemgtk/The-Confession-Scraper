This semester has not started off well. I can't find motivation to do any of my work, and I'm not at all interested in most of my classes. Also, I am single, and sometimes (more and more) I feel like I'll always be alone. Whenever I feel happy or excited, I always come right back to that thought. I just don't have the confidence to actually ask someone else, and I just hope I can build it up before it's too late.
