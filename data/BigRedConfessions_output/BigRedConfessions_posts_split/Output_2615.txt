I bought a dildo recently because I wanted to see what the hype was all about and now I really, really want to have sex with someone. It hurt at first but now it feels soooooo good... and sex is supposed to be better! Only thing is, I don't have a boyfriend and hookup culture kind of scares me... you never know what a person is capable is of, you know? Ughh. I'm decently attractive, I'm sure there are guys out there who would be willing to have sex with me but like.... how do I find them? Ughhh hormones are just >_<
