I'm a quiet, unattractive person, and I'm beginning to think I'll be single for life. Oddly, I'm fine with this. However, I don't know if it's because I'm 1) Asexual, 2) Managed to so strongly convince myself I'll never be liked by anyone that I've shut all possibilities out, or 3) Just haven't met the right person yet. Another thing is, I'm terribly afraid of commitment, and I'm afraid to hurt people. As a result, I find it difficult to emotionally open up to people, and this includes my closest friends. I'm 21, and I can't imagine kissing or having sex with anyone. I can't imagine anyone caring about me, hugging me, or even touching me. In fact, I find the concept bizarre- or perhaps I've just alienated myself from it, believing it to be unreachable for someone like me. On the other hand, when I see couples around campus, I do occasionally wish I had someone who cared about me. I guess I'm just really confused.
