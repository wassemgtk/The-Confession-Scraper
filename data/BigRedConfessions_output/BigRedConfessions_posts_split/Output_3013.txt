So... I am here to confess something.

Just wanted to share the fact that I recently joined a fraternity and say that there aren't as "bad" as stereotypes show. Now that I am in the Greek system, I want to share what I have seen so far and what I recommend.

1. You can be of any race and culture. Any frat would gladly accept you for who you are. Something I have noticed (and maintained) is that being yourself during rush events will help a lot when brothers are deciding on whether to offer you a bid or not. Many students try to impress frat members but that doesn't really help. Be yourself.

2. You don't have to be rich to join one. I am not rich at all and joined one. As long as you can keep up with the fees (usually in the semester you become a brother you only pay for the new member fees and don't pay a dime until the following semester), you will be okay. If you have financial concerns, state that to other brothers as a reason why you'd not join one; they will help if they want you.

3. Lastly, most frats are not always about parties. Of course, they do have social times and everything, but if your parents are concerned about you partying too much, explain to them how do you feel about the frat you want to become a brother at. I did have issues with my parents, but I explained to them that a particular frat is not about partying, it's about brotherhood. If that still doesn't work, ask an active member to talk to your parents. I am sure they will understand. 

I know not everyone will agree with me but these are my perceptions so far. I became an active brother last weekend and I can tell is by far one of the best decisions I have ever made.
