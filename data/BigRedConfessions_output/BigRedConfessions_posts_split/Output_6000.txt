"Today when I was studying in a conference room on the 7th floor of Olin, a group of four people came in and started to talk. This quite got on my nerves, so I asked them if they used the room for quiet study or group discussion. To my surprise, they said this conference room was for group study, and there were other quiet rooms that I could use, and that others would be joining them soon. Not sure what they said about the conference room was right, I kind of backed down and left a few minutes later. Wanting to make sure, I explained the situation to a librarian at the circulation desk and she said the priority of any study area in the library is for quiet study, not to mention that I had been in the room before they came, and that I could ask them to keep quiet or else leave. She even offered to help me mediate the situation. As I didn't want to make another scene I just kindly turned it down.
Guys, next time if you are annoyed by the incessant talking near you in the study area of libraries (except the cafe area), feel free to hush them. If they don't listen or even claim what they do is OK, ask a librarian for help. They are happy to help you. By the way, that group of people really owe me an apology for misleading me."
