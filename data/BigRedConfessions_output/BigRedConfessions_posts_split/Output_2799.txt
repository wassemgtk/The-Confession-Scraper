I see a lot of posts on here and yik yak about people being depressed and stressed about college and not knowing if it's worth it and all that.

I just wanted to share my experience- I graduated last May, not from here granted, but I can tell you that everyone has those feelings, except the VERY few. Even those who you think have it together, really don't. Everyone is terrified to leave college and terrified of not finding a job and wasting their time and money here. And let me tell you that that's not true, you will not regret your time here and you will eventually find a great job. Especially since you all go to Cornell! I went to a state school, didn't get above a 3.5, didn't really put much effort into extracurriculars or making a ton of friends or partying all the time or networking, i didn't even have an internship during my 4 years. But i graduated and managed to get a research position here.
I had days, weeks, months even where I would slip into major depression just going home and crying after class and wondering wtf i'm even doing with my life.
Things will get better, I promise. It may feel tough now but it's so worth it. And maybe you don't get your dream job right after college, or even a real job in general right after college. But you're so young! Think of the people who have to go back to college in their mid 40's. You have so much time to figure things out and become who you want to become. Stop comparing yourself to others and believe in yourself! Things WILL get better!!
