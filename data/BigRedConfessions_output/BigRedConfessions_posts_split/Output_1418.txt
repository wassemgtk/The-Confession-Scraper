I feel like a lot of the misery at Cornell is self-inflicted. So much of it can be avoided if students just take a step back and evaluate what they want. There's no need for anyone to take 18 credits of crazy classes and destroy their GPA / future job prospects. As a senior, I have never felt overwhelmed or stressed during my years here because I took 12 credits of easy A classes every semester. That allowed me to do almost no homework and skate through classes with a decent GPA and with my free time, I was able to network and land a banking job at a top-tier firm. The kids in my classes who obsessed over grades and tests and classes are still struggling to find jobs. Anything you learn in class, especially if you're in A&S, will never be applicable in your job so just take easy and fun classes and relax. 

Cornell isn't about what you learn, it's about how much fun you have and what you get out of it.
