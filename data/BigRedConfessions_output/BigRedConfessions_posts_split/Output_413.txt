I love how my environmentally conscious liberal friend says that palm oil plantations are evil. I eat all kinds of baked goods made with palm oil and they are extremely yummy. I especially love Girl Scouts cookies too. Imagine how much life would suck without these efficient and beautiful palm oil plantations in Asia, since they are the basis of a lot of baked goodies, including my Boston Creme donuts, which I have for breakfast everyday as I take the 1 train to work.
