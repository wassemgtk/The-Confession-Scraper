"People say that I always look happy and positive. This does not mean that I never feel down. I've lost two family members in the past few months and things are falling apart at home. Only my closest friends know about this. I think that happiness is a cultivated attitude. It's ok to be sad and feel broken. But you should also learn to move on from grief. Whenever I feel like I can't possibly go through another day on this planet, I look through this list and always find a way to get out of my cocoon of sadness. It helped me, so I want to share it with everyone out there that might just need this little push to be happier. Let's all hang in there.
