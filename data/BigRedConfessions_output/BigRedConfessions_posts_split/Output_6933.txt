"I'm the kind of girl who doesn't put up with a lot of shit so I thought the quote ""guys treat you the way you let them treat you"" didn't apply to me... but recently I realized it does. Even though I don't let a lot slide and I let it be known when I'm upset, I'm never upset for long. What I need to work on is letting go; really following up with what I say by just cutting people off.
It's the truth; guys treat you the way you let them.
Want to be his girlfriend? Then stop being there for an easy access hookup.
Want him to stop being aloof? Then stop jumping at the chance to talk to him.
Girls don't realize it but by doing these things, guys get used to treating girls a certain way. Higher your standards and guys will be forced to meet them. And when they don't meet them (and I'm not talking love poems, chocolates, diamonds, or any other unreasonable standards; I'm talking RESPECT and common courtesy), just cut them off immediately. Someone's going to treat you the way you deserve to be treated, if only you're open to being treated that way."
