I feel like I owe two people so much for me ending up here. One was an advisor and the other was an ra for a program I was in while I was in while i was in high school that I don't think I would have made it here without. I don't know how to direct it at the people who helped me directly as they weren't supposed to help anybody outside of the Bay Area but the help helped me so much that I didn't know how to deny it later on. Either way  I just want to say thank you to everybody who has helped me along the way.
