I am in a prestigious society and I dislike how my colleagues evaluate our applicants based on how normal they are. Seriously, what does normalcy even mean? Does it mean to follow the trend and never question the world around you, or does it mean to be a bystander in the face of difficult decisions? I appreciate the unique qualities that each person can potentially bring into the group, and I will never judge people based on how normal they are. Please, appreciate the diversity of the world around you, and never conform or deny your personal values just so you can fit in. Be a leader and be courageous.
