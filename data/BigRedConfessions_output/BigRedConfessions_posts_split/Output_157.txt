I wish somebody could help me, but I know I have to solve this on my own. I have completely lost sight of who I am. I put on different personalities in different situations. I hate being so fake, but I can't stop it and I do not even know what my normal self is. I don't know if I can live like this. I don't have a purpose in life.
