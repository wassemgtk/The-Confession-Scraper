Sings
*When the night has come
And the land is dark
And the moon is the only light we'll see
No I won't be afraid, no I won't be afraid
Just as long as you stand, stand by me
Oh darlin', darlin', stand by me, oh stand by me
Oh stand by me, stand by me*

I just wanted to sing like Ben E. King to all of you. I like to sing his songs along with many other oldies, when I drink too many mint juleps. Once I did that at the Statler Hotel (Regent Lounge) when I spent too much money on drinks and appetizers. Oh, but at least I will have memories when I graduate, right? YOLO :P
