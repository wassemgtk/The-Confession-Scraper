I suspect one of my classmates is transgendered. I always referred to them as "he", today I discovered someone else referred to them as "she". I realized that I was potentially causing great offense to my classmate. I want to refer to them by their preferred gender pronoun (or if they prefer, none at all) but I don't know how to ask them. I think that person is amazingly kind, incredibly wise and very supportive, which makes my not knowing what they prefer feel worse. They deserve a space space and I am mortified by the thought that I may be unknowingly making things difficult for them.
