Despite the fact that I have applied to all of the internships that I have come across, I am getting nowhere. At this point, I will have to work my menial restaurant job in my hometown again because I am not stellar enough to even get a passing glance. I don't know how I can possibly be hireable in the future if companies don't even give me a chance.
