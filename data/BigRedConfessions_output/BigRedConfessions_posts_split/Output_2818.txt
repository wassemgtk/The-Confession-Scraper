My secret hobby is to observe people at the dining hall during breakfast.  Even though about 97% of the students are addicted to their laptops and phones, I find two or three people that have social conversations during  this time and it pleases me to see people taking their time to sit with each other and have a proper discussion (Everyone, please do this more often!).  

Especially since there is this particular girl-boy pair that aren't dating that I like to observe.  I have been getting a lot of hints from the girl that she is hopelessly in love with him while he is totally oblivious to her affections.  I wish there was some way to make it work for her.  Good luck!
