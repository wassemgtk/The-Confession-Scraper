I joke and laugh about being single my entire life but on the inside it's actually killing me. By "Single", I'm not saying I've never been in a serious relationship. I mean I've had absolutely zero encounters with anyone: no hookup, no kisses, no dates, no holding hands, no flirting, no one showing the slightest sign of interest. I've given up on ever feeling like someone will want me.
