I have a hot girlfriend and this causes me trouble. There is always someone interested in her. Men give her small gifts (such as chocolates the day after valentine's), invite her for 1-on-1 dinners,… ugh. They know about me but they still do it. My GF is mature and knows what she wants, making this clear to others; that is good. I am graduating and she is not… that can be a problem. However, I am a good boyfriend: I am always there, I cook for her and give her good presents. 

I know I shouldn’t be worried, but I was in her situation once. I had a great girlfriend, but I had someone else interested in me. When I had a fight with that GF, I thought about the other. Don’t judge me, I didn’t do anything.
