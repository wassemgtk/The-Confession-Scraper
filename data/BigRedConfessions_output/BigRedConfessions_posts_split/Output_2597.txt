This one goes out to all the people who do not understand the concept of bending the rules. You will encounter times in your life where you will be faced with the option of looking the other way to help someone out in a totally HARMLESS way, at the expense of not following some bureaucratic bullshit rule (i.e. you have to have your Cornell ID to get into a gym class- even if you have a gym membership and know your id number). Really think hard about how much it would hurt you to let one slide every now and then, while also considering how much you might be helping out a fellow human being. Odds are nothing will happen to you if you look the other way, and someone else will have been spared some distress. Don't be the cop that gives a ticket to a speeder every time, regardless of their excuse. Don't be that guy. Be a brain user, not a rule follower.
