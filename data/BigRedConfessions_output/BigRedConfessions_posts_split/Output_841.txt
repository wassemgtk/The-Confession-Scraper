To the guy that stopped on his way down the slope to check if I was okay when I was fake-fighting with my boyfriend for fun, thank you. I forgot to thank you in the moment because I was so surprised by your gesture but we really need more concerned people like you. I'm sorry if I alarmed you, my boyfriend is a wonderful guy who would never hurt me. But thanks again for looking out for me! :)
