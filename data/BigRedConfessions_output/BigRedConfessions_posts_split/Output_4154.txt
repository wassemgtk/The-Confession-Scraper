"I have these attractions towards guys yet I do not like labeling myself ""gay"". I feel like I don't even fit that label because of the stereotypes society makes of gay guys. I'm just an average looking guy who has feelings for guys at times. But the thing is, I really don't want to have these attractions. I feel like it's going to ruin my life and my family will never look at me the same anymore if I marry a guy. I know they won't reject me, but they will be very dissapointed in me. It's also caused a lot of pain in my past and current friendships by being attracted to my friends and being close to them yet knowing that you can never have them. Or anybody else that I like. Because I'm ""wrong"" and no one that I like will join me on that. Because they're right, I'm not supposed to be thinking these thoughts, I'm supposed to be straight just like they are.

And it saddens me that I cannot come to terms with these thoughts and that I'm surrounded by ""ideal"" guys that like girls. It sucks so badly. I know there are guys out there who wouldn't mind hooking up, but I have an even greater problem, I don't think that will make me happy.

I don't even know what will make me happy. But if I find that something or someone that does make me happy will I be right or wrong on that?
