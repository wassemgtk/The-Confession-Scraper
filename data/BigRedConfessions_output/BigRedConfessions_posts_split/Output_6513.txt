"It doesn't matter what you believe about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict or about the suggestion that Cornell should divest in certain companies. As a college student, this is the time to be an activist, the time to be interested and invested in political issues. Everyone should be outraged that the Student Assembly refused to let students speak out about their beliefs. Instead, most students I've talked to have no idea what's going on in the student government.

This is what has disappointed me most since coming to Cornell. Very few students care about politics, or feel the urge to protest issues on campus, or know where they stand on major political debates. Only a couple of my friends even voted in elections last year. I'm afraid that our generation will be remembered only for its apathy.
