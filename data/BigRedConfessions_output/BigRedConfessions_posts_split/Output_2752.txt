Dear Random Chinese Girl who decided to sit right across from me in a booth, (not even diagonal from me), instead of any other seats in the dead empty dining hall (Okenshields) during dinner tonight:

WTF. 
Firstly, seriously at least have the decency to ask if anybody was sitting there. I could've been waiting for someone for all you know although in that case my friend had just left. 
Secondly, it's hella creepy, and I feel my personal space is being super violated when you choose to sit so close to me when there are like a bunch of other seats, and entire tables for that matter, open. Please don't make me feel like I've been set up for a surprise blind date I'm not even remotely interested in. 
Thirdly, literally, WTF. Girl, get your shit together and start reading social codes. (Like I did, unfortunately, by not being rude and telling you to gtfo.) Like seriously, I understand if it's crowded but noooo one was there. Did you want company or something? If you were trying to hit on me you were doing a really shitty job btw. 

Please be sure to sit in clearly unoccupied areas next time in a dead empty freaking dining hall please. Don't do what you wouldn't do in a restaurant. Please. 

Sincerely, The really annoyed chick, who was trying to eat her food in peace before you came along
