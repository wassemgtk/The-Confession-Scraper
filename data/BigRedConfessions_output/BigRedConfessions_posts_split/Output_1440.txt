A few days ago I took one of the most important prelims of my life. It would decide whether I would pass the class or get an A. Whether I would end up living in the subway as a hobo who plays plastic bucket drums for an income (which is my plan B) or win a Nobel Prize. In other words, this was the prelim. 

On exam day I opened the question booklet and my jaw dropped. None of the problems seemed solvable. But failure was not an option. I began writing. My efforts seemed futile at first, but I slowly progressed towards an answer. Things started going well midway, my confidence was recovering and time was on my side -or so I thought. Out of nowhere my right nostril starts spewing blood. It was the dreaded nosebleed. Impeccable timing. 

Fuck it I thought. If I went to the bathroom to get tissues and wait for the bleeding to stop, I'd be down 15, maybe even 20 minutes. I tore the first page of the exam paper, which only had directions, crushed it up, and plugged it into the nostril. It was good enough. My peers stared at me with disgust. They wanted me to fail. But they didn't understand the stakes.  

Not too long after I faced yet another obstacle. My mechanical pencil had run out of ammo. There was no mercy. I was being attacked from all fronts. What to do? A minute had already been wasted. I unplugged my nostril. Good, it was still bleeding. I spread the blood on my finger and used it to continue writing. That's right. I used my fucking blood to write my answer. That's how motivated I was. 

Running on only fumes I completed the exam just seconds before the deadline. I stumbled to the front of the room, exhausted but victorious, and gave the exam in, signaling the end of battle.
