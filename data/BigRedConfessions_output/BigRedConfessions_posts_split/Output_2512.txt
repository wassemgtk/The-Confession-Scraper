Sick and tired of all these black people tears on this page. If blacks didn't commit the vast majority of crimes in this country, our prisons wouldn't be overflowing with them. If they stopped crying wolf all the time, maybe they'd realize that someone white or of any other race has the same opportunities they do. If a white kid and a black kid both "start from the bottom," they can both gets jobs at the same places and work their way up. What blacks need is a change in culture, instead of setting the example that being a "thug" and all that entails is cool...

Perhaps this wouldn't be happening if blacks stopped continuing to reinforce the stereotypes that undeniably encompass a majority of their population.
