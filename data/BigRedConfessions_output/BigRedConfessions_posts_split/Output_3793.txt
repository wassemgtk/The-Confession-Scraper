Everyday my parents are pressuring me to find the one and get married so I can be "taken care of". I hate this so much, I'm not that cute and I'm not really even interested in relationships. This a whole world of pressure I seriously don't want or need right now. But I have to do what they say because they own my entire life. So sorry fellas I'm now forced to come after you with my stilettos as my time at cornell is running out.
