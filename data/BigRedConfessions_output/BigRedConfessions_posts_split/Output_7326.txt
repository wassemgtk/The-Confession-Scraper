"I feel awful about being unemployed, and about not having any jobs or internships lined up for the summer. I've applied for low-end campus jobs each semester, but I've always been either turned down or simply ignored. And I know it's entirely my fault. I don't even have a resume, because I have no meaningful experiences to mention or skills to quantify. 

It feels like a Catch-22: each job requires experience, but those ""experiences"" themselves require prior experiences. I need to start somewhere, but the combination of my own self-defeating attitude and employers' utter lack of interest in me has left me in a rut. And I don't fault employers for ignoring me. My work ethic and my drive to succeed have only gotten worse and worse over the course of college. I'm falling behind in coursework, I'm dropping courses, I'm quitting activities, I'm falling out of touch with everyone, and I keep on pushing everything further and further back until it just never gets done.

I've stopped bringing this up with my people, because the reaction is always ""just be thankful you don't NEED to work."" I already feel guilty enough for being so lazy and unaccomplished - the last thing I need is to be guilted for something beyond my control (socioeconomic privilege)."
