One of the main reasons I did a lot of work in your major building towards the beginning of the semester is because I saw you last semester, thought you were cute, and thought this would be the best way to run into you. It's not stalking, it's...nudging fate in the direction I want it to go. But ugh! it didn't work, and now I'm in half a mind to just forget about it.
