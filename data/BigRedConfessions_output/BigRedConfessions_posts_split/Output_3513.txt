I used to only jokingly claim that missed opportunities are the stuff of life.  Now I feel like I've had a little too much life.  It's only a week into the semester and I'm having trouble finding reason to get up in the morning.  Shit, I mean...damn the words are hard to find. This isn't some goddamn novel where a happy ending drops out of the sky.  Every story ends in silence. And solitude.  Shit I'm so alone.
