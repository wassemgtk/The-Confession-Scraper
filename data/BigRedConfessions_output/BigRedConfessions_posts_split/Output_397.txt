"It doesn't matter how nice you are, how much of a good person you are, or how a much of a good friend you are, people will stop being friends with you just because of your political position.

Personally I believe that people who do this are so immature, and I can't believe there are people with such a close mind like this coming to Cornell.

PS, it is ok that you hate me just because I don't conform to your ideals and political views, good look dealing with the real world with that type of mentality tho."
