To combat all the depressing posts about Cornell, I just wanted to say how incredibly grateful I am for the professors that teach my classes. For the first time in my life, I have felt so emotionally invested in a lecture that I was nearly moved to tears (for all good reasons!). I can confidently say that a single professor has made me feel intellectually curious and eternally grateful for my place in this institution. Sure, classes can be extremely hard and confidence-busting, and I tend to have breakdowns when I realize how much I need to do in my years here, but I know that all the learning that I will be doing is forever worth it.  To all the newbies reading not so happy confessions--Cornell can help you cultivate your intellectual self as long as you are open to receive all it has to offer.
