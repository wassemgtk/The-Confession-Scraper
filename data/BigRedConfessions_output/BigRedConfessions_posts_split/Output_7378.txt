I feel like I just don't belong in the LGBT community here at Cornell. Most of my friends are straight and I feel like I fit in better with the straight people I know here much better than the LGBT people, with only a few exceptions. I don't dislike the LGBT people I know and some are quite nice, but I feel a disconnect. This wouldn't bother me except I'm beginning to legitimately feel like I'm going to be single my entire college experience, which is disheartening considering this isn't the case for other people and I manage to attract the opposite sex without really trying.
