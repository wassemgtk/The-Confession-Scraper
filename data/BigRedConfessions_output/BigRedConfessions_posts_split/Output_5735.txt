Whenever you joke about the two of us being like a married couple, I can't help but wonder if you are serious about marrying me. If you are, then I apologize for showing that I've been feeling the same way by pretending to be somewhat freaked out or by trying to change the subject. haha.  Seriously, though, we really need to stop beating around the bush and have a serious discussion about this in the near future.
