Home is in his arms. Home is wherever he holds me close. Sun, rain, or snow. Day or night. Just the two of us looking over the slope or walking through a bustling crowd. Home is arm in arm, by his side. Home is skin on skin, mind in mind, hand in hand, lips on lips. Home is where his heart is, and where his heart is I'll follow.
