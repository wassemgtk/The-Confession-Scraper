I have no friends. There is literally only one person I feel like i know well enough to text to meet up/grab dinner (and I'm always doing the asking). I'm friendly and have a ton of acquaintances but no friends. I pretend I am always swamped with work so my roommate thinks I'm less of a loser. This is making me hate it here. I thought Cornell and my freshman year would be different.
