It's extremely frustrating and depressing just how bad I am at telling the difference between a girl who's friendly to me and a girl who actually likes me. To make myself feel better I usually assume the former and prevent myself from getting bogged down with unnecessary thoughts but damn if it makes me feel stupid.
