"I used to care what people thought, but now I care more
I mean, nobody out here's got it figured out
So therefore, I've lost all hope of a happy ending
Depending, on whether or not its worth it
So insecure, no one's perfect

But she is, she knows who she is
Remember that time we watched les mis?

Be my valentine
