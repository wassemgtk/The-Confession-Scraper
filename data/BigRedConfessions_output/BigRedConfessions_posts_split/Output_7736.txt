The only girl on campus that I've developed a relationship with is Mary Jane, she takes me to Cloud 9. Thing is she drains my wallet like you wouldn't believe; and I'm not sure if you're using me for my money or if you feel the same way about me too. But you've got to give me space so I can study a bit more.
