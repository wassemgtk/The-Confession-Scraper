I was going through an extremely difficult time during my first year here, and I feel like some of the people in my dorm just judged me and thought I was weird and had issues. This wouldn't irk me so much if these same people didn't act like they're concerned, liberal, open minded global citizens in their daily lives and not the judgmental jerks who were unfriendly and condescending toward someone who was visibly struggling. Yes, someone's depression or anxiety might be offputting for some, but I don't think it's ever killed someone to just be nice to people. I might have been deeply upset by hurt I felt at the time, but now that I've overcome the problems I was facing back then I just view these people as hypocritical pieces of ****. That is all.
