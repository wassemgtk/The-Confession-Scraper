I fell for you, against my will, just before you graduated and moved to another state.  And it's all wrong because I'm with someone else.  I told him and it killed him.  A piece of me left with you, and I don't have the strength to try to go and get it back, when my natural impulse is to just let you keep it.  Keep it as a souvenir, under your rug, where even you don't know it's there.  Even you don't know you have that piece of me.  You and I will never speak again.
