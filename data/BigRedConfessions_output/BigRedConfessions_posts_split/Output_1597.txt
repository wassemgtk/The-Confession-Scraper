Within a few days, I left my first job, my girlfriend broke up with me, and almost lost a close family member. It has been a rocky couple of weeks since it happened. 

I felt like a failure for having so much come crashing down onto me. After some days of thinking about it all, I saw how it was not all bad news. I can pick everything up and go forward having learned a lot. 

I am reconsidering what careers would better fit my values before getting a new job and then heading to grad school. My now ex-girlfriend and I had been planning to get married one day and we still love each other now. If we both work towards it, we can still be together. As for my family, I will do all I can for them.
