Theres this beautiful girl I saw in Dickson about a month ago carrying a goldfish. I've seen her around since then and I kept trying to find her room, but I saw her moving out the other day. Mystery girl with the beautiful eyes please tell me you're living on west next year so I can find you and tell you how I feel
