I've always had fantasies involving me cheating on my girlfriend or vice versa, and they're some of my most intense and pleasurable fantasies. Problem is, I'm actually completely faithful and would never betray my girlfriend's trust for another woman, but if I suggest roleplaying that with her it might give the wrong impression and cause some undue distrust and worrying on her part. What to do, what to do...
