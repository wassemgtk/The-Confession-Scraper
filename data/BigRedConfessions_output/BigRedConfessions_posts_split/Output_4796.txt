I was diagnosed with leukemia in April and have been in chemo every week since. I have only told a few people, and it now looks like I'll need to take leave from Cornell this year, missing my senior year. 

I'm very afraid and upset. I've bottled up my emotions and tried to avoid thinking about the high likelihood that this is it for me, and now I'm realizing that I'm probably going to leave this world as a skinny, pale, bald little boy. I won't be able to graduate college or even use my education in the world. My parents, who consigned my loans, will be on the hook for all of my debt.

This is just so fucked up. I keep thinking that this can't be real, like it's a movie or something. I don't know why I'm confessing this here, it's kind of a lame attempt to get strangers to care about me for a few seconds.
