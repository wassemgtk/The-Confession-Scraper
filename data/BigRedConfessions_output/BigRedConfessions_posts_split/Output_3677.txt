I'm a virgin man and in an ideal world I would like to have my first experience with my wife. I don't judge others for have lots of sex with many people and don't think of them as "bad" people. But having been the product of a very bad marriage that fell apart due to infidelity, I'm deathly scared that I will have a wife or long-term lover who is more sexually experienced than me. What happens if we have sex and she just keeps thinking about the other guys? Or what if I just don't measure up to her previous lovers and she leaves me? I'm scared to death. I guess you can say I'm scared I'll end up like one of those poor beta males who a girl marries only because she's ready to slow down and be in a stable relationship with a salaried man after spending the best years having lots of sex with a series of alpha males.
