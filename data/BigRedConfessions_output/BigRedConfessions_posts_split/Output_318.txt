I am glad to have older parents who grew up in the 50's and early 60's. As a Black middle class student from Detroit, it's tough for me to go to school at Cornell and have conservative views, because I know many people that I associate with would lose respect for me and I would most likely lose the friends I have here. It's a shame that people cannot respect one another's differing views here and that I have to pretend I follow liberal views in my classes to pass the course. It seems almost like a paradox that opposing views cannot be tolerated in college, but it's quite evident here at Cornell. I wish more students were open minded here and I'm sure others have had the same issue as I have, especially those who have conservative beliefs. Many students have to hide their beliefs here unfortunately. I just want to let people know that not all Blacks think the same. We are not all liberals and that diversity is very diverse.
