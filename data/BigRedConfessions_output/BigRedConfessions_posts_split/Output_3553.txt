I have been having a rough junior yr.. Last semester, i started off with the notion of dropping out all bc of someone. This someone was so, so important to me to the point that i would cry myself to sleep. We havent spoken since last summer ended yet he is the only person i wake up thinking about and go to sleep. I have been wanting to text you for the longest yet, the notion that the phone works both ways hinders me. I always remind myself of that. This semester is now the battle against myself. I am no longer battling with feelings or emotions about someone, but, i find myself constantly battling against myself. I keep thinking that am not an efficient student and not even smart enough. I study SO SO much to get the grade that someone else just studies for like a day. 
Hard yr. REALLY hard.
