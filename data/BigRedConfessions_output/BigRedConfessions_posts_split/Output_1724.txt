I'm a TA for a class. When I go to our staff sessions on Tuesdays, I feel like most of the people there hate me. They never really respond to my questions or jokes and only the nicest among them try to hold a conversation. Actually, most of the people in my department hate me. I get along with all the kids who are younger than me, though.
