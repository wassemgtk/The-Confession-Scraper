Dear Friend, you always ask about my childhood and think I don’t consider you a close friend because i don’t want to talk about it. It’s not that I don’t think your a close friend, it’s that I when I have a single memory from my childhood my entire stomach ties into a knot and my mind is thrusted into this dark pit that I can’t find my way out of for weeks. So no. I don’t want to talk about it. I don’t need to talk about it. For the sake of my sanity, fuck off.
