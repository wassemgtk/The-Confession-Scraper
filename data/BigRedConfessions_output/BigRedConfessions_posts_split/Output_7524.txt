During my entire time here, all I've been is unhappy, depressed, and academically pressured. All throughout high school I thought college would be the absolute best time of my life. Booming social life, wonderful lifelong friends that you completely understood and absolutely loved and cherished, and an academic environment that is challenging but fun because I would have the freedom to take the classes that I wanted and had genuine interests in. So far, I've found no real friends and just have been completely overwhelmed in classes I have no interest in at all but am only taking to fulfill a requirement. On top of that, having been born and raised in Florida, the horrible weather isn't making my time here any better. Coming here has been a serious disappointment. It truly makes me wonder why I sacrificed so much of my youth and high school career chasing a facade. Every single all-nighter that I pulled in high school, I pushed through and persevered because I kept reminding myself that doing this would let me go to a wonderful university and have the time of my life. Everytime I was bullied in school because I was the "nerdy Black kid", I told myself to wipe my tears, stand up, and think of the great university I would be at while all the other kids would be working at McDonald's. While walking through the ghetto that I called home, I motivated myself to not dwell on my current living quarters and imagine how great college would be and how wonderful my future after college will be when I'm successful.  Every cup of coffee that I drank to keep myself from falling asleep on my homework during the early hours of the morning, reminded me of what a wonderful time I would have in college. My experiences here so far make me really question so much more of my life. The wonderful future I have planned for myself, the wonderful life I've imagined for myself, will it be as disappointing as college has been? Am I just chasing an idea, a dream that truly is just a figment of my imagination? All these questions are driving me absolutely insane.
