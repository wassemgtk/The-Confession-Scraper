I was afraid to ask someone to take a photo of us the other night because I was afraid to capture that moment.  I know that a photo is just a photo, but to me it would have represented a moment in time that I could never get back.  I was too afraid that if I captured that moment, that photo would be a living reminder a few days later that you didn't call, that what we would end up doing later in the night would mean absolutely nothing to you, and that any time in the future could never be as possibly perfect as spending those few hours with you were then.
