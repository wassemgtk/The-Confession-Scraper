To the people on Overheard at Cornell who think it's funny to look over not picking up after yourself, posting pointless (and pretty tacky) memes to detract from conversations that are important to the people who actually have to work these jobs and clean up after your nasty behinds: you are assholes. Crying so much about having your precious feelings hurt (basically you feel offended because someone is rightfully offended by you...wat), while the messes that you claim to be so "small" at Libe accumulate to a disgusting degree. What might seem trivial to you, accumulates over time. I'd love to see you all be the ones to pick up the mess, back and forth, all day. 

I guess empathy isn't something that was fed to you through your silver spoons. 

Also, learn how to use satire properly. Satire can't be used if you're trying to be an asshole. It's used if you want to change a structural problem that's held in place by ignorance (so joke's on you). 

"...in which vices, follies, abuses, and shortcomings are held up to ridicule, ideally with the intent of shaming individuals, corporations, government or society itself, into improvement."
 
Grab a napkin. It's not that hard.
