I tried really hard to keep it a secret between us, but I got so mad at you that I've been secretly telling people what you've done to me. It seems like it's a general consensus that you've fucked up in every way possible and that you're a fucking psycho. It's pretty satisfactory to see you keep pretending to be normal, while they all know how insecure and obnoxious you are.
