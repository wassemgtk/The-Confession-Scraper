I don't know what you need.  You don't know what I need.  I can help you as much as I can, but there comes a time when you need to help yourself, too.  No one can do this alone.  It's okay to ask help of others, like your friends, or a therapist.  But you can't just depend on yourself and your family.  We will always be there for you, but we are not the sole answer to your problems.  

At least I think we're not.  Does this sound alright?
