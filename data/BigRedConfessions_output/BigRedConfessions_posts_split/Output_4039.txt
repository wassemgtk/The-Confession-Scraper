"I listen to everyone's problems. They have no problems coming to me and letting out whatever is bothering them, and I always take that time for them, no matter how much work I have to do. 
But lately, so many things have been happening. 
Today I overheard a friend of mine complaining about how I take up so much of her time (she didn't know I had just entered the lounge). 
A few days ago I was in a situation that brought up my only real phobia, and it took me calling a friend in CALIFORNIA and hyperventilating to them for my housemate to finally come down and help me. 
I hardly ever see my roommate anymore because she says I always distract or bother her.
But I've listened to each of these people's problems. I've never resented that, or made them feel like I had better things to do than help them. 
Lately I've been so stressed and homesick, but who will listen to my problems? Who even takes the time to notice, or ask, or care?
I'm really sorry; this is the first time I've posted something on this; I'm just a bit overwhelmed with everything right now. "
