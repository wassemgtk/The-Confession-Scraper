Sometime i feel my life is like a Deja Vuu. I have had experiences which have been extremely similar on a few occasions and all of them have to be with respect to relationships. Every time i get told by the person that i think too much. Somehow every time i beg to differ. I see change and i do not know how to react to it. Sometimes u arrive in a persons life when they are in between things. They need u but when the real thing comes along they leave u stranded. I have experienced this far too often in my life. At times i feel there is something really wrong with me, then at times i am sure that whatever changes i see are so real and that i am not making these up. Whatever it is,  its a unhealthy and a uneasy feeling. I should stop caring about every person i meet and may be just learn to be like everyone else without caring about anyone but myself. I feel  disheartened, eventually i always end up blaming myself and hurting and punishing myself for every little thing. Please make this stop. It hurts beyond belief :(
