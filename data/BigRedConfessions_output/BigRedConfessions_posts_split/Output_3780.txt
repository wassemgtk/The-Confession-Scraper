I've been through hell. During my sophomore + junior year I lived in several foster homes and went to countless hours of family and personal therapy after dyfs became involved because of my abusive parents. There is a point where the pain of depression becomes so chronic that it manifests itself into physical pain...like someone is holding your heart and squeezing as your lungs are gasping for breath. But I'm past that now, with a fighting spirit stronger than most. My gpa is terrible but I know deep in my heart I'm an exceptional student and person. I just need someone to believe in me. As decision day gets closer and closer, I remember the TA who went out of his way to give me a tour of the school...the red haired girl who recommended I try the dairy bar...the professor whose class was delightfully engaging...and the stranger who gave me directions because he could see I was clearly lost even walking with a map in front of me. I still have that map. I keep it in my pocket everyday to remind myself of my dreams. Thank you Cornellians, particularly hotelies, for making my visit a once in a lifetime experience- regardless if I get accepted or not. I just hope hotel admissions reads my application rather than trash it after one lookat my gpa. If I get in, you can expect great thing from me, I promise. I just need a chance....
