I am depressed. People wouldn't know it from looking at me because i plaster a smile on my face but something has come over me this semester. I'm worried about myself because I keep crying all the time even when I'm in the library trying to do work or in class I have to wipe away my tears and pinch my leg so I don't just start having a crying jag. The worst part is I'm hiding it from my boyfriend and I feel like I am lying to him. I feel like if he knew how I've been lately he would think I'm pathetic because he is  more strongminded then me. I'm also worried I'm going to lose him which makes me even sadder. I just want winter break to come. I called caps and they can only get me in at the end of the month because I presented myself as low risk even though I feel like I'm dying inside and can't stop crying
