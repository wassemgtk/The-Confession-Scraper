I thought I loved you when we were together but now that we're apart it's hard for me to remember what I feel since you put no effort into our relationship. Do I hold on until we're together again? If you don't care about me anymore just say so rather then lead me on the whole summer. I'm over here caring and you're over there not giving a shit. Life's too short,man and this is just stressing me out. You can't do long distance without effort, you just can't. Both people have to commit.
