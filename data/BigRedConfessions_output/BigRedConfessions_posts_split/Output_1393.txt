As a junior, I'm at an awkward point in my life where I am questioning whether or not the major that I chose is right for me. 

Every class related to my major has always been my worst class.  It still frustrates me to see myself struggle in classes that will be beneficial for my career.  And now today,  person that I admired and helped me decide my major is now questioning whether I'm the right fit for this type of work.  That just broke my heart.  If I can't be good at what I like to do, what else is there for me to do.
