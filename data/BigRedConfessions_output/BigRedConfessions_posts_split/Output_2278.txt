I want what we had without the stress and anxiety. I think that after I graduate and leave the Cornell bubble that I could find someone who is better for my mental health, because I don't know any girls here (or really anybody) who aren't constantly stressed, unless they're high or drunk or whatever. But I don't know that there is someone better, and I don't want to throw what we have away if we both can just get over the stress. Maybe that's why so many Cornell couples marry - they've already dealt with the stress of dating at Cornell, and it prepares them well for the unexpected struggles you have to anticipate with marriage.
