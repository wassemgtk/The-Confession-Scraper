I just broke up with my boyfriend. My best (and really only) friend in Ithaca has been crushing on me all semester. I just told him we could give it a go. He's cuteish and everything I would want in the abstract. But we kissed and I have 0 feelings for him. Actually... the thought of having sex with him makes me cringe. I think the problem is that his mannerisms are so feminine, I can't see him as a man. What do I do? I don't want to lose him as a friend.
