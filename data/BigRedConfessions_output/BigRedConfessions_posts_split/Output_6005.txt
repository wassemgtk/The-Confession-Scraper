"Somebody was shocked that so many people liked the comment about Cornell being an unhappy place. I'm shocked that you're shocked. I knew some happy people freshmen year but by this point, everybody I know is just waiting to graduate and get away from this miserable place.

True story: shitty weather, not seeing the sun for most of the year, stressful classes, and a worthless careless administration does not a happy student body make."
