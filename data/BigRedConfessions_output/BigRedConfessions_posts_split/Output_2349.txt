I don't appreciate the radical attachment to Israel expressed by much of the Jewish community on campus. I asked a simply question today: "Since there is an Israel Day, shouldn't there be a Palestine Day as well?," and I was immediately called a terrorist sympathizer.

Please consider the fact that many people disagree with Israel's policies, especially outside of the United States, and that criticizing Israel does not make someone antisemitic.
