Having been raised and homeschooled in an insular, but very liberal household, I've grown accustomed to a lot of things that the average American kid isn't used to. Coming to Cornell has made me realized how grateful I am for the way I was raised. But it's also been difficult to transition from an open and free paradise to the standards of a dull and restricted society. A few examples: My house is in a nudist colony. That means everyone's required to enter naked. My parents always had sex with the doors open. Either my brother or I could walk in any time and observe (We didn't though because that would be pretty weird). My parents, brother and I would all smoke pot together during the Holidays. They let me get my first tramp stamp when I was 9. I lost my virginity when I was 10. I got a dick piercing at the age of 11. I first got hammered with my mom when I was 14. I participated in my first orgy when I was 15. Having had a productive, yet pleasurable lifestyle up to this point, I find college campuses pretty boring. The most interesting thing that happens up here are those frat parties. But even they get repetitive. Sigh...I miss home.
