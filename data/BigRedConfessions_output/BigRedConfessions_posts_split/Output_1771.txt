I wish I could just not work and still make money. I know what you're thinking -- but on't you want to do something with your life? You'd be content with just sitting around all your life? Yes, I would. I totally would. I could sit in a room alone for the rest of my life and I'd be perfectly content. My laziness far outweighs my sense of fulfillment.
