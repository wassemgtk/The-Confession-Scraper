My girlfriend defines hypocrisy. After a 2 years of dating, she finds it okay to spend 70% of the day with a guy who's crazy about her and makes no attempt to hide it. Its annoying that she has every meal of the weak with him, and I'm invited (mostly as an obligation) and treated like a third-wheel. Me, I'm not allowed to text another girl without being called a dick and being ignored for a week. I get the whole being even thing doesn't apply to a relationship, but I'm pretty sure one-way bitchiness calls for some kinda revenge right?
