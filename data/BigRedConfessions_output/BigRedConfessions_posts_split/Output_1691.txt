I love Cornell and I've loved all the people I've met here thus far these last couple years. However, one thing I'll never understand is how lightly people take sex here. It's to the point where being a virgin is seen as a "bad thing that they want to get over with..." 

To play devil's advocate, I've heard people raise the argument, "I have to find my sexual compatibility..." While I understand the concern, this notion isn't only an attempt to justify sleeping around, but also has been proven incorrect by many psychologists, marriage and family experts, and therapists. Other such studies, including a few here at Cornell, have shown that sex early on in relationships (including hookups) leads to sexual dissatisfaction later in life. Sex is the action that created me, and you who is reading this post. Sex is as intimate as you can get with someone and the cultural notion that it can be "casual" is alarming to me for the future of our society. Gone are the days of dating and getting to know people for who they are at heart. Instead, culturally we have an unsaid "sport" of analyzing how a variety of people perform in bed, encouraged by alcohol and other decision-impairing drugs. 

I know people are going to dismiss this post deeming it as "puritanical" and "outdated" but this is the only place where my opinion can be heard. What I'm saying isn't anything religiously affiliated or targeting a specific gender, race, and/or age group. I'm not a "sex police" who goes out of my way to judge and condemn others for their choices, but I consistently face opposition for MY personal choice. 

I know that despite being in a minority, I'm not the only person who feels this way and unfortunately those who have opinions opposing mine, are not very open to how I feel.
