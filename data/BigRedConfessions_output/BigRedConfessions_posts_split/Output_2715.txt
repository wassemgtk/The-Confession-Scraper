For me, a relationship must be based first and foremost on strong friendship. I have witnessed enough successful relationships in my family to know that the foundation for all of them is mutual respect and friendship and not sexual attraction. I worry about finding a boyfriend at college because of the hookup culture and the party culture prevalent here... I hope I can someday find a guy who understands me the way my best friend does.
