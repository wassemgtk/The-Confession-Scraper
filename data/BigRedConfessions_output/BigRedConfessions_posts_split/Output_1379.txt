In response to all these pro-conservative confessions, here's why so many people here are against Republicans.

When I talk politics with people, many of them accuse me of being anti-conservative or anti-Republican. They would be correct on many different counts. I disagree with Republicans on social issues, economic issues, global issues, etc. But that doesn't mean I am anti-conservative. 

There are some things I think the Republicans have right. I do think we need more tax breaks, but they should be affecting the middle class, not the rich. I do think we need to cut spending, but on the military budget, not on social programs. I do think we don't need to regulate Wall Street as much, but ensure that they do not manipulate the market.

When I'm accused of being anti-conservative, I correct the accuser and say that I'm not anti-conservative, but anti-bigotry, or pro-equality. The Republicans today are more conservative than they've ever been. By one popular index, they're more than double as conservative now as they were during the Reagan administration. This leads them to be against many things. Gay marriage, fair gender pay, women's rights, etc. Their name is now tied to anti-equality. And this is what I stand against, and this is why I am so passionately against a Republican Congress and White House. 

Because the Republican party has become the party of bigots and extremists. Because they stand in the way of progress. Because they would rather shut their eyes, cover their eyes, and scream "LALALALALA" than admit that we still have problems that need solutions. That's why we're "anti-conservative."
