Whoever chose the doors for Willard Straight should be thrown off the clock tower. THE OTHER DOORS WERE PERFECTLY FINE AND WENT BOTH WAYS AND NOW I HAVE TO PULL. I do not have time for this nonsense and looking completely ridiculous trying to push that door open. Also, why are the doors in from the parking lot ONLY electric and super heavy? It's such a waste that every single time anyone opens those doors the motor engages and they open super slowly.
