i've never had a serious bf before. sure, i've had guys be into me and sometimes i've even been into them too, but it never gets any further than a date or so, or nothing super emotionally-invested. i'm not even sure if it really bothers me. i don't think i FEEL lonely, despite what my friends suggest. sometimes, i'm more worried by the fact that i'm NOT all that bothered... is that normal?
