My girlfriend has serious communication issues.  She'll let things build up and won't say anything to me until everything explodes.  I'll know when these moments are about to happen because she'll reply to my texts with words like "Yes" and "k" (She usually uses "yeah" instead of "yes", and no person in a good mood responds to anything with "k").  If she responds to multiple texts in a row with single words, that's how I know shit's about to go down.  But no matter what I do, no matter how much I try and convince her that she should talk to me about the issues that lead to these fights so that we can work through it constructively rather than get pissed at each other, she always tells me that I'm blaming her for everything.  

I can do no right.  It doesn't help at all that we're in a long-distance relationship.  I don't know what to do.  Sometimes I feel like I'm dating a toddler.
