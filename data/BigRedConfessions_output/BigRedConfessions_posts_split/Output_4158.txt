"There are a few things that I'm scared of:
      1. Huge --I mean HUGE--tidal waves on the order of like 500 ft. carrying me through the vast expanse of the ocean.
              a) Above wave crashing into the East Coast and me being caught in it
      2. Girls. If I'm talking to girls I find attractive both physically and personality-wise in an academic or professional setting I usually don't have a problem. But when it comes to casual talk or striking up a conversation to potentially flirt and see where the arrow hits, I break out into a sweat and for some reason my body and scalp get really itchy (not joking).
      3. Going bald before I find a woman I could settle down with.
      4. Never living up to my momma's expectations and not being able to save her from our dire social and financial situation.
     5. Finding out I have a small penis when the girl looks at me and says: ""That's it?"" . I've never bothered to check the average statistics online. So far, I've just been fooling myself into thinking I'm average lol. 
      6. Going back to being homeless and staying homeless.
      7. Finding out the world is fake and just one huge dream.
      8. Elliptical machines. When I get off of them, I feel like my feet are still moving and it makes me freak the fuck out.
      9. Death.
     10. Life.
     11. Dying alone.
