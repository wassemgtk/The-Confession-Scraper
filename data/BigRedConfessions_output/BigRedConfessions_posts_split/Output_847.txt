I hate how cold and reserved "hook up culture" has made people. If I like someone, I shouldn't have to feel like we have to have sex to keep them interested. If I was the last person to answer, I shouldn't have to worry about looking desperate for double texting because I like talking to you. If I see you in public, I shouldn't have to worry about whether or not it's cool to acknowledge each other without having to explain to either of our friends that "we just hookup". I guess I just wish that there was more passion and less inhibitions but it seem like a college campus isn't the place for that.
