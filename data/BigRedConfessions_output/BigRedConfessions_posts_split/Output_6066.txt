"Dear everyone :)

At times I feel the way u people treat me is so unfair. U know when I sit here I begin to think that u guys are just selfish. Later I realize that actually I am the stupid one :). You guys don't even do anything, it's just that I get emotional about every person. Believe me it's a disease. To sit here and care just about everyone is crazy. At times u guys just need someone to fill spaces, so when I come around and see that u are sad and do insane things to make u all happy, u guys don't complain and I just about do everything to make u guys happy. I let go of my ego, self respect and just about everything. Then after a few days when all is ok, u all treat me like the stranger I was. Dear everyone I know no one asked me to do all this. No one asked me to be emotional. I know it's totally my fault that I have no hold on myself. May be I am weak and may be I am stupid. If wish u would all stop doing this. Slowly but surely all of u r killing what's human in me. Eventually I'll lose this feeling and may be then I would have learnt my lessons. Keep up your good work :)"
