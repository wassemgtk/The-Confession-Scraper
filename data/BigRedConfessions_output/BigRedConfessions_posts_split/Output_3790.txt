"Guys, switch majors if you have to. Don't be trapped by dogma, which is the result of living with other people's thinking. Work will be a big part of your life. The only way you can feel fulfilled is by doing great work, and in order to do great work, you must love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking, and never settle.
I'm graduating right now and the only reason I am is I recognized the signs and got out of my old major when I needed to. Every semester since I've been making Dean's List, my parents are proud of me, and I've gotten the college experience I've wanted.
It takes courage to act. It takes courage to start over again."
