To confession #5557:
There's no such thing as a "wrong" message. Every decision in its on way is the right decision. Take a chance, use the moment, and go with your gut.

If you are who I think you are, please know that I feel the same way and I've been missing having you as a close friend. I may also have fucked us up last semester but I sense that the wave between our minds can foster such a rich friendship.

..and you don't have to fear that you're leading me towards something that isn't there.

I already know.
