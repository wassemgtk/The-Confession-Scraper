I'm in a club, and I have a crush on one of the officers, who probably doesn't even know my name. It seems like it would be easy to deal with, but the issue is I'm a guy and he's a guy, and I don't even know if he likes guys. I'm a freshman and too shy to do anything about it. I don't know what is wrong with me...
