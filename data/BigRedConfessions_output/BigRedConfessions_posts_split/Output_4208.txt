"Dear men,

Honestly, I'd probably feel better if you just said straight up we weren't going to see each other again so I could just move on to the next person.
This whole waiting thing sucks balls. I don't want to text more than once because I don't want to look crazy, clingy, or naggy, but waiting is maddening. I don't know if you're busy, if you've forgotten, or if you're just not interested. Save everyone some time and just say it, please.

Sincerely,
Just trying to get my daily dose of the D."
