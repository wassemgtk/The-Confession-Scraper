I despise 9/10 people I meet. Even worse, I end up befriending people I have zero intentions of talking to. It's a continuous cycle of timidity followed by my own guilt. I hate anything and everyone, and I don't care that I smell up your space with nicotine. Hell I can hardly participate in class because I cannot be sober.
