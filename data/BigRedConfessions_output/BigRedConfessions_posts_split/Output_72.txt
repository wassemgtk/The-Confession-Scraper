I am just a conservative nerd who also happens to be a Cornellian and who likes ham radio, electric apparati, mechanical devices, and to study the history of such devices and the 20th century. I have a massive antenna array at my house along with a parabolic antenna and a private substation that provides three phase power to my compound and machine shop. I have a cynical attitude of everything and I don't take people's bullshit. In fact people's bullshit just bounces off of me like a Teflon covered frying pan. I love teaching people how to operate ham radios, fix electronic devices, and about the history of our great country. Any hammies out there?
