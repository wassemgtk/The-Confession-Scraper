If I have any advice for incoming freshmen, its that when you're getting to know people and trying to make friends, don't settle for anyone just because you're scared of being alone. Freshman year is hard, you might battle depression, you might party too hard, and you'll definitely need a shoulder to cry on. Take your time, get to know people, and make sure that the people you choose to be your friends are people you can count on when life gets hard. Don't settle, because when life get tough, those friends will be the ones who stay by your side. No one knows anyone during Orientation, you won't be left behind and sometimes fast friends will leave just as quickly.
