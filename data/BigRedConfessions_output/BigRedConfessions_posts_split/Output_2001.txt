I’ve arrived in Ithaca to start the move-out process following my withdrawal from Cornell and eventual transfer to another college. Needless to say, however, that it has definitely changed me in so many ways. These are some of the top things that I learned:

1. My closest friends are (and will always be) the ones I have from home. Nothing separates us.

2. I might not be the most social person, but I’ve learned to embrace my inner introvert.

3. If you’re smart and go to a school of extremely intelligent people, don’t ever feel average.

4. My dating game is terrible, and I missed so many opportunities. No risk, no reward.

5. Don’t forget that there’s a world outside of college.

6. Don’t forget to be social, at least sometimes. And no, going to class doesn’t count.

7. I thought I was liberal, but being at CU made me see the world differently and changed that. No matter what side you’re on with any big issues, respect the opinions of others. 

8. Not only in the context of #7 but in any context, explore and challenge the ways you think in college.

9. Be careful of who you trust. Friends that only get in touch with you when they need something aren’t friends at all.

10. Health and happiness trump absolutely everything else.

Peace out, Cornell! It’s not you. It’s me. It’s time to move on.
