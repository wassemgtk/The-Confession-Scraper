I cheated and you found out. The biggest regret of my life. Not you finding out but cheating. You were the first love of my life. I inagined spending our whole life together. But I cheated. Because I am dumb. Because I did not think. Because I did not see you were the only girl to ever love/ care for me in my life. I will never find another girl that meant as much to me as you do for the rest of my time at Cornell. I love you and always will continue to love you even though you hate me.
