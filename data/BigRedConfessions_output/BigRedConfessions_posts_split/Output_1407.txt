In regards to all the references to confessions being "trolls". Let me post something "trolly" myself. I feel like "troll" is the most used and incidentally misused term on the internet. Any time anyone says something annoying or defiant or ranty or sarcastic, it's automatically labeled "troll". People certainly modify their opinions when you introduce anonymity, to make them more stringy and ironically in the context of "trolling" -- more honest. Everyone has opinions that they know they cannot express in public because they will be ridiculed (often rightly), so they keep it inside, and they use anonymous internet posting as an outlet. Sometimes they enhance them a little, just to add to their point and stick it to people who think otherwise, like a child does when they don't get their way. It's not some crazy phenomenon, humans have been doing this for thousands of years. It doesn't make the content of it dishonest or invalid. If anything it makes it more honest. And even if some posts are completely fabricated to stir controversy -- what do you care? Can you ever test for that? Can you read minds? Does it matter? Are they opinions people actually hold? Yes. So why do you care? You're the trolls by calling them out, by your definition. You're the ones stirring controversy.

This post was a good example of my point -- I'd never say this in public. I am being a "troll", but the point is legitimate.
