To #3346: My ex was just like that. He could be very sweet and loving when he wanted, but he rarely decided to do it. And I loved him more than anything, but I broke up with him. And it is one of the best decisions I've ever made. You deserve someone who loves you all the time. I don't know if you've heard of her, but there's an author I love - Rainbow Rowell. I read her first book, Attachments, and there was this quote that struck me:

"'I didn't know love could leave the lights on all the time. I thought it took more naps. Or blinked. I didn't know it could just go on and on and like this without falling off an edge. Like pi. Lincoln... Lincoln, are you asleep? I didn't know someone could love me like this,' she said. 'Could love me and love me and love without... needing space.'

Lincoln wasn't asleep. He rolled on top of her. 'There's no air in space.'

You deserve someone who needs you to breathe. Go find them.
