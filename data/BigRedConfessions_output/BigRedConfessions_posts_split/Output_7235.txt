"Dear girl at Okies,
I always notice you when you walk in for lunch because of your adorably distinctive hat. The blue, grey and white fibers call to me, urging me to stroke it softly, rhythmically. I am drawn to you and your hat like a moth to a flame. I love the way you sing and dance along to Happy Dave's music as you walk around because I too am a passionate lover of song and dance. So in the words of the world's greatest musical film, ""You’re one of those acapella girls, I’m one of those acapella boys, and we’re gonna have aca-children. It’s inevitable."" 
PS. I wrote you a poem.

The world without you is an unbearable miasma.
Every time I see you, I get asthma.
You melt my heart into a warm pile of plasma.
I swear I don't have rabies,
Please have my babies.

And for all of you non-English majors,
