I think the guy who posted the "just shut up" post has completely set off a total shit storm here but the dialogue is useful. I'd probably push back on the whole "shut up" side since dialogue is probably more constructive here than just listening; but I agree with the spirit of the argument that we might just listen to each other a bit. We're getting caught up in semantics. We seem to agree that discrimination towards minority groups exists but then we get caught up in the part about discrimination towards whites. This argument is not being properly framed. Let's move past this in a simple way. Let's first happily admit that there is such a thing as "reverse" racism or discrimination or however you want to call it. But now let's ask the drastic question of, yeah, so what? What does reverse discrimination or racism towards white people amount to? People are posting like it's some major thing that has effected so many people we all know. And what happened? Did someone call you a honky? Did they say you couldn't dance or rap or play basketball? Did they make fun of you for using street slang or wearing your baseball cap in a certain way? What is this racism towards white people? Did you get denied a job or a place in a university? Do you really know someone? How can you definitively verify that racism towards white people kept them from these goals? If all these minorities are getting all these jobs instead of white people, why do all these objective statistics suggest that unemployment rates are so much higher for racial groups? If some white guy told another white guy that he totally would've hired him if it hadn't been for racial quotas, do you think this guy didn't have a reason for perhaps lying about this? Isn't it a lot easier to just tell somebody you know or who knows someone you know that they didn't get a job because of something that they can't control rather than because they're not qualified? It seems to be the go to strategy for breaking up with people so it's a pretty common strategy. I'm from a working class background and the next white person I meet who didn't get a job because it was stolen by an immigrant or a black person filling a racial quota would be my first. So let's get those stats on all these white people who are being really tangibly blocked from something of value because of discrimination and then let's stop and think about what it is that any racism towards whites amounts to. Now, let's think about the actual data we have from studies where people who have "black" sounding names won't get called in for interviews. Let's look at the decades of extreme examples of police brutality directed towards people disproportionately because of race. Let's look at the minor things that blow your minor daily annoyances out of the water: the inability to get a taxi; the belief from others that you got your job or got into Cornell because of some racial quota; the distrustful looks directed towards you from store clerks; women clutching their purses as you approach; people constantly treating you like a race even when they're desperately on your side, keeping you from ever just being the same; police stopping you on a far more regular basis, treating you like a common criminal. Think about that next time you're ranting about your prelims or the walk up the slope; or the line at Starbucks; or the rude TCAT driver. I'm not trying to make your problems insignificant, but what I am saying is that white privilege is not some ticket to easy street: it is the ability to live without these daily annoyances. It is the ability to be born - if you are a man in an urban environment - without a 1 in 3 (!) chance of ending up in prison at some point in your life. Life is not easy just because you are white. It is only not made more difficult simply because of something you cannot control - something that is not random or just bad luck. As a last point, saying to white people that they should shut up and just listen and that they can't have an opinion is completely counterproductive. If they can't ever understand (not even a little) then what is the point of even talking about this? If we can't understand other people, we aren't human. We have evolved to be empathetic towards others and this allows us to take on the perspective of others; it allows for compassion. Some of us might utilize this property more than others, but it is there. We can't ever know 100% the feelings or experiences of another, but we can approach the other if we listen; if we discuss; if we relate these experiences to others. We have moved towards acceptance of homosexuals because (!) we all know homosexuals. They are our family members; our coworkers; our friends. We cannot segregate them into urban enclaves and only know them through parodies in the media. If we know more of those who differ -  if we force ourselves to get to know those who we view as an affront to our own beliefs - we will approach understanding in an imperfect sense. If you believe that half the country is stupid because they are conservative or liberal, then sit back and listen; get to know these people. People on both sides are intelligent and good and many of us are on either side because we were raised that way; not because it's right and we're smarter. Come on people.
