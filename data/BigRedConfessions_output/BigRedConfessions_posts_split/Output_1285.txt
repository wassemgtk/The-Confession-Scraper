"Men, we are handicapped when it comes to arguing cause we have a need to make sense‚Äù - C. Rock.

The older I get, the less I understand women (especially many of the girls at Cornell). For ex.whats the point of dressing up in mini skirts or dresses and then complaining about how cold it is in the middle of February when you go out in collegetown? On a related note, if high heels hurt, why wear them in the first place? No point in wearing heels and then saying your feet hurt! If thats the case, don't wear them! And then, there is my work (at an NGO where its 90% women), as a man you cannot make a comment about a women's appearance (as that is sexual harassment) but all I hear every day is "cute shoes" and "thats a cut outfit." ..... 

Also, wtf is with "I need space", is that code for I wanna date other people, i'm evaluating the situation, or i don't know how i feel? 

I'm not trying to be a jerk, I just want a woman to explain to me the female mind.
