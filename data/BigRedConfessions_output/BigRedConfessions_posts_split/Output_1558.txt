I thought Cornell would be a new beginning for me, as a trans guy, to finally come out of the closet and live my life authentically.  Most of those who I am out to, however, continue to misgender me and use my dead name.  It's getting hard to remember who I am and am not out to and I worry I'll slip up one day.
