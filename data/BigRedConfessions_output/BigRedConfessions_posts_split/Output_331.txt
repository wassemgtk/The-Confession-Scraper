I can't remember that last time i talked to somebody, other than saying hey and getting help at office hours. I have no friends. I spend all weekend alone, Ive eaten every single meal alone since winter break. Its even worse now that its warm. I see everyone outside together, laughing, talking, hanging out. I just don't want to be so alone.
