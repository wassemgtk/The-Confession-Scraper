To the idiots who are putting graffiti on campus (excluding the frat house), throwing hammers and sickles on historic statues and buildings is not going to do jack sh*t for your cause, if that is the point. The administration may see it as they spend thousands of YOUR dollars to clean it, but they are not going to listen. If you are protest groups, then protest! If you are stupid teens, take your angst elsewhere. Why are you doing this? Why? But on the subject of the frat house, I am a victim of sexual assault so I can understand that pain. I would have loved to tag my attackers house, after no one listened to me. But I didn't, instead I got up the courage to go to a support group that  helped me get some of my life back. I don't know if graffiti will help them listen to that struggle either.
