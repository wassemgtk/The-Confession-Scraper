I feel like I'm always putting people as a priority in my life when I'm merely an option in theirs. It's so tiring. Why am I always a shoulder to cry on, and when I need somebody, everyone is too busy? Am I that worthless? Do I care too much? It seems like being selfish is the way to be happy in this school :(
