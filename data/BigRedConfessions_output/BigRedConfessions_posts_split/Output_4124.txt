A lot of times I just feel so alone. I'm a new graduate student at Cornell in a very rigorous field. I'm a bit older too (late 20's) because I took time off after undergrad to work and travel. Many of my ""friends"" in my department and people I just meet at parties or bars, who happen to be grad students, have these age insecurities too and talk about how ""old"" they are. They're 22 or 23. I just want to be like: ""shut the fuck up, you're not old!""    

I guess my own insecurity with my age and where I am in life also stems with my life experiences. I've lost my brother and father in the past six years. Three years ago my younger and only sibling accidentally overdosed on a speedball. He was a brilliant, budding scientist but also liked to experiment with hard drugs. Go back six years ago, my dad died from cancer. Now its just me and my mom. I'm like, what the fuck. Who can relate to the loss and pain I've gone through, here at Cornell? 

I'm  a social guy and outgoing, and I've made some good friends here thus far, but I'm not satisfied, I haven't found my group yet. 

And then don't get me started about dating. As a grad student, I feel like its not as easy to meet people as it was in undergrad. So much work all the time. I'm in a research field and am taking three hard classes and have a Research Assistantship that I have to do well in. 

I'm hoping that any day now, things are going to magically fall into place. But I know that to be a falsehood.
