I've thought you were one of my closest if not closest friend I have. I raved to everyone about how fantastic of a person you are and how close we are and how compatible we are. I told my parents that you were my best friend. Yet despite all this, this weekend I've realized that I'm nothing more than a distant friend, possibly an acquaintance to you. The countless times you've invited me to places, to eat, and to spend time with you, it was simply because none of your other friends were available. I'm the last guy you call. I'm sorry I confused the hours we spent together, the life stories we've shared, and the adventures we've gone on as a symbol of friendship and bonding time. I won't annoy you with my existence ever again.
