I loved you. And I knew, I'm not stupid, I put it all together way before we broke up. What really hurt, is that you weren't man enough to tell me. I'm not sad that we broke up, because you never trusted me to begin with. You never talked to me. You lied, even with the "Let's be friends" bullshit. I'll miss holding your hands and laying beside you at night, but I won't miss your piss poor attitude. There's a guy out there for me who can give me everything I loved about you, but without being a dick. Have a great life, I hope you find someone you deserve.
