I was going to post something attempting to add constructive input to the constant bickering about racism n shit, but after typing something out I said fuck it.  I'm just gonna go chill with my Haitian, Domican, Indian, and Arab buddies.  Motherfucking racial rainbow up in here.  

But seriously, just chill out a little bit.  Change won't happen tomorrow, and as long as you believe in accepting others for who they are, and confront your own inner biases, than you are helping us move things in the right direction.  

Equality is subjective.  It means something different to everyone, but I propose that you just believe in love. That you believe in brotherhood and sisterhood.  In supporting your neighbor.  After all we are all on this struggle bus together.  

Peace.
