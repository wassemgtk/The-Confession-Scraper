I think every kind of extremist is annoying. Okay I get you care about your cause but you should be open minded and listen to others as well. Everyone comes from different backgrounds and are raised differently. Just because you hold a view doesn't mean you're right and it doesn't mean you're superior to other people who don't think like you. Disagreement doesn't mean stupidity.
