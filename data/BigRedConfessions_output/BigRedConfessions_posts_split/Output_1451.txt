I have to get this off my chest.  I graduated last year, and I'm finding that the real world and relationships is more complicated than I ever thought.

I think a married man is having an emotional affair with me.  We're part of a campaign group and a lot of us are professionals at different stages in our lives who believe in the cause.  I'm the youngest person in the group.  I work really hard on this project because I've been obsessed with succeeding professionally, and I'm less inclined to spend my time w/ people my own age who maybe don't take care as much about their work.  All of us go out after work events and meet up pretty frequently, both for social and professional matters.  I've made great friends through this project, which is nice because working a shit ton and not having the patience/willingness to get shit faced every weekend at fratty bars makes it less likely that I'd be hanging out with people my own age.  But maybe that's because my college friends were the wrong type of people for me.  I don't know.  It's been a weird year. 

The guy is 10 years older years older than me, has two kids, a great wife, and a lawyer for one of the best law firms in the city.  We've know each other for a year now, and I think he's one of my best friends.  He's a very stand up and busy guy but he's always available to talk to me.  We mostly talk about work and the group, and it's nice.  I've been to his house a couple of times for his kids birthdays, and his wife is amazing and sweet.

Something's changed, though.  A while back, someone that we work with commented that our relationship was weird-- he apparently listens to my opinion more than they thought was appropriate.  I didn't think too much of it, and I joked about it with him over text.  Later that week, we met up for drinks after work, just the two of us.  We've never hung out alone, but I had to vent to him about something.  We drank a lot and we talked a lot. It was easy, and nice, but at the end of it, he brought up that other person's comment, and asked me if I thought it had any merit.  I said no, we're friends.  He said he doesn't have female friends and that he never hangs out with women alone.  I didn't know what to say.  It was weird.

The other day, we went out with the project crew again.  It was great, we all had a great time, but he texted me priviately, asked to hang out w/ me alone after they left.  I agreed. We ended up lying and ditching them and then going to another bar and talking until 4 in the morning.  He told me that lately he's been thinking of me all the time.  I joked that it was because we work on this project all the time and we're in constant contact.  Occasionally he would put his arm around me and I'd put my head on his shoulder.  It wasn't anything that I hadn't done before w/ some of my guy friends, but none of them were ever in a relationship let alone married.  

I feel guilty and weird and confused.  I've been thinking about him all the time too.  I don't know why, it never was a thing until someone pointed out that we were strange.  

I don't even know how to approach this with him.  I'm torn between wanting to see him and talk to him all the time (we called and talked about the campaign a few hours after we left each other) and just quitting everything and walking away from him.  His life is great-- one of my favorite things about him is how much he loves his kids and how great of a husband he is.  I don't want to get in the way of anything, and my gut tells me this is trouble.  I can't talk to anyone about this because I also don't want people to gossip and cause unnecessary drama-- it could cause real harm to his wife, and I never want that.

I don't know what's going to happen.
