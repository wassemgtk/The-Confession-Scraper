Never in my life have I felt this defeated. My motivation and hope dwindle everyday, and now I feel as though nothing can help me. I don't know what to do or who to turn to. I have exhausted all of my resources, because other people have given up on me as well. I feel like a horrible person for feeling horrible, because I know that other people may be struggling and suffering more.
