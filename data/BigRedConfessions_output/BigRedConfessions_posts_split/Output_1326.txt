now change conservative and change it for liberal, it is the exact same argument.

everyone now is so entitled that they think they are right on their political visions, heck even as a minority i cant be openly about being "conservative" because i will get attacked and discriminated by my own peers.

sometimes (not always) some "liberals" can be more wild that your standard conservative.

also, about being more conservative, which i assume you read in an online article i saw floating a couple of weeks ago; the people who came up with that "measurement" are comparing conservatives today with a more liberal benchmark, ie it makes liberals look less liberal than what they currently are, when simply conservatives have not moved much from their beliefs for years.
