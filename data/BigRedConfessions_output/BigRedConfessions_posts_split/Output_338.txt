I am finding it increasingly hard to be friends with people once I know about their political beliefs. I know, I know. I should have friends with different opinions and learn from them. But what can I learn from someone who supports Trump? How to not grammar use? I honestly cannot stand people who support Trump and it doesn't matter if they were ever my friend.
