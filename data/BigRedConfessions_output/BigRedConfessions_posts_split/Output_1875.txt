I'm a senior this year and I have very few friends- many of them have either graduated or drifted from me and are hanging out without me. To make things worse, I'm living with people who I feel barely like me. I don't know how to make myself likeable again among my old friends, or even how to make new friends entirely, since I'll be graduating anyway. I feel tremendous pain and loneliness inside and I have no one to talk to about it, not even my own parents. I sometimes honestly have to take a break from my work, and either write in my journal or cry, and this prevents me from being productive. Wtf is wrong with me? My first two years of college were nothing like this, it's only the past year or so where everything went downhill. I need some serious life advice. I kind of just wish this damn school would let me graduate now so I can leave.
