You are all so goddamn strong, and you don't even know it.

Hang in there.

You made it this far because you have what it takes - you have what it takes to see it through.

Take it from me...a decade from now, you'll look back on the crises which plague your soul today and crack a wry smile. 

You can do this.

I believe in you.
