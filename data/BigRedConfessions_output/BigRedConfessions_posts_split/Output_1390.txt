No one knows ~You~ better than yourself. No one, no matter how much they love ~You~ , will have your true best interests at heart, so make that sure ~You~ are your own best advocate. Learn to say no to things that do not fit with your best vision of ~You~ . Start with the small stuff. It gets easier. Love yourself. Take time away from the noise of others and get to know ~You~. Take a walk around Beebe Lake without your phone. Look up and around and realize that ~You~ are a part of all that is magnificent about this school and area. Be ~You~  and do ~You~!
