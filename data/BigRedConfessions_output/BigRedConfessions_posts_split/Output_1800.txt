At least 90% of my day is thinking about food, counting calories, looking at myself in the mirror, suppressing my hunger and getting angry at myself for being hungry. But you don't notice because as a guy with anorexia, nobody will take me seriously. I just want to be able to eat something without feeling every emotion possible.
