"It’s sad that you choose to treat me with such indifference, despite the fact that I was always there for you when you needed a shoulder to lean on. I know that things got weird between us but that was a while ago, and I’m terribly sorry. I’ve tried to make things better but honestly I’m tired of giving and getting nothing back. Just know that you chose to throw our friendship away. It’s time to move on. 

But I will miss you.
