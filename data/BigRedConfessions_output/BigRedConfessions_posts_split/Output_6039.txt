While it's sad that I'm graduating and leaving soon, it has also been incredibly empowering. This short timeframe has forced me out of my little bubble. I am finally not afraid to reach out and spend time with people I truly care about. Sometimes, it takes a goodbye to teach you how much you love and are loved.
