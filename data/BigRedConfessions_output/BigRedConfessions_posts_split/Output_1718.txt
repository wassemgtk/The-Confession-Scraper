I just want to enjoy little things in my life. I try to be optimistic and enjoy the moment, but the workloads and competition here just discourages me to enjoy anything in my life. I would just to chill and maybe go out for coffee, and maybe I could have fun in many events happening in school. But I am just always fucking tired and depressing that I just shut myself out from the rest of the world. I will just have to suck it up and go study again. I already have given up meeting new people and maybe meet my potential someone. In here, I am just a loser with no money, no intelligence, and no optimism. Days like these just make me wonder whether it is Cornell that makes me feel like this or it is just me.
