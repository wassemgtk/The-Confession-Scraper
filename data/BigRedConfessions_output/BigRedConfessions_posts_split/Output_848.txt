I can't stand people who don't have the  common courtesy to control their volume. I am sitting in Appel trying to cram and there is a kid who was literally YELLING about football for about twenty minutes (at which point i left). I was sitting 50 ft away. multiple people were clearly giving him looks but he didn't notice and/or care. I know its a dining hall, not a library, but it was just absurd. /end rant
