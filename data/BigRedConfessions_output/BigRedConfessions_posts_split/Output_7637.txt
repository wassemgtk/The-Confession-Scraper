"One who is 'in love' is not genuinely interested in fostering the personal growth of the other person. If we have any purpose in mind when we fall in love it is to terminate our own loneliness and perhaps ensure this result through marriage. The in-love experience does not focus on our own growth nor on the growth and development of the other person. Rather, it gives us the sense that we have arrived and we do not need further growth.

Research seems to indicate that there is a third and better alternative. We can recognize the in-love experience for what it was - a temporary emotional high - and now we pursue 'real love.' That kind of love is emotional in nature but not obsessional. It is the love that unites reason and emotion. It involves an act of will and requires discipline, and it recognizes the need for personal growth. Our most basic emotional need is not to fall in love but to be genuinely loved by another, to know a love that grows out of reason and choice, not instinct.

It is the choice to expend energy in an effort to benefit the other person, knowing that if his or her life is enriched by your effort, you too will find a sense of satisfaction - the satisfaction of having genuinely loved another. It does not require the euphoria of the 'in love' experience. In fact, true love cannot begin until the 'in love' experience has run it's course."
