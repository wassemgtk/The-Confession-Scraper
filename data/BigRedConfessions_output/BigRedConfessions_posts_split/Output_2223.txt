You're stunning, beautiful, perhaps one of the most amazing girls I've met in my entire life. I was seriously thinking of starting to really pursue you, but then I saw that guy you've started hanging around with. A lot. If he's your standard, then I'm glad I don't register on the same levels of bravado and "being incredibly full of yourself" that he does.
