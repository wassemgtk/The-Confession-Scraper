Honestly, freshman year was extremely hard for me.  My boyfriend went to college down the road from Cornell, and I was with him most of the time.  I didn't make very many friends because I didn't go to parties and I didn't join a sorority.  It is hard to find friends who didn't join a sorority.  I made a lot of friends, but I never spent any time out of class or work with them.  I rarely ate dinner with anyone.  I also battled with depression because my boyfriend totaled his car and I was the passenger.  It was scary and I didn't have anyone to lean on except for him, but he was depressed as well.  So I had no one to pull me out.  I ended up pulling myself out of it, and now I've lost 20lbs and I'm feeling stronger than ever.  Going into my sophomore year I'm going to be more open and actually look for more friends.  I have never felt more strong or grown up in my life.  Its empowering and it is an absolute great feeling.  So for those having a rough time with your life, find a friend, or rely on yourself.  Everything gets better even if you don't think so at the time.
