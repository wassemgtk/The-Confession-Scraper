As a girl with CBS (chronic bitchface syndrome), I have realized no one willingly goes up to talk to me and it's making me feel pretty lonely. And when I try to talk to people I get rejected/ignored. I've been smiling more (so much so that it hurts) and I'm an extremely friendly person but nothing helps. HALP.
