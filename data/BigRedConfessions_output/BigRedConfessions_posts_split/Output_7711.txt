You changed and I can't tell if it's because you're pledging or because this change was a long time coming. I just wanted to let you know I liked you better before and that you don't have to pretend to be an ass. Last semester, I was with a guy who started out really sweet then turned into a huge ass. Granted, he could have been an ass from the beginning and I was too blind to see it, but I feel like what really happened was that he was trying to conform to the expectations his friends had for him. You could tell he was kind of nerdy in the way he was really passionate about what he studied, not in a socially awkward way. I thought this was really awesome because I'm also really passionate about what I do. Yet, he changed and the guy he changed into didn't really seem to fit him. I know college is the time for metamorphosis, a time to figure out the person you want to be and strive to be that person. I hope that when I graduate I don't leave the same person I was when I walked unto Cornell's campus my freshman year. I hope I grow, learn, make mistakes, and figure out who it is I want to be, all the while working to become that person. But the changes you guys made don't feel organic. I could be wrong, but I just don't feel like you guys are being true to yourselves and I don't understand the need for freshman guys to prove themselves. Own who you are; it makes way for other people to own who they are. If you're the guy who gets passionate about programming and rather be with one girl than do random hookups, be that guy....there's no reason for me to be listening to Avril Lavinge's "Complicated" as often as I do nowadays. It ain't 2005 anymore. Still, I dedicate that song to you.
