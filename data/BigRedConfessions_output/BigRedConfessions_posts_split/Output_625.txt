100 Jobs, that's nothing! I've applied to over 300 and I'm still sitting at home like a leech sucking my parents dry because no one wants to hire me. I'm so desperate, more than you, that I'm considering being a prostitute because I no longer have the dignity to have to live off of someone especially after finishing an Ivy League school like Cornell. My parents never went to college and own a successful business, own a house, and were able to do it in their early 20's. I really suck and I guess sometimes you have to do what you have to do to earn money. I feel so ashamed of myself when my family sees me for the piece of crap that I am. I think Cornell is lousy too because it often seems that everyone here has a job, yet there are many people who do not find a job and never make it into the stats because they never fill out the survey they are sent after graduation because they are sick of the school."
