I feel like i should chime in on the Overhead at Cornell debate thats going on right now:

As someone who was essentially a janitor of a small school over the summer (cleaning the entirety of the school was one of my duties), all of you guys trying to correlate spilled milk with notions of class privilege/class warfare etc are reaching hard as fuuuuck.

A person who spills milk on the counter of a table isn't some inconsiderate asshole who symbolically spits on the working/lower classes, she's just an inconsiderate asshole. In my experience as a janitor, nearly EVERYONE accidentally makes a mess and forgets to/doesn't clean it up at some point, even my coworker who shared my janitorial duties. People who make accidental messes aren't privileged classist assholes, they're just assholes.

If you still disagree with me, then think about this, and I say this from experience-- cafes/restaurants/etc are just as dirty, if not dirtier, as those in Cornell.
