Not ONE of my "friends" made me feel special on my birthday. No quality time, no stopping by to say hello, no tokens of our friendship, no treats, no cards... All I wanted was for them to make some time to celebrate with me. I was patient. I didn't want to get angry or feel sorry for myself. I even convinced myself it didn't bother me. But the truth is, I'm getting really, really tired of loving people and being taken for granted. I want to feel special once in a while. Especially on my birthday of all days. I'm wondering if my "friends" are even worth it.
