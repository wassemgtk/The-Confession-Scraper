I've been becoming increasingly frustrated with the Cornell student assembly recently. Over the past week or so they decided to table and end discussion on a bill (related to divestment) before it even started and now they are trying to get rid of bus passes for first year students. And yet people running for student assembly why students either don't care about them or don't like them. They don't care about what's in the student body's best interest so why should we care about there's?
