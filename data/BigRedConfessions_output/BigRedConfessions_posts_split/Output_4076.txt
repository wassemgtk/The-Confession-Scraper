Why does everyone feel the need to tell me what to do, what is right, and what is acceptable? I am old enough to take my own decisions, make my own choices, and I don't need to take any advice from whiny bitches who don't even have their own shit together. Guys, stop judging so hard. If it isn't your business, don't try to make it your business. I'm going to live my life as I please, your opinions are really not important to me so stop annoying me with them. I have a lot of work this semester, it's hard enough to balance ordinary things as it is. I don't need my "friends" making it worse. Find another way to waste your time, bitch.
