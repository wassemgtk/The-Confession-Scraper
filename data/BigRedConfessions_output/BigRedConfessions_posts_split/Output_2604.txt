Why do I even try to talk to you still? You don't talk to me, when I message you I hardly ever get a response -- keeping in mind that I'm the only one who initiates these messages in the first place; you don't even look at me. What's the point?

I really hope I'm not actually stalking somebody unknowingly though.
