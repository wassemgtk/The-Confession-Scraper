During Spring of 2014, I used to sit in a circular table along with several girls and 1 guy. Every time the guy would arrive to class, I would get silent. I wouldn't even want to ask the TA for help because I didn't want him to hear my voice. I would just hide my paper and look at it and hope class would be over. I had trouble with the problem sets but his presence made my silent. 

It's not that I had a crush on him, but more so that I was scared of him. He seemed really manly. He reminded me of my past. I grew up in an abusive family. My dad and older brothers would beat me and sometimes use my hair to pick me up. They would call me a bitch all of the time. My dad would slap me if I had a boy friends or if I wore anything above my knees. I haven't had a conversation with my father and two older brothers since I was in elementary school and now I'm over 20 years old. 

I'm really sorry for being silent towards you last year. I would catch you glance towards my direction or maybe I was just being paranoid. You probably didn't notice it. It's something that I'm trying to fix. I hope one day, I won't feel so scared of men. I hope I can also share this story with my close friends. I hope I can also fix my relationship with my family.
