I feel like I'm fighting to face every day.  My grades suck, I can't concentrate, and I've started cutting myself again.  And it's not like I don't talk to anyone about it; I'm trying to be okay.  I talk to my friends and they support me, but I think they're getting tired of my complaining.  I get that and feel like I need to shut up and cope, but I really just can't.
