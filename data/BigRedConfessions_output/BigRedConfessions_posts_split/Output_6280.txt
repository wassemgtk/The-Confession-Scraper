"Some of the things you said on Friday were very hurtful. You probably don't know, or care, that I was having a very shitty day and the only reason I even went out was because my therapist told me to. You also don't know how I cried all the way home, how I sat on the floor of my room contemplating suicide, or at the very least doing some serious damage to my body. You don't know that I continued to cry the next day as I told a friend what had happened. I cried until my eyes were swollen and no more tears would come out.

I am so sorry that you are so unhappy and that the only way you can feel good is by hurting me. I am sorry you have no real friends, that you can't make a real connection with anyone because you're a selfish person. I am sorry that you are so miserable that you don't care about other people's feelings.

Most of all though, I am sorry that I let a bitch like you get to me. I should have realized early on that you weren't my friend, that to you friends are objects you can use to benefit yourself. I'm not surprised your boyfriend wants to leave, he deserves someone who appreciates all the love he has to give. You act like all you need in life is money, and that it's the only thing that matters, but newsflash sweetie, you can't buy friends or love with money.

I am glad I stopped talking to you, you are a toxic person. I can't wait until the end of the semester when you leave, I hope I never see you again, and I hope you choose to move out of the apartment. I can't stand seeing you every day. "
