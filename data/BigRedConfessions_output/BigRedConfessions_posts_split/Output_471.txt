"As a freshman I loved half the people on my floor but absolutely despised the other half. They were elitist assholes, and I sometimes dreaded returning home from classes in fear of having to see them. They made me feel small, and they somehow went on to achieve even more and more success while I felt like I was being crushed.

Things changed though. I finally found my confidence. I've achieved so much more this past year than I ever could have imagined, socially, academically, everything. And god does it feel so good to walk by those jerks on campus now with my head held high.

I'm the big one now.
