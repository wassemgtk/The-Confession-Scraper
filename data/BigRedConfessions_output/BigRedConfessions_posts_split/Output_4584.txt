Thank you to the person who emailed me after I lost my wallet. I am so grateful that you found it and bothered to help me, and you'll never actually know how much it meant to me. This week I lost my aunt to ALS and my grandmother had another stroke. I'm a transfer student so it's only my second week here, but I can honestly say that you have restored my faith in humanity. Go Big Red!
