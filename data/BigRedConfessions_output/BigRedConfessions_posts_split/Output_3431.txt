Saw this super pretty sophomore in red jacket this evening, at the Facebook event. I had been wanting to speak to her since I first saw her there, which I did get a chance to do 2 hours later. And she seemed like even nicer a person. And that smile!  <3 How I wish I could ask her out, get to talk to her for hours,get to know her,cuddle with her while watching movies, maybe date her (wishful thinking). (-_-)
For all I know, I will probably never see her again. Just want to say, (if you're reading this) - Stay your awesome self always. :)
