"I feel as if I have high standards for girls. Not so much physically, but more mentally. I find emotional maturity and confidence immensely attractive. I'm not one of those anti-hookup dogmatists; I've had my share of those and am perfectly fine with them.

But to be perfectly honest, every girl I've been with at this school, whether in a hookup situation or attempting at a relationship, has been either incredibly immature, shallow, or just plain awkward about it. I'm not sure if this is representative of Cornell or just coincidence. Is it so difficult to find mentally mature/ practically intelligent people?"
