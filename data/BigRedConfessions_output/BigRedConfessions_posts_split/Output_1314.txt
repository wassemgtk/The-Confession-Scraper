It's frustrating that I can't be talented at anything "practical", like STEM, accounting, business, social networking, etc. Things that will supposedly give me a more stable life. Instead, I have the most useless **** talents that won't take me anywhere- or if they do, it will be with great risk, determination, etc. which I just don't have. Life is unfortunately biased towards the "smarter" STEM people. People who enjoyed building computers when they were 10 years old, and not say, painting pictures. These people have it so easy in that they get all the well-paying jobs that they ALSO happen to enjoy doing. There is a demand for their work, and I can understand why. After all, "practical" fields are the reason we have so many of the advancements we do today.Other talents, such as music, art, and so forth only add beauty to an otherwise black and white world. Don't get me wrong, they have their own merits too, but one really has to be extraordinary in order to make a good living with them. I guess I'm just jealous that some people are able to get jobs/internships so easily while other people like me have to struggle, or settle for being an average player in a "practical" field, instead of being able to do what I'm more naturally inclined towards. I just really needed to get that out of my system.
