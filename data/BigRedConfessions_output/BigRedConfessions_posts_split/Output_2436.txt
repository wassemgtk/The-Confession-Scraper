I'm a prospective freshman and I visited Cornell expecting to commit right away. Instead, I felt left out and concerned. I didn't click with anyone all weekend and I feel like I'm not "long islandy" enough for this school. I thought people here would be liberal (I am very much so) but this is the first place I've heard people use "fag" as an insult in over four years and I'm still hearing people say that social issues don't matter. 
My biggest issue though was people downing on the school. I came in ready to say every other school sucks and that Cornell was the best, but people I met seem more resigned to being here than thrilled. I was told to go to Duke instead of here and it seems like everyone sort of thinks of Cornell as a fallback school even though it's an incredible place.
Also it's freezing.
