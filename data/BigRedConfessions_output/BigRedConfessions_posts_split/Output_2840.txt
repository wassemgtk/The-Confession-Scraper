"My friends pressure me to go out every Friday and Saturday and I just don't want to. I rather sit inside and just enjoy life in the moment. It annoys me when they say, ""We need to be always trying to get ass, because if we don't get it, some lame kid will."" That makes sense, but I don't like the party atmosphere. Back when I used to go out, I have memories of these girls who are mediocre to hit, acting high and mighty when I try to interact with them. I remember the guy being the life of the party(most vibrant and funny) getting the most attention but I don't like that style, it feels too try hard to me. So now I just avoid parties all together.

Also, the really attractive chicks don't go to parties, they have enough men in their life to take them on dates and events that the party scene can be avoided. I rather figure out a way to get these 'regular girls' to like me than the 'party girls'."
