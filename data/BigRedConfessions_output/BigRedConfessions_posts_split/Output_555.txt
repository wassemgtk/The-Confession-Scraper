"Saturday night November 14, 2014, I went to Pixel with my friends. We were graduating in December and wanted to spend the last few weekends we had together.

Someone took my blue Northface coat that night. That coat was my sister's. At the time she was in the army, and she still is. I had not seen her for a year and a half that November, and it was going to be another year and a half before I would see her again. 
The coat was worn and faded- it had small holes in the elbows and on the cuffs. It had a buckle belt, and a hood with tan fur. There was a pink scarf stuffed in the sleeve and my keys in the pocket. (The scarf was also a gift from a family I used to babysit for, before they moved to a different state). I posted pleas all over Facebook that week asking for the return of the coat and scarf. I received no replies. 

It was a Northface, yes, so maybe I can understand someone wanting to steal it, but it was well worn, faded, and a treasure from a sister that I am not able to see often. The same sister who may be sent to Afghanistan on duty very soon.

When people steal during college, they don't care about the damage that they can do. It's easy to gloss over the fact that there may be meaning behind something as simple as a scarf or a hat or a coat. The walk back home from Pixel that night was very cold, but all I felt was burning anger, frustration and resentment. And I still do. It also angers me more knowing that a good Samaritan would have realized they had taken someone's coat the next morning after a drunk night, and would have tried to return it.

I know it's been over a year since this person stole my coat. I've tried to forget and move on, but the memory still stings bitterly. It may seem like I am overreacting to many, but it is not the material object that I miss. It is the history that the coat has witness, through my sister's personal struggles and my own. I didn't care about the keys - those were easily replaceable. But that coat was absolutely irreplaceable. Knowing that the person who took it most likely left it callously and thoughtlessly in their house, and eventually it may have gone to the Lost and Found to go on to auction or possibly to the Dump and Run sale. In other words, my sister's coat is lost to me forever.

Please, before you steal someone's belongings from one of the bars in Collegetown, please realize what you are doing. Not only are you locking them out of their house that night, but you're leaving a scar as raw and angry and painful as mine still is.
