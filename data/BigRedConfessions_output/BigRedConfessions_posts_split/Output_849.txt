This is for 7186.

I was rejected from Cornell regular decision. To be honest, I was rejected from every single school I applied to (including my ED school) except for 3 in-state public schools. It was devastating and and for a long time, I thought my intelligence was tied with the name of my school. It took me a long time to realize that your college does not define you and your college experience is truly what you make of it. I eventually transferred after my freshman year and was accepted into a few schools, including Cornell. So, if Cornell is truly your dream, it is possible to transfer into this school. Either way, I just wanted to let you know that I know how you feel and I wish you joy and happiness for whatever happens throughout your application process.
