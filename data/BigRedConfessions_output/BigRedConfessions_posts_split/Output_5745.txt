I just watched the last movie for my government class, 3809. And I could not feel sadder right now. 

The relationships that happened through all of these movies remind me more of my inability to communicate and have relationships with people-- much less women.  

I've accepted being socially, physically alone. But it's doing irrevocable damage to my emotions. We weren't designed to be solitary creatures, I wish I learned how to communicate with people

I hope to learn how to talk to all of you someday--hell, maybe one of you will be my friend one day-- once I learn how.
