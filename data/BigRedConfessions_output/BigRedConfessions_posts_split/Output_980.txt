I lost a decent amount of weight over the course of the semester, and it made me feel pretty good. When I went home for thanksgiving though, everyone commented on how "NOW I looked good" and how "this is how I should be." Frankly it's all everyone talked about, and it made me feel awful. Were they just pretending I looked fine before? If I gain back the weight will I no longer be "the way I should"? It sucks because I've been scared that the way I've been eating has become disordered .... But now I feel the pressure to either lose or maintain my weight. I don't know what to do...
