"I believe in miracles, because if they didn't exist you wouldn't have, bit by bit, come back into my life when I need you most. I'm so glad to have you back, my love. You can be certain that I wouldn't want to spend my time with anyone else-because you understand me, unconditionally. You empower me as a woman. Sure, we are not perfect and we have our interesting moments, but those moments aren't so bad. Through all that we immensely care for each other, and that's what matters. 

If someone's meant to be in your life, they'll bust down that door even if you put a thousand locks on it-they love you. <3

Props to all the power couples out there.
