To the rude girl in PSB on Sunday night: the study rooms in Clark are QUIET study rooms. This means PLEASE don't come in at 11 PM on a weeknight to play tag on the swivel chairs and endlessly talk at your boyfriend while he attempts to study. Do some homework (although I seriously doubt you have any). Check Facebook. Read a book. Ponder life. Or (even better), leave. There's a reason I come here to study and that is to get away from inconsiderate, noisy people such as yourself. Shut the heck up or leave.
