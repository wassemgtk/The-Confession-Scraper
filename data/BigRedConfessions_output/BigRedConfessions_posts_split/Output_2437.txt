This weekend I visited an old friend at another college. The second I set foot there, people greeted me, asked what my name was and all about me since they'd never seen me. I felt incredibly welcomed, and like I'd gone there for years. No talk of school work, or anything stressful for that matter. I was instantly part of a family. Pure and absolute bliss. 
I mention this story because it is a stark contrast to the experiences I've had at Cornell. There's a prevalent sense of unhappiness and discontent that fills the air. Every person I've told here that I go to Cornell responds the same way. It's primarily labeled as a depressing, miserable place to be despite its high academic caliber.

I don't think Cornell is a family. It doesn't even feel like a community. I feel like I couldn't even sit at a table with someone without them wanting me to go away. It feels like an overcrowded fish bowl where the fish just sliver past each other in a robotic and emotionless way. Any remote sense of community is just superficial, and its practically like everyone at Cornell left their emotions and happiness in some other place. 

Its an absolute dystopia, and too many people are unwilling to admit it.
