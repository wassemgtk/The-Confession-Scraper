It's hard to admit I still think about you. We met for the first time last semester in class and we worked on a few assignments together. I didn't realize until the end of the semester, just as Thanksgiving break, finals and winter break were rolling in, how I felt about you. I had my chances to talk to you after class, but I blew every single one of them because I'm so damn insecure and cowardly. Hell, I even had your number since we had to meet up outside of class for a project one time. But, no, I still couldn't work up the courage to talk to you. I really doubt that you that you thought about me the way I still think about you. You pop up in a dream at least once a week. But damn, dwelling on it is only making it worse for me, and I need to get over this for my own good.
