What is it about the basics of being human that make you not want to be around us? Yes I'm talking about YOU the reader! We, the social misfits and awkward, did not choose to be this way or at the very least I know I didn't. Circumstances from infancy did not prepare me well for the life I face today. For a good part of my life I have been avoiding people not because I don't like them, but because I don't have a clue how to interact and form healthy friendships and such. And I know you happy people have this BS thing about 'oh you've got to put yourself out there, and keep trying blah blah blah'. You have no idea how much I've been trying. But the more I try, the more people treat me like I'm a thing from a different world that they know nothing about. I always try to stay positive, and try to troubleshoot: What am I doing differently that is not working? Am I just too ugly? I'm I an automatic turnoff to people? For over two decades of my life humans have shit on me and I get no love from anyone whatsoever. People are even disgusted when they have to pair up with me in class for a group work/project. Now I'm fed up. I contemplated suicide but I don't want to go that way. Now I don't care about anyone, because no one did me. I did you no wrong, people. Why do you so resent me. You're creating a demon out of me, and when I'm fully groomed, I'll feed off of the evil the world has to offer. When I blow up, I want you to remember that you made me into the heartless person I am!
