I want to think that my life is perfect. I have a high GPA, various extracurricular activities, tons of work experience in my field, a good number of friends, and most importantly, a girlfriend who would do anything for me. Yet, I am still worried. I still go to bed every night depressed and thinking that my future is going to be complete crap. Many people would trade their life for mine in a heartbeat, but I hate my life. I've created such high expectations for myself that I just can't live up to them. Some nights I ask myself why I can't be happy with an A- and why I'm killing myself to get an A/A+. I just want this all to stop... The pressure is just way too much.
