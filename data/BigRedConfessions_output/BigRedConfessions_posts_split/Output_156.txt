"Today I learned that a guy who went to school with my older brother is a sales director at a 10+ year old startup that has over 50 million over 4 rounds of funding. The guy graduated at the bottom tier of our high school class, went to nyit, and basically joined the company as one of the first 5 employees straight out of college in a sales function role. The company hasnt been very profitable yet and Im sure he only just started making good money (100k+) recently with the latest round of funding that took place early this year. The guy is in his early 30s and the company was founded by an Ivy Leaguer over a decade ago. My brother graduated from MIT and works as top engineer at a great software firm. He makes pretty good money for his age and my mom and I are really proud of him. Although I wasnt as smart as my brother, I still worked hard and excelled compared to my peers. We're the sons of a low income immigrant (as is the sales employee in question) and have basically had to study and crawl our way to where we are today. 

I never thought I would be an elitist, prizing my pedigree and future salary above all else. I always believed that a school pedigree and a job are things that can be achieved with hard work. I know that there are many intelligent people who didnt go to college and many intelligent state school grads working at awesome companies. But I always thought they would be exceptional people who acquired inordinate amounts of knowledge and expertise in their fields to shine through. Basically what gave them success is what got most Ivy and sans Ivy Leaguers into college in the first place--hard work.

 But it hurt so fucking bad when I read about this sales guy. I dont know how much equity he has. But if it's another WhatsApp, which it might, he could potentially end up being worth over 100 million. I looked and searched thoroughly about him to see if he somehow wised up after high school and had some crazy accomplishments that caused the founders to hire him when he graduated 9 years ago. But I couldnt find anything. Why is life so cruel and unforgiving to many, yet so rewarding to those who deserve it least? Am I the sinner in this painting, because I envy a half-wit's success? I know my brother and I will never make that sort of money. And even if we do, this guy, in joining a memorable and profitable team, has still beat out the vast majority of engineers and inventors and businessmen in history, who are undoubtedly of a high caliber intellect, by being at the right place at the right time. Why should he succeed where so many others have not? Why can't I get over this??????
