I used to strongly associate people's looks with their personality. I know it's silly, but on a subconscious level, if someone was ugly and/or fat, I just  thought their existence was a little sad and prioritized interacting with other people, I thought of unattractive people as losers a little bit. And the uglier/fatter someone was, the more I put them in that category. Honestly it wasn't intentional, and not in a rude way, but I just naturally gravitated toward good looking people. And I've recently managed to remove this filter from my worldview, and I have to say it's like ridding yourself of a prejudice, like racism. And it's really eye opening, you can just experience more of life b/c you're exposed to more of the human condition, just quantity-wise. I'm generally a negative person who is always looking for reasons to be unhappy -- e.g. unattractiveness, and I guess I projected/attributed this to other people. And now that I've learned to perceive them as no different than anyone else, I've become happier too. This must be how racists feel. Prejudice is like a cage for your mind... Don't do it.
