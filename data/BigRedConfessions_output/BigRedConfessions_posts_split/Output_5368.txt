I miss you. When we first met I had the inkling that you liked me and I want to apologize to you for being so darn busy that I couldn't start anything. You asked me to give you a call and I never did-- not because I did not want to but by the time I could, I figured it would be out of the blue and too awkward. I want to be with you, but now you've joined a sorority and I am sure you are so surrounded by guys you probably don't think of me anymore. I've never been able to talk to someone so easily, and if we can't be together, at the very least I don't want to lose a promising friend.
