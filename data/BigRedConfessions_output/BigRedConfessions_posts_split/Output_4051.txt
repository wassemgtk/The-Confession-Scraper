"Sunday morning rain is falling
Steal some covers share some skin
Clouds are shrouding us in moments unforgettable
You twist to fit the mold that I am in
But things just get so crazy living life gets hard to do
And I would gladly hit the road get up and go if I knew
That someday it would lead me back to you
That someday it would lead me back to you

That may be all I need
In darkness she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
And I never want to leave. . . 

Do you remember when you sang this to me as we were both lying on my bed?  You were lying on top of me, looking into my eyes and you said between kisses that this song described everything you were feeling.  I was your light in the darkness. I asked you if we could make this our song and you said yes with a smile. . . This past Wednesday my lab TA played it during lab and I was torn to pieces.  The pain rushed in through my veins as this scene, deeply stored in my memory, replayed. 

If you texted me, unblocked me from Facebook, called me, e-mailed me, came looking for me, I'd answer you.  See I've come to realize that, as much as I hate it, our love is like Olivia Pope and Fitzgerald Grant's.  I will be here loving you every time you come back to me.  We'd both attempted to restrain ourselves from one another in the past but all our efforts were futile.  Maybe I should be ashamed, worried, or embarrassed if you read this confession because to you and only YOU will it be really obvious that I wrote it, but screw it. You know I speak my mind.  

I think of you almost every waking moment of my life and you need to know.  You need to know how much I still love you and how every single little spot on this campus has your presence etched in it.  You need to know how incomplete I feel without you.  I feel like my best friend is gone.  The only other person on the planet who could understand me better than I do myself, is gone and I don't know what to do.  You have no idea how my life has been literally falling apart since you left.  It was almost  like a domino effect.  You left, and all stability and luck left with you.  My friends are falling apart, my dreams, and everything I've worked for these past 4 years has been falling apart too and I'm carrying all of this on my own.  I'm strong yes, but even strength needs support.  I feel so alone when at the end of the day, I lay in my bed all by myself.     I don't look forward to coming back to my room because I know I'll come back to emptiness.  A year ago, I came back to your arms, your smile, your support, your love, and no matter how terrible my day had been, YOU were always a source of strength that motivated me. I'm so broken and I'm pretty sure you're not whole either.  Dammit, I wish your love for me was greater than your fears.  I love you so much still.  "
