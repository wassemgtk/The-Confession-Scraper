Not to be offensive or anything but I'm tired of GDIs texting me, asking me about parties and pretending to be my friends just so they can get invites. Seriously I'm not your party planner, and I don't party all the time goddamit, sometimes Greeks like to watch Netflix and stay in bed on weekend nights too.
