I feel like a terrible person for thinking this way, but one of my Facebook friends constantly posts about their depression. And I want them to get better, but I find myself getting annoyed at the constant reminders every time I refresh my newsfeed. It feels very attention-seeking to me, because I personally would never publicize any illnesses I may have, physical, mental or otherwise, and especially not on a platform where I'm broadcasting myself to a host of barely-acquaintances.
