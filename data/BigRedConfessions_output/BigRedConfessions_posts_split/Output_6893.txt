"I'm not trying to make it awkward between us, but you never gave me a fair shot. I tried everything I could but you simply didn't and don't want me.
No, we can't be friends, because it's impossible to not fall in love with you every time I look into your eyes.
So I'm going to be selfish, and never talk to you or meet your eyes anymore. It's all for the best."
