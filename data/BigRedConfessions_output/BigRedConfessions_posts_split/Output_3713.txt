"I wish I FULLY understood and appreciated how amazing it is to be at Cornell University during my first year here. 

As a Senior, I JUST realized that this may be the last time when I'll be surrounded by thousands of people from all over the world, who are around my age, doing and studying amazing and wonderful things almost everyday!

Where and when can I just start conversation with someone at a bus stop, cafe, or dining hall only to discover that person is researching how to prevent aging in humans, a Division I track star, or swam with shark in the Galapagos? 

When will I be able to take ANY course I want to AND be taught by some of the world's best professors? 

Gosh, I wish I fully appreciated what I have here at Cornell before my senior year. All I can do is make the best of the next semester! In short, take advantage of every opportunity of everyday here. You'll be glad you did."
