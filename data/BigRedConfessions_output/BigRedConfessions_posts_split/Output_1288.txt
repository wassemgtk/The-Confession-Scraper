I find it absolutely totally disgusting that people think it's okay to walk around in indoor common spaces in their bare feet. Nasty Nasty Nasty Gross! It's bad enough all these people slapping around in their little styrofoam string "shoes" but at least there's a barrier in between their toe fungus and the floor that we share. It is unsanitary and grosses me out to look at. I cannot believe that Cornell allows this to happen. Keep your bare feet at home and on the beach you nasty assty people!
