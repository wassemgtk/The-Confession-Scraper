I wish there was a device that I could attach to my penis that would allow me to pee whenever I wanted, and the pee would go into a tube that discretely connects to a reservoir in my backpack, or some such thing. But it wouldn't stay connected to my penis all the time, I could easily "connect" and "disconnect" to the system. And then guess what -- once the pee is cold, it can be used to liquid cool my custom built laptop, again through a system in my backpack. I should patent this.
