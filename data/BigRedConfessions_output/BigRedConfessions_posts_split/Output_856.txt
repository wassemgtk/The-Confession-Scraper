I recognize that sometimes ignorance isn't someone's own fault, the person was just never educated about the issue. However, I get very annoyed when people claim to have seen the world, when the only "abroad" they had seen were the fancy little cafes of Paris or the ancient buildings in tourist cities. 

No kidding people cannot empathize or even sympathize with people who are struggling from climate change, war zones, extreme poverty, and more - they've never come close to witnessing their toils. 

So the next time you think that pollution isn't an issue, or that people abroad are poor and homeless because they don't work as hard as Americans, please stop yourself from offending someone who can empathize with those affected.
