I don't know why some people find it alright to invade anyone's seat when there's clearly dishes on the table. Does it ever occur to you dickheads that there is someone eating there? Seriously, that is one of the rudest things I've seen. Today, I had to deal with it for the second time. I hope you enjoyed dealing with those dirty dishes. I didn't have to clean up after myself this time. Thanks... Cockfaced fools.
