As a female a semi-long distance relationship, I feel it is the equal responsibility of both partners to be considerate enough of each other's time and responsibilities by sharing visiting obligations. If I am still a student at this institution and I was the last one to plan out a trip to visit you for an extended period of time, of course I am going to expect you to be the one to make the next visit to me. As much as I would have liked to visit you this semester I haven't had the chance to yet, because I've been trying to keep up with my duties as a student, and this semester's course load has demanded much more of my time that previous semesters have. I know you understand my obstacles to visiting you, I know that you love me, but what I am wondering is why you haven't made the conscious effort to plan out a weekend you'll come visit me here in Ithaca. As the one bringing in a pretty stable income I would expect you to be able to prioritize a little, maybe cut back on some of the unnecessary things you spend on--perhaps alcohol, or not eating out a few times per week, just to spare about $100 of a bus ticket to come see me--once is all I ask. 

Why this is such a hassle, I don't know-especially when you suggest we should see more of each other, and stress that the physical alongside the emotional in a relationship matter.
I love you to pieces, but please don't diminish my unfinished responsibilities here at school. 
How do you think it makes me feel when you could have seen me those few weekends you were "bored" and traveled somewhere else?? I'm not asking you to worship me or not have fun going places, but please stop making excuses as to why you're not manning up to come visit the person you are in love with. 

I don't want to offend you. I just miss you and don't know how to approach you about this without sounding selfish or harsh. I guess this is just another step in our maturing process...
