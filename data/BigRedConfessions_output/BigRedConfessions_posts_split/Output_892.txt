I know that the day will come, and that I'm content with just myself, but I want a serious relationship again. I mean, I only have like four things I want in a guy: Love of animals, love of music (like all types), is kind/selfless/helpful, and some basic liberal ideals (identifies as a feminist, pro-gay marriage, etc.). I just want someone who's compassionate. Like I said, I don't mind waiting. I know I'm young and have plenty of time left. But god, I thought I would find at least one person who has these four qualities by now.
