"Last year I was depressed as hell. I felt like my circle of friends was eroding away as they went towards for fun and interesting people and I was still trying to get over some confidence problems from high school. On top of that, my family situation at home was deteriorating with sick family members and an uncertain financial future as the bills piled up. As I sunk to my lowest point, I somehow ignited a fire within myself. As much as I wanted to give up, accept personal and financial defeat, I knew that I couldn't. Failure was not an option. I don't know exactly how I'm going to muddle through everything that has been flung at me, but I do know this: whatever chasms appear on my path, I will leap over them. Whatever obstacles come my way, I will shatter them. I am not going to sit idly by and let the world try and tear me down. I may not have as many assets, or connections, or wealth as other here, but I won't let that deter me. I am going to regain my confidence; I am going to earn a killer GPA; I am going to become more involved on campus; I will work until I have nothing left give; I will reign in a new and true circle of friends; I will emerge victorious and successful and restore my family to financial security. I may not get there tomorrow, or next week, but I can see my path, and I know what I must due. I cannot fail. I REFUSE!!!!
