Everyday is a new low. Just when i think i cannot feel worse, i start feeling worser. I have literally stopped interacting with people because i do not feel any connection with anyone. I do not want to constantly crib to them on how i feel. I work hard and will keep working harder. I wont give up, i will try harder until i succeed or until i perish. Quitting is not an option. Just need something positive to hold onto and i pray to god that i get through this.
