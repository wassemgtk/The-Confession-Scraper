I'm sorry for what I put you through. The truth is, I was scared of losing you, so I did anything I could think of to try to hold on. I was being selfish. You put me in a position that I was too inexperienced to handle, and everything kind of blew up in my face all at once.

I wish things had been different. I still think about you all the time. I want to know how you're doing. I want to know everything that's been happening. But I know what we had is long gone.

You were the most important thing in my life and the best thing to have ever happened to me. I just wish I could stop thinking about you. But at the same time, I don't want to stop."
