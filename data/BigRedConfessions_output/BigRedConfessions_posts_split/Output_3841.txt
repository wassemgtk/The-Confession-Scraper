I did two years of college before coming to Cornell. Cornell is incredibly academically and intellectually unchallenging, with the difficulty coming from how bullshit class work is. Nothing I do is interesting, and half of it is shit I already did before coming here. How the hell do I motivate myself to write an eight page essay on shit or do 50 math problems in three days?
