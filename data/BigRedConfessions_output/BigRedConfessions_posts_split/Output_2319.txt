It is so hard to happy when you have roommate if you're an introvert. I feel like I have no time to myself because he is always there. It's really making me upset and driving me insane. Just having another person present in the room bothers me. I don't like him only because he never leaves the room which I know is not a legitimate reason to dislike someone. What makes it worse is that I got stuck with a random roommate again. I guess my luck is just that bad.
