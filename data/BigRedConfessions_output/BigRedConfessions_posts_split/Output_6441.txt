Since coming to college, I've subconsciously friend zoned pretty much every attractive guy to come into my life. As a result, I'm the only one out of my close friends not to have been in a relationship in college, and I have a super good looking bunch of close guy friends. Lol, worst. Maybe someday I'll break the trend.
