"It had been a while since I signed into Spotify; I did, today, and since we’ve followed each other, I saw your most recent playlist.  January 8th, the day after we broke up.  Four songs, called “Freedom.”

At first I was just dumbfounded.  You know I follow you, so was this a cruel joke?  Some way to hurt me?  But no, you’re better than that.  I knew you wouldn’t do it intentionally.

And then I realized…that makes it worse.  That was you being honest.  You made yourself a pump-up playlist celebrating your liberation.  Our relationship had confined you, boxed you, and oppressed you so much that you made a playlist of celebration anthems.

Before this, I had come to a sense of peace.  I was thankful for everything that we had and shared, for what I had learned, and for what I had been able to feel that for so long I had feared I would never feel.  I felt accomplished, successful; my first relationship had yielded years of love, intense and reciprocated passion, and a fearless commitment to intimacy.  That was exactly how I wanted to remember my first love and my best friend.  That was the way I could have a sense of peace and contemplative fondness; in moments when I felt lonely, I would have a treasure trove of beautiful moments to draw upon and could take comfort in the knowledge that I once had, and would have again, something so wonderful.

That’s completely gone now.  That’s the most tragic of all; the true broken heart.  Now, everything I thought I knew about love has melted away.  The trust that I had that I would be loved that fiercely again has evaporated.  Now when I remember our years together, I’ll only remember the prison I trapped you in.  And the joy you felt when you could be a Freebird.  Lord help you, you can’t change.
