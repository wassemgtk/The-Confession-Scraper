I loved my four years at Cornell and it will be sad to leave. But one thing I really hate is that many locals who work on campus, local businesses, the cab companies, and city services like TCAT are racist against Asians, particularly against Chinese, Koreans and Indians. And they are very open about it. I'm happy to be leaving this behind. I hope Ithaca wakes up and addresses this.
