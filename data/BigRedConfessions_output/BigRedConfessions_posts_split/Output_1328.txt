I thought that maybe because our half of the friend group is living on West, that maybe you would hang out with us as much as you did last year. But honestly everytime we try to grab dinner you either 1. don't respond or 2. you're just like oh whoops, I fell asleep. I get that we're friends. so its comfortable but still you gotta show some respect. Like I can see you replying to some other group message a couple hours later, don't just ignore my message. I don't even think you realize how you come off as. 

Then every time you see me youre like oh! i havent seen you in so long! yeah well why do you think that is haha
