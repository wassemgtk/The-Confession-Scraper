"I can come off as aggressive, borderline abrasive, and a little bit scathing. It's because my family has always been a little bit oppressive, and expects me to come out as a cookie-cutter perfect girl, who listens to everything they say and doesn't ask questions. It's made me pretty bitter. I've missed out on some really essential parts of the American childhood, and the few things that I got to do, I've had to scream and argue for. Even now, I'm fighting them to stay on my pre-professional career path. They'd rather I finish my undergrad and get married, of course, to a guy of their choosing. I don't want to do that. I want to have a career I love, and a family when I'm ready. So I work my ass off. I study all the time. I want to prove to them that I can do this, and that I WILL decide my future. 
So when you see me, and I have my headphones in, and I'm looking pissed-- I'm not actually pissed. I'm not a horrid, constantly frowning bitch. I'm not always stressed either. I'm just determined to succeed, because there's a lot riding on this one. Please don't judge me harshly. Get to know me first."
