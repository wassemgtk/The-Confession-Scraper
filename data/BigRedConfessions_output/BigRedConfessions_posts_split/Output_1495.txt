Cornell is probably the worst choice I could have made. I cannot ever pass my exams with anything more than a 67. I should have stayed at the community college where I took my leave and got a 2-year degree and went into the workforce. I am a worthless loser who deserves to have a manual labor job like I had this past summer working in a warehouse. I cannot wait to finally drop out after this semester is over, hoping to at least get a few C's so that I could transfer it back to the community college back home. I also hate the fucking weather here like WTF, it's snowing and it is not even November yet?
