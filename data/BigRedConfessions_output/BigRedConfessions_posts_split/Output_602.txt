"The whole horn-tooting the university is doing over Klarman Hall (the first ""humanities"" building in 100 years) annoys me. No, it's not a fucking humanities building. There's one room dedicated for teaching (a 330-seat auditorium). It's a building dedicated to office space. The atrium is nice, or would be if there were enough tables and chairs for students to use. Every time I've walked through the building there are a bunch of people strewn around the floor or against the wall.

The Arts and Sciences administrators, and some departments, probably do need the office space. Humanities students at Cornell are relegated to some of the smallest and oldest buildings at Cornell. Just don't act like making a shiny addition to another old building on campus is a huge renewal of support for the humanities at Cornell."
