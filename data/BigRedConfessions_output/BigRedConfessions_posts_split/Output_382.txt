Recently, there has been a conflicting battle of thoughts in my head. I'm struggling to find meaning in a meaningless world. I'll be graduating in May and once I begin working, I will be making a cubicle my home. I will spend more time there than anywhere else. But why? I don't know if I'll be happy with that. The other part of me knows that I need to earn money to support myself. I'm trying to be practical. The worst part is that I have no one to talk to about this. I'm largely against seeking help from therapists and I'm not close enough with anyone here. I have friends in my major but without the common theme of work and projects I don't see myself connecting with them at all. I'm not much of a party person and I'm too shy to make friends. But in the end, none of it will matter. I will never see these people again. Then why did I bother getting to know them? Is it because I needed help on problem sets? As I reflect on these past years, I'm left asking myself: why? Why did I go through all this? What was the meaning of all this? I've never connected with anyone here? Will I ever? I did what was necessary to get good grades and graduate but it seems I lost my personality and reason for living somewhere along the way. I'm not suicidal but everything feels so fake and empty.
