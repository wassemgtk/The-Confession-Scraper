I always thought my safe space at Cornell was impenetrable to trolls or anything else, but they I was faced with reality. Reality can pass through anyone's safe space and tell them "like it is." I am glad I was faced with a spoonful of reality because I realized that my ideas were very leftist and I was living in lalala land. My friends helped me go register to become a Republican and to help save others from the idea that the whole world is a liberal arts campus, because it is NOT.
