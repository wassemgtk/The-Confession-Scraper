Sometimes I feel like people don't understand me. People feel that I am ignorant for not sharing their ideas.  I came to this country for a  better education than the one offered in my country. I love to learn. I like the fact I will be educated in the future. That's what people don't get from me: All I care about is my education.

      American students, specially kids here in this so called "Ivy League" school live their lives up to "that GPA". They take a class and all the time they are thinking of their GPAs. If they don't do a HW, they fear their GPA will be affected blah blah blah. Yes, I do care about my GPA but not that much (yes before you attack me my GPA is very low) but the point I want to get across is that GPA is not the only door opener; you can be successful regardless of what your GPA is.

      I am a vivid example of that. I am a researcher (yea that's because I like to learn), and a student in Engineering. There are tons of opportunities that aren't open to me at Cornell just because I don't have that high GPA that supposedly is required but let me tell you you can do much more without having a high GPA. I have gotten accepted to research programs and internships that students with a 3.7 or above have been rejected to, such as research positions in other Ivy Leagues and internships in NASA. You may not believe me but it's true; you can get accepted to any program you want as long as you write an excellent application and show that you know your stuff through your essays and statements and that all you care is about learning and not an internship to just show on a stupid paper saying "I DID THIS AND THAT" then get a job after graduation. That's the key to internships and research positions; you can't just say "OH I HAVE A HIGH GPA AND I DESERVE THIS BECAUSE OF THAT".  

To conclude, to those out there struggling finding internships and/or research positions for this Summer, don't feel bad for rejections and don't feel bad because you don't have a high GPA. While I do want you to do good and work as hard as possible (my low gpa is no indicator of my hard work), I do want you to care for your learning. When you fail or get a below the mean on a prelim, don't feel bad. Just think that there is something that you are missing and find that "something". Grades are not indicator of who you are as a person, or indicator of your hard work. However, if you do care for your learning, embrace it, and dedicate yourself into it. Education lasts forever, GPAs don't. 

Lastly, if you don't share my point, I respect it and please respect mine. I do prefer someone knowledgeable with a low GPA than someone with a high GPA that got an A in a class that he/she forgot after taking the final. I invite you to invest in your learning and take the advantage of this opportunity you have been given at this school. If you don't like to learn and you are here for a high GPA then a good job, this was not meant for you. 

P.S. Look at famous people around. Gates was a Harvard drop-out. Einstein was thought to be mentally disabled and got bad grades in school. Newton, the same.
