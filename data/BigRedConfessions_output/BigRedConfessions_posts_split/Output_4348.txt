I try to not be judgmental of others, but I absolutely despise it when a smoker sits near me in the library or in lecture. (You can always tell a smoker by the disgusting stench that surrounds them 24/7.) Please, smokers, do everyone else a favor and keep your distance! And DON"T smoke in public, especially outside building doors or on paths!
