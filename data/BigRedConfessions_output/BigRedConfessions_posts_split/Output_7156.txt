I feel like I'm being punished for having hard working parents. Most of the people I know who have financial aid, their mothers don't work. Both my parents have worked very hard to provide for their children, but they still don't get any assistance. Whereas people who's parents haven't worked that hard get financial aid. Is that fair?
