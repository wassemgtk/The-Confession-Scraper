To my boyfriend's roommate, yes, we had sex while you were asleep. Yes, when you walked in and we both claimed to be too cold to poke more than our heads from the covers, you really did walk in on us having sex. No, of course those were my underpants, not his, lying on your floor. When you came in and we were getting handsy on top of his philosophy books, that really was because talking about Socrates got us both hot for each other #nerds. When I left when he was in the shower and came back with wet hair, I had sex with him in your shower. I'm so sorry that he didn't manage to get a single next year. We'll (try to) keep the poetry sex down to a minimum.
