"When I was 4 or 5, my mom had me lie to my dad about her meeting up with another man. I realized what was going on and did nothing to stop it. She justified so many lies to me and I started doing it as such a young age. I can remember lying to other kids about ridiculous facts about who I was and where I had been. I'm a pathological liar. I can't stop. I can't even be honest with therapists. I know that some people can tell, and it's really embarrassing. I've told so many conflicting lies to so many different groups of people that I honestly don't know what the truth is sometimes. 

I've remained emotionally distant in most of my adult relationships. I feel like I'm always trying to hide some deep truth about myself, when really I'm just so insecure with whatever's left of my true identity. I'm afraid my lying is going to prevent me from ever truly connecting with another person. Last year I let someone in just a little, then I pushed her away and blamed her for the relationship failing.

Some days I just sit in my room and get high or drunk all day because I'm so ashamed to show the world who I am. I just wish I could be normal, even if it meant that people could see how damaged I am."
