I have a crush on someone I can never have. Weirdly enough, I'm not even upset. I'm relieved. After being stuck in a shitty relationship, for a while afterwards I was terrified that dating one supreme asshole had turned me off from men altogether. Even though the guy I'm crushing on can't be mine, the fact that I can crush on someone, someone who's actually a decent person, just gives me this huge sense of relief. It's nice to be reminded that good people DO exist, not everyone is as bad as that asshole. It's nice to know that I'm still capable of feeling attraction to another person. And I can't wait to crush on someone else in the future, someone who I actually CAN pursue.
