You’re here so close just a few miles away. I could go visit you anytime but I’m not sure if I can. I hate you I really do. Maybe hate isn’t the right word I resent you. I resent everything you put me through growing up without you. No concrete memory of you just figments made up about you from things I discovered about you. But I can’t blame you no matter how much I want to. I shouldn’t hate you because you and I are nothing. There is no connection not any shared time.  I do have one question for you. When you held me when you were there and I was there for those slight moment our lives crossed each other’s did you love me like any parent loves their child. But did you love me? Did I have any sort of impact in your life? Because your absence had a huge impact on my life but did my absence affect yours. Did you feel anything the moment you first held me and looked at me? Did you feel warmth or love that I was your baby a small innocent creature in your hands? Were you protective of me did you have the instincts of a father or not? I really do not care about how complicated your situation was or how I could never understand.  Why did you not look after me indirectly or from afar? Why abandon me? In the end running away didn’t prevent karma from catching up to you. Did you love your other kids? Or are you some sort of sociopath? Who care only about himself? I’ll ask you all these questions if I face you but I don’t know if I’ll be able to. Facing you will be me acknowledging a ghost. Someone who haunts my mind but isn’t there only a figment of my imagination by facing you I will be making you a reality, an actual person with a voice to answer all these doubts and questions. I’m glad that all those millions did not help your fate in the end, good luck in prison where your money does not matter.
