"Last semester was absolutely horrible. I feel that the only way to move on is to forget everything. I don't know how long this method that will last, because I feel like I might slip back into that state again. I think part of the problem is because I do not have much of a social life. I act very strangely and immaturely around people. I need to do something about it, because it is getting worse and worse. I am thinking about rushing, which I should have done last year, but I am scared I might not get in, because I am not outgoing and I look hideous :(. I don't even have enough cute things to wear for rush. Greek life is so financially expensive, but also so socially worth it, so I am very conflicted. I don't want to join band, although you people sound really nice. I really should get a job or join a team, but I feel like I am not qualified enough, and I don't have the motivation for applications and interviews and rejection. I don't know what else to do besides not thinking about it.  

I would greatly appreciate any suggestions for groups/activities I could join next semester that might make me happier and let me meet new people. Thanks in advance :)!"
