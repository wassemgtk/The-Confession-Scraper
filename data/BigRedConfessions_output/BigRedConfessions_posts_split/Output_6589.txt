Here's a confession:
somehow I'm afraid of weekends. Yeah it sounds like I'm crazy, but I just get really depressed when other people are going out and I'm staying in (either because of other commitments, simply too tired, or depressed about not being able to find a girl etc). 
I rarely get enough sleep on weekends either, since I'm so busy. 
Then lastly it's the fear and jealousy that the girl I really really liked might be hooking up with someone right now (she's gorgeous). 
There's nothing to look forward to for weekends.
