Im a freshman and I didn't know Cornell doesn't decorate before I read your post. Why the fuck not? What's so politically correct about not decorating for a specific religion's holidays? Why not instead decorate for Hannukkah Christians and Ramadan? This also alludes to how people view religion here; why antagonise it? For some reason people talk about their religious friends as if they were gullible or na√Øve. The biggest issue with youth today is false entitlement to their rights that come at the expense of others'.
