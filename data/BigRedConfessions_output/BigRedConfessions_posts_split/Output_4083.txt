I'm usually very good at getting over girls, I can get over them in a matter of days or at the least a couple of weeks. I'm too sensitive and volatile to be in a relationship so this is what keeps me functioning on a regular basis. But this semester I've been around a certain girl that I just can't seem to get over, no matter how damn hard I try. It's ruining my ability to concentrate in classes; I don't want to tell her I like her because I don't want to be in a relationship but I honestly have no idea how I'm to get over her when I'm around her quite often-it feels like a prison.
