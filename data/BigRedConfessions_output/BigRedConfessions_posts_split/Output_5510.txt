Since we broke up, I've had a couple of interests but every one of them was the same: a short period of infatuation before getting to know him and realizing that he is not even half as good as you are. I miss you and I wonder if we broke up because you were just being the typical college boy wanting the "college experience", or if it was I who ruined the beautiful thing that we had.
