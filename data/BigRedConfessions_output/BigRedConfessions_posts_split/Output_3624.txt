I think my professor just cried a little bit when we said goodbye after her last OH. It is an intro level language class I took for fun. I first talked to her in September because someone very important to me and I are both struggling with our mental health problems and I missed a lot of homework. I was never the star in the class. I skipped classes. I didn't turn in all the homework or submit it late. I didn't have the best pronunciation. My grades were probably just a little above the mean. I only went to her OH a couple of times. And we were not even that close. Yet every conversation I had with her felt so sincere and personal. This is my fourth year at Cornell, but it is the first time I ever feel that I have some sort of connection with a professor, a professor who will remember me after the semester ends. When we were outside her office, she said "I can't stand too close to you. I am already getting so sentimental." And I saw tears in her eyes. I cried when I walked home. Thank you so much for a great semester. I learned, I made friends and I met a wonderful professor like you.
