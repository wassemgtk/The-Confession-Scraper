i really need to vent but im not really close to the friend that i vent to anymore. this week may be one of the shittiest ive ever had, and on top of that, theres been some hella melodramatic feels ive been repressing for 3 years now. also im fucking up here becuz im distracted but normally i can handle this school shit like its nothing. like im not bragging but academically, with te exception of math, i have never actually had to work super hard to excel. even at cornell and i know im gonna get hate for saying that but fuck you, dont be mad cuz im smart. but socially ive always been a mess and lately thats been getting me off my groove. and i know im supposed to put academics first but its hard when you dont really have any close friends. i eat alone, i sleep alone, i spend most days alone and its been that way for awhile. also im tired of being single, tired of hating everyone around me, tired of editing and packaging myself so im more palatable to people who i honestly wouldnt give a fuck about if i didnt need human interaction. I have 1 real friend here and i still dont really trust him. and there is one person here who understands me at all and i fucked that up before i even got here to the point where we arent even speaking. i just dont have the energy to keep up the facade of being "okay" or "mentally balanced" or "a functioning member of society" anymore. i feel like its my sublime destiny to hold the world in the palm of my hand. but everyday, its slipping farther and farther away and if i cant be that person, whats the fucking point. my mental state is akin to narcissus, after years of self admiration, having a flaw pointed out by a stranger and then being unable to see anything else. Fuck this shit
