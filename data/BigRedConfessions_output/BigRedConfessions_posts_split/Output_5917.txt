"I'm going to be real. What does it take for a guy to get some pussy around here? Or in a relationship? Don't get me wrong, I'm a reasonably attractive guy with good physical features and many girls find me attractive, I mean, check my Tinder ;). I'm stuck with countless hookups who give sub-par BJs and rough tugging HJs (I can honestly do better myself). 

I feel like a good portion of the girls here are fake as fuck and won't give you the time of day unless you're in a certain frat or play a sport (even if they suck bad). You get [their] number and the first text there's no reply, even when you two hit it off perfectly. Like why give away your number if you don't want to talk to me or you half-ass the conversation? You invite them to lunch, dates, etc., to get to know them but then they either find some bullshit excuse, but say they're still into you. Or they flirt with you but ultimately don't reciprocate your energy. WTF? Stop playing games, it's so stupid. 

I try to be as direct as possible with these girls (not women, until I find some worthy of that title), but the other half of them are damaged as fuck from past relationships or are just socially awkward. Many of these girls don't know what they want. You want a date? Sure, I got it. You want to get lunch to get to know each other? Fine. Want me to be romantic, funny, outgoing, involved on campus, strong, and independent? Dig Bick? (bet you read that wrong) Treat you right? Motherfucking check all of that and more! 

I'm willing to make you feel good, just give me the chance to show you. "
