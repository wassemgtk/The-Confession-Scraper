I'm gay. So incredibly gay. All my friends at Cornell know. But back home, basically the only one who knows is my girlfriend. Leading a lesbian double life is really hard. Especially when your grandma tells you, "Just don't go off and be one of those dykes. That's sickening." I'm so ready to stop hiding. But even now, I'm scared of the consequences.
