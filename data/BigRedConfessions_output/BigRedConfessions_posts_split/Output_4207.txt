Spending the semester in Moscow - It's amazing, I am a superstar here. Superhot girls talk to me all the time, they are supernice, they carry the conversation and then they follow up. And not poor and struggling ones looking to make international contacts, really well-traveled well-connected superrich Muscovites. It's really amazing. I get that I'm somewhat interesting here, but this is definitely not warranted. Girls of similar attractiveness at Cornell or in NYC would not talk to me ever, or it would take a herculean effort to keep their attention for 3 minutes, only to lose it to one of the other hundreds of men competing for it. I'm so used to having little to no access to anyone who's above a 7 -- to see what the world looks like with hot girls being interested in you. It's a different world. How ridiculous... And I'm not interested in any of the Russian girls here, but the attention feels nice, I won't lie. This is what it must be like to be an attractive person. You don't have to try to have a social life. It comes to you.
