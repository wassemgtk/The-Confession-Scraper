I always thought not to be biased  towards people with excessive tattoos and piercings, but now that I think about it, it's how you choose to present yourself to the world. If you want me not to judge, don't say harsh things about my J. Crew boots and Canada goose. 

P.S. I'm still not going to judge people with tattoos, just a thought.
