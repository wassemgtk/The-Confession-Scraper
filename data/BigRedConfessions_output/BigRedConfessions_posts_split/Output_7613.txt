Guy at CTB with the cool, partially shaved head and whippable hair and red scarf... when I first laid my eyes on your beautiful red scarf draped around your neck, I was like dayumm you got a heck of a fashion style. You're tall & you were chillin with your bros. I think you're super cute, and walking by you as CTB told us that they're closing simply left me breathless. I think you're a super chill guy and would like to get to know you more. Will fate bring us together again at CTB?
