Ate at Appel today with my friend's roommates. They were loud and boisterous and had no reservations using "fuck" every few words. I know this is college but I felt very uncomfortable especially because we were within earshot and in front of that nice Asian lady who swipes you in. I don't know whether I'm just uptight or whether it's okay to be uncomfortable with foul language.
