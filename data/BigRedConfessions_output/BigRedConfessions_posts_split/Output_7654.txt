The truth is I'm really insecure, to the point that when a guy is interested in me, I rarely take their interest to be sincere, even if they give me no reason to think otherwise. 4 years ago, my first "boyfriend" played me like a fool and already had a girlfriend. I was wondering why he'd come to my soccer game only to cheer for the other team... According to him, he was just cheering on his "best friend. They'd known each other since they were young." When I found out that they were actually going out for almost 2 years, I winded up cutting off contact with him and becoming friends with the girlfriend (I would, I know) until she found some old text where he called me cute and flipped out on me. When we played soccer against each other the next season, she attempted to beat me up (mostly just hair pulling and punching). Anyway, I'm not tiny/weak (not saying that if you're tiny you're weak! this girl was tiny and did her damage) but although I didn't come out really physically hurt, I was traumatized emotionally from the experience and didn't attempt to actually be with someone until years later. So now every time a guy likes me, the confident side of me says, "He should be into me. I'm awesome" and the insecure side of me thinks, "This is so transparent-clearly this is some big joke on me." I wish I didn't feel so scared and think I'm getting played for an idiot constantly. I wish I didn't feel like guys are playing a joke on me. I'm ashamed to say that because I should be secure enough with myself to not think it's April Fucking Fools constantly.  I know it's a little unfair but I actually think that guys plot these whole plans in their minds to mess with girls. While some guys do prey on girls' emotions, the majority of them don't go this far and probably wouldn't express interest as merely a ploy. Gahhhhh.
