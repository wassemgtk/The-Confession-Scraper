There's this girl who is a few years older than me that I really, really don't want to like but can't help fall for. I've been trying to avoid her but it's really hard since she's in a mutual class and also because I find it extremely difficult not to talk to her. I feel depressed when I'm with her and I feel depressed when I'm not with her. I can't focus on my academics solely because of this and it is very debilitating; I honestly have no idea what to do.
