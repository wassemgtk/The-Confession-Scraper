"Dear dad, I just want to tell you how much I hate and despise you.  You were an authoritarian and tyrannical bastard who used religion to suppress the opinions of anyone in the household who disagreed with you.  You sheltered me by force and you made me depressed to have any form of pleasure at all.  I hate you and I hate your religion.  You don't know how many nights I stayed up fearing that I would go to hell and be tortured forever. Even now, I feel the psychological effects of your grip in my life and you don't even care just as long as you're doing the will of your imaginary friend.  You were responsible for my depression and suicidal thoughts during highschool such that m first year here as a wreck and I had trouble adjusting. I hate you so much for every bit of what you've done to me. Fuck you.

Your angry son."
