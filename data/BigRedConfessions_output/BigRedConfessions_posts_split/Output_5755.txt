It's happening again. A guy really likes me for a while, we have a thing, and soon after he starts to like me less and less. Once he figures out I'm really pretty boring and we run out of things to talk about and the novelty wears off. It happened before; I can tell it's happening again, now, with you. I wish I could get rid of whatever it is that makes certain guys really fall for me before they realize they don't actually like me that much because it hurts so, so much.
