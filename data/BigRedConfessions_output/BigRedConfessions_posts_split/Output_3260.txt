I'm studying abroad now and I can easily say that it feels so much better on campus here not having to see people wearing their Greek letters, and talking about their mixers and formals 24/7. 

Not having to deal with the superiority complex of fraternity and sorority members has made my experience here so much better. All the students on campus much more friendly and people just want to go out and have a good time without the exclusivity and drama.

The ONLY thing I dislike about Cornell is the massive Greek presence. Can't say I'm looking forward to not having much to do on weekend nights again when I come back next semester.
