Although I was not able to actually pledge a fraternity because my parents felt that my grades were inadequate, they've realized now that they won't be getting much better. They finally understand the rigor here and so I'll probably be rushing next year. What I hate most is that living the geed life has taught me that it's much harder to make friends second semester because a lot of people are extremely judgemental. All I want to do here is do well, make long lasting friends and maybe meet a cute girl along the way. Hopefully next year will be better.
