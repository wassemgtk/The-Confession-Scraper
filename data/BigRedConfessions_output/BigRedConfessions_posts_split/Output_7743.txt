I feel like people become complacent with Cornell. It is an Ivy League University. You should be humbled by having this great opportunity every single day. No one DESERVES to be here. It is a privilege. I thank God every single day for letting me have this crazy opportunity i thought i would never have. Yes, I am an athlete, and I definitely wouldn't have been able to get accepted here on academics alone. I was considering some community colleges before I found out i was able to compete at a collegiate level. You can obviously see how different Cornell is from a community college.... Hearing the alma mater on the chimes often could bring tears of joy to my eyes, and everyone else seems to walk around like this campus is a prison. it sickens me.
