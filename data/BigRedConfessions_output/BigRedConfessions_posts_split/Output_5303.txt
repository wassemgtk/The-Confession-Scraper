Every time I laid down on my bed to nap, my roommate has kept asking me if I was tired. The first time I told her "I'm always tired." And each successive time, it was "what did I tell you before?", and she, "You're always tired?"
So the last time, she finally asked "why are you always tired?" and I clammed up, as usual. 
...not ready to tell all the people I'm close to about my depression to their faces yet...
But the funniest thing about depression is that it makes it ever so hard for one to do the things they need to do to help themselves and get well...
