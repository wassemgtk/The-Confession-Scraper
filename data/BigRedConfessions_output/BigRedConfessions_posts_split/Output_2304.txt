You say you still love me, but you choose to break up with me anyway. I have trouble believing that. If you truly loved me, you should have at least told me and we could have worked on it. Aren't we supposed to fight for those we love? I know I did. Whatever issue I had (which wasn't often), I communicated it to you, and we worked it out.

The breakup is super painful as it is, but it stings even more that you chose to walk away from a very good relationship. I wish you had at least tried because even if we broke up anyway, I know at least you valued what we had. I wouldn't feel as worthless, either.
