ornellians,

Finals week is wearing away on everyone including yours truly. Hence the slow postings as of late. So I've put together a little survey to gauge how the page is currently used, as well as what direction the Mods need to take it. Your feedback will help us continuously improve Cornell Confessions and allow us to post more frequently. Thanks in Advance!

Good luck with finals! Remember, we don't do things because they're easy; we do things because they're hard!

Also, if you're feeling especially overwhelmed this is just a reminder that Cornell University has services such as EARS/CAPS that provide an open and non-judgmental space to work through the host of feelings of stress that come with or are exacerbated by finals week.
