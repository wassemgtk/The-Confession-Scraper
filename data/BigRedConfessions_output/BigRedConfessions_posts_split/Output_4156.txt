"I hate my father and his side of the family. I've been sexually abused by them, been witness to my mother being mocked for her dark skin and educated upbringing, seen my dad nearly pull the hair out of her scalp, and watch as he verbally and physically assaulted her and my younger brothers for about 2 decades. Just two years ago we also found out about his numerous affairs and potential children he had with other women--one of whom he financed and helped move into the neighborhood, literally 2 blocks away from us. On top of dealing with my own depression and flaws, knowing all of this really screwed me up mentally. I wasn't a top-achiever in my engineering class by any means, but I did survive. I've seen by GPA plummet from ~3.3-3.4 in the middle of sophomore year to a truly horrible level. I feel like I've wasted my time here and my mother's money--money she accumulated over nearly 15 years as an immigrant in the healthcare industry. Unfortunately, in addition to my student expenses, we also lost money in a scam by my dad's brothers in which we lost a hefty 6-figure sum that now lines their coffers. This money formed a major chunk of our savings and now there's barely any left for my more talented and smarter brothers to go to school. On top of all this, we're pretty sure my dad's been squandering money on his various mistresses and their kids over the years. Unfortunately for us, the man is also a sociopath. He goes to church every Sunday with his little tribe of brothers and their families and puts on a great show--enough to convince our sexist, patriarchal ethno-religious minority community that he's a good man. His hypocrisy would make Jimmy Swaggart swoon. 
Just recently I found out that he punched her in the face. I feel so helpless. We're tied down to him at the moment due to financial, legal, and social constraints (constraints placed upon us by our very religious and conservative community). He is the definition of a deadbeat. He's used my mother's name to get loans to finance shitty businesses he never paid attention to. As a result, in addition to losing our savings, my mother's name is tied up in 6-figure debt. To add insult to injury, she--the sole breadwinner of the household--lost her job 1.5 years ago and we've just been through hell. Surviving off of her money, my dad's nearly put up a fight every week to force her back into a very difficult industry. In addition to all of this, he continues to date and fuck the neighborhood whore and barely tries to cover it up. 
I have a plan in place to help us get off the ground financially and I've finally begun trying to repair my life. But I don't know if I'll succeed--even if I do, it will be 2 or 3 years before I can fully help and relocate my family. Some nights I go to sleep numbed by all the pain and wondering if there's a God in heaven who hears my desperate plea for help. I know I don't have the right to complain and many others have faced worse situations--drug-addict parents, orphans, war refugees, etc.--the list is endless. Some of these poor souls probably even go to school here. I gather strength from knowing that there are people who came before me who did make it through even worse situations (and that I won't be the last). But man, I'm so scared and so alone. I don't want to fail again and yet failure seems to follow me wherever I go. I need to restore my own dignity, but feel trapped by a cycle of dark thoughts. I see my more successful peers around me and it kills me inside. I can't fail...I just can't...I don't know what I'll do if this story turns out for the worse. It will likely have a cruel and macabre ending in a futile attempt to claim justice in an unjust, unforgiving world. "
