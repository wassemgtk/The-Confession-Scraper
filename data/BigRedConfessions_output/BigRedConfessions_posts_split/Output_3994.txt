"I'm actually really into you but I hate how I act when I'm around you. I keep reverting back to a middle school girl acting awkward as fuckkkkk and not being able to articulate myself.
I know not to put weight on any guy/have too high expectations; if it doesn't work out with one guy, another one will inevitably come along. The sky will not come crashing down if you're not into me. But I get so nervous when I'm around you; it makes me sick. I literally become a bumbling idiot when we're alone, spilling things and tripping over my own two feet. I just hope that you actually can pick up on the fact that I'm more than the sixth grader who couldn't look the boy she like-liked in the eyes. Some might actually go as far as saying I'm smooth. Like buttahhh. 
Like so smooth you can't believe I'm not butter!

k I'm done"
