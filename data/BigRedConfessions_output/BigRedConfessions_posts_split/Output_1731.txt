Reading confessions on here about people being 20-21-year old virgins and thinking that is embarrassing or terrible or exceptional... It's not. I'm a graduate student. I had my first kiss at 26. And I lost my virginity at 30. It's pretty pathetic, no question about it. But I've had a pretty good life nevertheless and since I actively started dating, I've had... plenty of experience. So I don't really think of my 20s as wasted in that regard. I was focused on other things. So don't be alarmed, it's not a big deal at all. That being said, social life and dating is just as important a part of college as studying and working. I wish someone had told me that. The longer you wait, the more it'll weigh on you, so I'd recommend just getting out there and trying your luck sooner rather than later -- it's an integral part of human existence for better or worse and if you deprive yourself of it, you will suffer psychological repercussions, which will carry over to others aspects of your life.

If it's not happening for whatever reason, definitely DO NOT overthink it. And if you think no one wants you, as I did -- you're wrong. You're a virgin because of something you're doing, not because people aren't attracted to you. I thought the latter, and once I actually started trying, I found out a lot of girls liked me. My self esteem is much higher now b/c of that -- you may think that's superficial, but that's just how humans are. Nothing can bring your confidence up like attention from the opposite sex. Dates are an excellent mode of interaction b/c people express interest in each other, so it's mutually beneficial, even if it doesn't lead anywhere. And confidence is one of the most useful things to have, that unfortunately you have to get thru an organic means, you cannot manufacture it in your brain artificially. So get out there and get some attention!
