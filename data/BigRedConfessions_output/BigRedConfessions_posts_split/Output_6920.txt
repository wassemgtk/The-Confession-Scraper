"""The only reason a girl would go to the gym is to lose weight.""

Go away. Seriously? You ever want to consider that maybe I go because I care about my health? Sure, if I lose some weight, great, but honestly that's not the whole point. Consider that maybe I want to get fit and that I want to stop walking up the stairs to Baker and feeling like I want to pass out at the top. Consider that maybe my family has a history of heart disease, and that I'm trying everything I can to prevent a heart bypass surgery before the age of 50 or a heart attack before I'm 30.

Why does everything have to be about how girls look? When I'm feeling down why is the first reassuring thing I hear always ""you're pretty/beautiful"". Tell me I'm smart, or that I'm funny, anything else; I hate living in a society where so much attention is focused on a girl's looks, and reassuring her that average is beautiful seems to be the top concern."
