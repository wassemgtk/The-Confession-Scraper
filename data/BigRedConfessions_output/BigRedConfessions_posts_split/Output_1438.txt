College should be a place and time where you grow professionally and personally. So, stop making a huge fuss when someone makes a change in their life, it's called maturation. If I drop a couple of  " friends," I change my wardrobe, I change my views, I change my career path or do new activities don't EVEN try to put me down because you won't be able to. In fact, I find it quite amusing, but I also pity you, your insecurities are clear as day. 
Anyway, I've got work to do, you see I have dreams and ambitions bigger than you, bigger than this experience. Each day brings me one step closer, and it feels good.
