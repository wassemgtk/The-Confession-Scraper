Single most embarrassing and luckiest thing just happened to me. For reasons I'd rather not go into, I wasn't wearing underwear today. I went to the bathroom and took a leak. I thought I had zipped up my pants. So I left the library to get some lunch and once I was outside some strange sensation came over me...like I was being watched. I looked down and noticed my fly was open!!! I don't know if anyone noticed...but holy cow...I'm lucky my dong wasn't sticking out. I think I just reached a new low...a Homer Simpson low. Damn.
