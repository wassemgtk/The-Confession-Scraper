"Just walked into EARS lobby but it was empty—when I checked, the counseling room was locked. I remembered checking on their website and I was so sure it was still in its regular hours. This was my first time going there so I was unsure what to do. Only a guy sitting there who was apparently doing his homework told me that he hadn't seen anyone there. He said he was sorry. 

I am a very happy and content person but there are simply things I don't understand. I think people are too polite, too afraid to offend, and too eager to please in a tremendously superficial way. I have a lot of friends who are very open to sharing things in their life—everything except their heartfelt desires and shames. This creates an atmosphere in which everyone is both present and absent, both there for you and there to shut you out. I'm not complaining about anything and it's probably my fault, but I just feel this EARS incident represents all things I have experienced in Cornell. This is a civilized society, and coming from another culture I can't say enough how much I appreciate being respected and kindly addressed by strangers, and how much I love being left alone away from the crowd once in a while, but I am deeply disappointed. I told myself when the semester gets busy I'll become just like everybody else and forget about my current whining self."
