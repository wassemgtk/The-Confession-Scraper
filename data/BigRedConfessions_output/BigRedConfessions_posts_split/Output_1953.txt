I was chatting with this girl I met on the Internet and it turns out she works on College Ave in a store that supposedly recently opened and doesn't sell food. The fact that she wouldn't tell me exactly what the store was called had me feeling a little suspicious. So I searched, but didn't find anything. So Cornell peoplez, any helpz to prove that this girl isn't a complete scam?
