I'm not too comfortable yet with sharing my personal experience with mental illness but I will try to share a poem I just wrote that summarizes my experience with anxiety now for three years.

I'm so tired about worrying
about not trusting the words of doctors themselves
that tell me i’m ok
i’m so tired of being afraid
afraid of death
afraid of loss
afraid of change 
i’m so tired
i’m scared to live
i’m scared to die.
