Responding to #5512, for being critical of my preparedness capabilities. I was not criticizing people for not having bunkers, see you are missing the point must have a problem reading a simple paragraph, and just jump to conclusions all of a sudden. I was being critical of those who live in cities, as cities have the potential to be very dangerous....anyways do whatever you wish, it's your life. You can prepare even at school by having a "bug out" bag or something in your dorm or apartment where you store a medical kit and supplies just in case a natural disaster or something more serious were to occur. I worked for a government agency previously that dealt with national security measures and we had to estimate the number of "average joes" that would perish in a disaster, and can tell you that no government agency is looking out for you, unless you take the initiative and prepare no matter how small, yourself.
