Took me three full years to figure out why I have been unhappy. It's not the academic stress of Cornell, it's that I don't have any real friends. I realized tonight that I've only had people here I hang out with sometimes. I realized that for as much as these people know me, they're really just acquaintances. And, in realizing this, I truly see what my problem is. I'm not unhappy, I'm just profoundly lonely.
