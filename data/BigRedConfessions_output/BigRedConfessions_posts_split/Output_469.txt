Louis CK was right in his interview with Conan. Everyday I have a sudden urge to check my phone or plug myself into a computer to be distracted from that ""forever empty"" feeling. It sucks because I'll break out in tears at random moments during the day and play it off as allergies or some nonsense. 
I really hate my life. I wish I was something else besides myself... like nonexistant or a rich person's cat...
