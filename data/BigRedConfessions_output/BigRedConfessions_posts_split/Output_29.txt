Four years ago in high school, a girl who I looked up to called me out as a creep and as annoying in the middle of class (among other insults). It's an event that stuck with me. Now, I'm starting to think she's right. I thought that coming here would be a good place to have a fresh start, to begin anew. For the first couple of years, things were going alright, Now, I've noticed increased hostility towards me, most likely from my own actions. People don't seem to want to hang around me. The same patterns are repeating, like they did four years ago. I know it won't be long before a spark lights the power keg and everything comes crashing down again. I just thought things would be different. I guess not. maybe it's just how I am. No matter what I do, how hard I try, the end result will be the same. She were right. I am a creep. I am someone no one wants to hang around.
