Ann Coulter is my favorite Cornell alumna! She is amazing for speaking up for the conservative causes in this country and taking back this country from the left. I am proud to be a woman attending Cornell, because I hope that one day to be like her, a woman fighting for what she believes in no matter what anyone thinks. I also support Pamela Geller, another distinguished woman on the conservative side. These women are true feminists showing that women can also be involved in politics and make a difference to make America great again! I am like the OP of #6456 who would be bashed by the liberal population at Cornell if any of my non-conservative friends found out my true beliefs. Whoever wrote about Michael Savage in that post you rock and thanks for finally speaking up for the conservative cause! I also like to listen to him and I believe if more people followed his common sense we could take back the country from the cancer that has metastasized and make America great again like Donald Trump said!
