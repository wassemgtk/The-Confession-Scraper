Girls need to respect themselves. How do you expect to find a guy to respect you if you can't even respect yourself? A guy who cheats on you over does not deserve your trust. I have seen so many girls who subject themselves to humiliation because they think the guy is “too” good for them. No. Everyone is valuable in one way or another. You deserve someone who treats you well and in return, you should treat him with integrity and sincerity. A relationship based on lies will not miraculously turn into love.
