Does anyone here know why we have the exhibit in Kroch library? There are always people laughing, talking, and shockingly, noise actually travels in an atrium. How does it even make sense to have exhibits be in a QUIET LIBRARY. And to people who video chat or answer phone calls in the hallway for 30+ minutes - yes, everyone can also hear every word you are saying.
