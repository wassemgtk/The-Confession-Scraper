My best friend and ex-roommate at Cornell had to leave the school. We used to sing and dance to "I really like you" by Carly Rae Jepsen all the time last year in our room. Now that Jepsen is coming to Cornell and she's not here, I miss her more than ever. Wish you were here to see the concert with me, boo. I really really really really really really miss you.
