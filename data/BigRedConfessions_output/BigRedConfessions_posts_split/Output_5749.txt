Unhelpful TAs are the bane of my existence. Seriously, if you're a TA, could you at least try to be helpful and not make me feel stupid every time I come to office hours? It makes me never want to go to office hours no matter how helpful another TA may be. And undergrad TAs, you could try to be a little less condescending. Just because you did really well in the course doesn't mean you can teach or explain the material worth a darn and you aren't better than me because of it.
