There are quite a few confessions that have been posted recently that are VERY applicable to what I have been going through... I'm just hoping that a certain someone out there is not reading them thinking that it's me sending in those confessions. I have too much pride to confess how I truly feel over a confession but I would be more than happy to tell you in person. I think trying to prove myself through this says a lot though...
