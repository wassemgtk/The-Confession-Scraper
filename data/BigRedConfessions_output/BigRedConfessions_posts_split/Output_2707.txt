I am basically in love with a guy who has a girlfriend.  We used to work together (me and the guy) and we got along amazingly.  I feel like he might be staying in his relationship because it is easy.  Or maybe he is crazy in love with his girlfriend.  I don't know.  I just don't want to run into him years from now and tell him I used to have a crush on him and have him tell me that he would have gone out with me if he knew.  What I need is advice.  Should I tell him how I feel or should I move on?  And how does one do either of those things successfully?  I appreciate your understanding because I am just a fairly confused young lady.
