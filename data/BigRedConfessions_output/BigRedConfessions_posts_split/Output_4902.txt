I often pee in the sink and I feel no shame. I'm 6'5" it's essentially a urinal for me. It's just so much easier. I clean up really well afterward, it's actually probably more sanitary than peeing in the bowl where sprinkles will go flying everywhere. I only do it in my own sink, let me make that clear. I don't pee in other people's sinks or public sinks. But only out of respect, I actually think the world would be a better place if everyone peed in the sink.
