I'm a guy and I really like designer clothes. I like to wear Ferragamo, Gucci etc belts/shoes, and overall dress well. But you'd never guess it walking past me, because I'm too afraid to wear any of those things here. No, instead you'll see me in whatever cheap and old stuff I happen to have lying around. I didn't even bring my these things with me.

I'm afraid I'll be ostracized/be spotted around campus and gain a reputation I don't want. That does seem to be a 'thing' here. Also, I'm definitely not gay but I feel like people will make judgements because of the correlation between gay guys and this sort of thing..
