When I was a junior in high school, my then-girlfriend got pregnant and had an abortion. At the time, I told her I'd be supportive no matter what she chose, but I was secretly, selfishly, hoping she would get it. I've felt a lot of shame about the situation ever.

Now we've both graduated college, and she seems well. Cornell's a good school and I have a job lined up, and we're both moving on to the next stages of our lives. But I can't stop wondering if we did the right thing. The pregnancy severely damaged our relationship, and who knows if we could have gone the distance if we made a different decision.
