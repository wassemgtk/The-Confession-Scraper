I give up so much for my friends. I love them and I try to show it by spending time with them. But whenever I suggest something it seems like they shoot me down. I know they care about me but I can't help but feel like they think they are superior than me. They have very similar interests and I feel left out most of the time. I'm sorry I don't understand everything you talk about, that doesn't mean I don't know anything. Please just try and make it seem like you care for me once in a while.
