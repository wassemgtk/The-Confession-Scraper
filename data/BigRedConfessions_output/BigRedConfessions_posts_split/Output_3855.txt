So I'm hot, I'm thin in old shape im cute and my hair is decent length (shoulder) and its real! So why, why are no guys interested in me? I go out on occasion, look cute in the libraries and im always on central campus, but still no biters :/. And when I do go out my friend ALWAYS gets on and she has a bf so she never talks to anyone but I'm always there's going im available (well not saying it- thinking it). What's wrong with me? Why does no one like me? I deserve attention too *sigh* I guess I'll just continue to fade into oblivion ðŸ˜­
