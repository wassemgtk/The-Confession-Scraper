The arrogance of many of the engineering students I know here is hilarious. One has literally told me, to my face, that he or she could do everything I do at Cornell (I'm in Arts & Sciences). No, you fucking can't; You're only taking courses in one field that you are (presumably) interested and excel in. Yes, Engineering does have the "liberal studies" requirement, but it is in no way a liberal arts curriculum, and engineering students are able to use AP credit to fulfill any of these breadth requirements. As an Arts and Sciences student, I am not able to do this, and I can't really use any of the â‰ˆ40 AP credits I have earned. I'm required to take high-level courses (e.g. a 2000+ level language course) across multiple different subjects. 

Regardless of whether I think I could complete the Engineering requirements at Cornell, there is a huge difference between taking all of your courses in the broad field (STEM) or narrow subject that you're strong in, and taking rigorous courses across multiple subjects in addition to your major. Get off your high fucking horse.
