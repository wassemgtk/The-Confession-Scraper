I've finally gotten to a place where I can say I'm happy with myself. As someone who has suffered from low self esteem their whole life, this is such a surreal feeling. I'm content in myself. I feel like I've really grown in the matter of barely a year. I realize that I can look back on all that I've done and take pride in my decisions and have no regrets at all. That's what life is about, right? Living in a way that makes you happy and that leaves you feeling proud and not regretful. Making others happy. Doing the right thing, morally. I still have so much life ahead of me, and I'm going to live it to the fullest because I am fucking awesome, because I am ME, and NOBODY can take that away from me.
