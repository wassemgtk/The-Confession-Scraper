"Overheard loudly on the bus: ""Oh my god, that guy just pushed me. How fucking rude!""

Well, maybe if you weren't standing at the front of the bus, in the middle of the aisle, with your arms outstretched, ignoring all the people in the rain trying to get on the bus saying ""move back, please"" because you're too busy complaining about what a jerk your professor is because he's making you do ACTUAL work at an institution that you're attending by choice, people wouldn't have to push you out of the way to get by.

The sense of entitlement and egotism displayed by students at this school is staggering."
