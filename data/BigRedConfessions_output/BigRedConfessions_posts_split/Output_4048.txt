Cornell University, Code of Conduct, Page 16

""f. To haze another person, REGARDLESS OF THE PERSON'S CONSENT TO PARTICIPATE. Hazing means 
an act that, as an explicit or implicit condition for initiation to, admission into, affiliation 
with, or continued membership in a group or organization, (1) could be seen by a 
reasonable person as endangering the physical health of an individual or as causing mental 
distress to an individual through, for example, humiliating, intimidating, or demeaning 
treatment, (2) destroys or removes public or private property, (3) involves the consumption 
of alcohol or drugs, or the consumption of other substances to excess, or (4) violates any 
University policy""

Hazing is hazing, regardless of whether or not you agree to something you are getting into, no matter how the hazer is trying to justify or convince you that what is happening is not hazing.

One should always approach initiation into organizations with a certain amount of doubt. Always question-and if you are not getting sufficient answers-speak up!! 

Do not fear-for if you are a victim-the university will do all in its power to protect you!
No organization here on this campus can make you feel like you've signed your constitutional rights away. It doesn't matter what documents you've signed or what agreements you've made with the organization-you have the right to defend yourself.

You cannot be stripped of your identity or feel like your identity is threatened in any way, neither can you be stripped of your personal autonomy, and also very importantly-money or personal private property, as these all have great effects on your mental health. 

Just because you aren't physically hurt doesn't mean you haven't been hazed. You cannot be sworn to secrecy.

Please take care of yourselves and others and trust those around you that are obligated to help!!!
