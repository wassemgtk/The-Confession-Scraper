I lost my phone at the slope yesterday at the front left side of the slope and I know somebody picked it up because I was in the same spot the entire time and i searched all around where I was as soon as I realized I lost it.  It's a black iPhone 5 with a black otter box case on it.  The flaps that cover the vibrate/ring switch and the headphone slot are ripped off.  If you found it or have it please either turn it into the cornell police at barton hall or comment on this and we can meet up so it can be returned no questions asked with a 50$ reward. Thanks
