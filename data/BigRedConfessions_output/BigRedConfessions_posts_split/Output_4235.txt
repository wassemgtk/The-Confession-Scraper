"I've been through a sexual harrasement case.

However, I was on the accused end. It's funny to see who comes against you when the JA trial is about to come; the people on the opposing side didn't have ANY direct evidence against me and just wanted to side with the female to tarnish my academic and personal futures. In fact, most on the opposing side were girls, while my side had both boys and girls.

However, I find it the most beautifully ironic that a girl that I had liked, and had spent a ton of my time talking with didn't even offer to vouch for my character. People TALK about sexual harassment, and hope you're DOING WELL, but DON'T KNOW what it truly entails for someone who didn't do anything. You have accusations thrown at you, and people look at you like you're a monster. Someone even called me a pig multiple times, and most of my ""friends"" throughout my freshman semester left.

I tell myself that everything happens for a reason and that I'll become more mature when I'm back.  Keep one or two people extremely close. Be friendly with the rest, but never trust them. People don't understand your dream and can never fulfill anything for you. They can do a lot to work against you though, and for no apparent reason, whether it be out of jealousy or fear. "
