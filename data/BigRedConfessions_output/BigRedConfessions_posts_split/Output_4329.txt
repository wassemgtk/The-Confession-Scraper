There are so many things we take for granted in this world. Our health. Our parents. Our security. Whether or not the phone call or conversation you make with a family member will be the last one. I didn't really understand the phrase "live every moment like it's your last" until a few months ago. But not for my sake: for my mother's. She became ill and I feared she wouldn't make it though, but she did, thankfully. Even though she's much better now, I'm still afraid of losing her. I'm afraid that one day I'll call and she won't pick up. From today, until the end, I'm going to cherish every moment. Every laugh. Every conversation. Every piece of wisdom she has to offer me. We all have to die at some point, but I'm not ready for her to go yet. I'm not sure I ever will be.
