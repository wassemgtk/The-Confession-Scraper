I wrote a post a week or so ago, but it got lost. It doesn't really matter, because this post only reiterates and further confirms what I said: I'm falling deeper and deeper in love with my coworker. I've never had someone understand me so deeply before--and he's just a really awesome person! I honestly think about him pretty often. When a thought pops up in my mind, he's the first person I think about telling this thought to! Because I know he'll get it and laugh about it! Goddamn workplace standards (he's an actual Cornell employee)--if you didn't exist, I would ask you out in an instance. I don't care about feeling shy or awkward about it. I'd invite you to hang out with me. It's not going to happen though...Why!?!?! Oh, contingency, how you frustrate me so.
