At first, I loved the tinder app. It gave me everything I wanted for the year after my relationship ended. All of the fun stuff, none of the drama or the work. But now I hate it with a passion. I have no idea how to meet people anymore, no idea how to make a relationship happen. I don't live in the dorms anymore so I rarely meet new people, and when I do, it's rarely on a regular basis. How are you supposed to find a significant other like this? It feels so impossible to find something more on tinder. I feel like these guys don't want something more. They've gotten everything they want, and none of the work to maintain it, and maybe even a rotation. Why would they want to stick with just one girl! Gah! Boy! I just want to tell you I like you without you running away thinking it's getting too serious. I want this empty feeling in my heart to leave. I want a boy to like the idea of 'us' as much as I do. I want to be wanted for more than just a release. I hate this hookup culture.
