"My fall break made me realize exactly how much I hate Cornell.

People back home were friendly! Incredible, no? They were happy to see me and they said hello and did other nice things like using the manners they were taught. Simply amazing.

There's none of that here. The vast majority of people I've met here were self-centered and completely fucking rude and inconsiderate (the only exception being, not surprisingly, the working-class people I've met). This attitude is so pervasive that I've been better off spending nearly all my time alone, by choice. I've learned nothing here besides how shitty the people here are, and all I will have to show for my ivy league experience is a piece of paper with my name and ""Cornell University"" on it. I'm a senior and I absolutely can't wait to be done with this place. I tried to reach out and make the most of it, I really did. Once I go, I am NEVER looking back."
