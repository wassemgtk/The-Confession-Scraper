All I do is go through social media to see what you are doing spring break. At least I know if you are on your phone you are not having that much fun. I saw you post a picture with another guy and my heart sank. I will never be able to get over you. I feel in love from the first lasagna. I really want to talk to you but I don't want to get in the way of your fun. What we had is in the past and it ended because I was immature and selfish. Now that my life is at an all time low all I think about is you. You were my everything. You were (and still are) the reason I get up in the morning. I'm falling into a deeper and deeper depression because I know my chances of being with you again are decreasing. I might never see you again and that makes me feel awful. I tried to move on but I cannot stop loving you. I just wish I could talk to you...
