I never posted on this before but i feel like I need some way to vent. I am tired of sitting in class surrounded by faces that don't look like mine. I am tired of spending endless hours studying material for exams alone because I do not fit in as an engineer. I am tired of recieving failing grades on exams that I put hours of studying into. I am tired of drowning my sorrow in alcohol because I do not feel comfortable sharing my feelings with my friends. I am tired of waking up everyday with no motivation to do anythig. I feel like I am going through serious depression but i can't tell anyone because I am a man and men are suppose to be "strong". I feel like this may be my last semester here because I am going to fail out. I am so afraid to go back home, where everyone had so much faith in me because I made it out and into an Ivy League school, just to tell them I failed. These past few weeks suicide has been on my mind so often. I know i can not go through with it because it would devastate my mother and brother but I really just wish i could walk away from it all. Do not tell me about how I shouldn't kill myself because I know from first hand experience how much suicide affects those around you, but I can't help that these thoughts come to mind. I need God now more than ever but I feel the least connected with Him at the moment. If you read all this thank you. There was no point to my post, I just needed to tell someone how I feel.
