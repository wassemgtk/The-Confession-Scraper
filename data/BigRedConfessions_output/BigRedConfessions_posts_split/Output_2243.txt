"The herpetology exam I took yesterday was INSANE. It is super discouraging and annoying that I made fair amount of effort in a subject I am passionate about, and it cannot even guarantee me an S grade. 

Somebody should tell them that the way they make exam questions are absolutely unacceptable. The exam is filled with essay questions like ""Explain what blah is""""compare and contrast such and such"", or even letting us retell an anecdote mentioned in class. No learning objectives. No study sheets. No review sessions. So we are supposed to memorize every single word on lecture slides, including those latin names of families/species, and fancy words related to anatomical structures. This is impossible for a non-major, a non-native English speaker, or a graduating senior with little time (all true for me!). They are test-running learning machines instead of evaluating students. 

I learned that the professor's teaching this course for the first time. I wish to do two things: asking them to give me a big hand, and point out that the exam is not fair.  How should I do this two things together without irritating them? (Unfortunately, I've already submitted course evaluation last week)"
