"There's this pretty Indian girl with curly hair that I see around campus sometimes wearing orange earbuds, constantly jamming out to her music. I've listened to her talk and she seems so quirky and exciting and refreshing. Her smile is contagious. I really want to get to know her, but she's constantly surrounded by friends, and the few times that she isn't, I've chickened out and haven't said anything. 

One day, I'll finally get the nerve to ask you what you're listening to. "
