I am so glad I graduated and I have a six figure salary lol. I can finally be away from all the losers at Cornell, who always wanted to "raise taxes on the wealthy to make life more fair." So pretty much you have to tax a hard worker like me, in order to overcome other people's lack of motivation. This is the beautiful U S of A, if you want to work hard you will make it if you don't, I guess you can still be a welfare leech for my money.
