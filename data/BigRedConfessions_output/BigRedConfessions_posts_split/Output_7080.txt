"Every so often, I hear guitar music being played in the room beneath mine.

I don't know who's playing it, but whoever you are, thank you. You're pretty good. Some days, when I hear it drifting up through the halls, it makes me feel way better. I hope your music brings you as much joy as it brings to me."
