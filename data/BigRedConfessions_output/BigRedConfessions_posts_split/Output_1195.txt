I always find it funny when my more accomplished friends complain to me/in front of me about their problems. I really just want to tell them to shut the fuck up, but instead, I hear them out because I don't want to make them more miserable. These are friends that have job offers, are more sociable/likeable than me, and often better looking, and their rants are usually related to one of those three things. I often just want to scream in their faces that I'm JOBLESS, more unattractive than they are, still a virgin despite being a fucking senior, and the cherry on top- shy and awkward. So if anything, I'm more clueless about my life than them and I wish for once that they would take that into consideration.
