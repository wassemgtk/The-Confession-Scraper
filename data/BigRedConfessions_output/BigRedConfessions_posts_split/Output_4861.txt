"It's weird. I spent a few months in Cornell, away from my home country and ever since I came back I feel irritated and more isolated from people.
 
Flaws in the way things are done in my country became very obvious and some things in the way some of my friends treat me started to bother me whereas I didn't even notice those things before.
I also became very attached to the people I met abroad and now that everyone is so far away I've lost contact with some of them and started to question if they even considered me as their friend.
I thought it was just the shock of coming back and it would go away after a while.

Maybe I'm just anxious seeing my friends all ahead of me and graduating, or anxious with not knowing what to do after my own graduation. Then again, maybe not."
