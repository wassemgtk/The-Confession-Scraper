I just reread a song I wrote about you a couple of months back, about what we were, about what you meant to me.
And you don't know. 
Isn't it funny how we don't understand the impact we have on each other's lives? In general, people mean more to others than they'll ever know because the majority of time we don't tell others the impact they've had on us.
This isn't about telling you the impact though; I'm not scared to. I just realize things are done. All I hope is that one day I inspire someone to write something about me. I want to be someone's muse :)
