I wore the same pair of socks and underwear for a month. Now I have crotch rot. Luckily my feet are ok though. The plantar's warts that were once there have now almost dissolved off. Question is...was it the salicylic acid treatment that I applied bi-weekly? Or because they hadn't had too much exposure to air? I may have to take this one to the lab and run an experiment just to find out...
