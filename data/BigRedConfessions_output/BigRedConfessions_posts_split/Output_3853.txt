"To the people who turned a peaceful vigil for Michael Brown into a disruptive protest,

Fuck you very much.

Did you think you were brave? Did you think you were revolutionaries?

Fuck no. All you did was disrupt life for the locals--maybe even some of the same people who serve your asses for nine bucks an hour!

The organizer of that vigil has spent years building community relations with the IPD. Then assholes like you, who are out of here in a few years, go and ruin it.

You wanna talk about privilege? Good. Let's talk about the privilege of people who can be loud, disruptive assholes and leave the repercussions for other people to deal with.

You're upset about racism and police brutality? Awesome, so am I! Let's have a dialogue. Hell, let's have heated debates. If there's one good thing that can come from Micahel Brown's death, it's a national conversation about these important issues.

But you going into town, yelling profanities at police officers who didn't fucking shoot anyone, and holding up traffic for people just trying to get home from work doesn't do shit. It just makes you look like assholes, which, if you think demonstrations like this are good, you are.

In the future, think about the consequences of your actions before acting. And try not to be such fucking assholes.

Sincerely,
Someone who's a little upset with his fellow ""progressives""
