In response to #6450:

I swear it's like I wrote your confession. I am in the exact same boat that you are - 20, just realizing that the "admiration" I've always felt for other women is a little (read, a lot) stronger than that, finally understanding why I've never clicked with a guy despite knowing some really nice ones, and feeling, despite the fact that I know my family and friends would accept me for who I am, still terrified to actually come out. 

I can't give you advice, because I don't know what I'm going to do. I can't reach out to you because this is an anonymous page. But I want you to know that you are not alone, and that you don't have to do this by yourself. Take it one day at a time, and step by step. One thing I've learned while trying to start navigating this process is that it doesn't have to be an avalanche - just move one stone at a time. I hope you find every happiness, and maybe someday we'll cross paths in real life :)
