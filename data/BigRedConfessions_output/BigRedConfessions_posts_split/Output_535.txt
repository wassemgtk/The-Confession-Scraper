Just wanna give a shout out to the alert Route 82 bus driver (at about 4:20 on 2/11) who stopped on a dime and made all of us who were standing up get to know one another pretty well. All in order to avoid hitting a pedestrian who probably wasn't paying attention while crossing at the Thurston Bridge. Hey pedestrian - today is the first day of the rest of your life. Do you realize it could have been your last? LOOK UP AND PAY ATTENTION!!!
