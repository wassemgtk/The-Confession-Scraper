At one point in my life, I really hated being an Asian male. Growing up in a mostly caucasian neighborhood, when people met me for the first time they would always have all these preconceived notions about my personality, my interests, and my identity. I always felt like before I was evaluated as an individual, I had to do everything I could to tear down these stereotypes and prove that I wasn't "just another Asian." I mean I didn't really blame them. The way Asian men are portrayed in Hollywood, as these insane, rude, uncultured, larger-than-life, caricatures of human beings (i.e. Mr.Chow), it would be easy for anyone to adopt these values and viewpoints toward Asian men. And don't get me started on the girls. Girls never even looked my way. I always just felt like a piece of furniture. In the minds of my female peers, I wasn't even a possibility amongst the choices of their suitors. So I could befriend them, but all I could really do was befriend the hell out of them. Whenever the friend I had even mentioned relationships and politely asked me about my love life, I would very bashfully respond of my lack thereof. Now for the guys. Of course wanting guy friends I would attempt to befriend guys but because I was not into playing any sports, watching sports, and doing anything stereotypically masculine, I was excluded and marginalized. I always thought that something was wrong with me and that being Asian was a negative thing. In my mind, if I were the handsome, blonde, blue-eyed, muscular and wealthy caucasian guy that almost every race of girl seemed to absolutely be in love with, all my problems would be gone and I would not have to suffer this incredible pain and marginalization. But coming to college has really helped change my mind. With so many groups based upon the celebration of one's culture, I've finally realized that I need not be mad at myself about something beyond my control and something that wasn't even bad to begin with! I realized that as an Asian-American, I had the advantage of being multi-cultural, multi-lingual, and just overall being a much more open-minded, worldly perspective compared to the average American. In addition, since I am pursuing a career in finance, I realized how much of an advantage it is that I am Asian. With China becoming such an enormous financial power, I will be able to use my cultural similarity to my advantage. Also, after finding a loving girlfriend, I've realized that I really do not lack anything. I am not lesser than anyone. There is nothing wrong with me and that I am perfectly fine just the way I am. I wanted to put this story on here because I know so many other "self-loathing Asians." I just want all of you out there reading this to know that you are enough. (if not more than)
