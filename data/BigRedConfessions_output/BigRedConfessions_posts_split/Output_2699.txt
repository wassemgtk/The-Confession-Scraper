Cornell Greek Life has given me a network of friends I wouldn't have had otherwise. I was extremely homesick and depresses the first semester, the guys in my fraternity helped me adjust. You may not agree with Greek Life, but it does help some people and shouldn't be eradicated because of a couple of idiots who give it a bad name.
