I really like you.  Working with you that summer, I just developed such a strong liking for youâ€¦  It lasts through to this day!  It's not so painful now that I've told you how I feel.  I am actually quite happy about the situation, even though you're still dating that other lady.  I've got my eye out for if another mr. right comes along, but if you're ever single, and I happen to be single at the same time, I know we'd be fucking perfect together.  It's weird how a person can feel such a strong bond to another.  I'm not sure why, but I'm excited for our future.
