I called my mom today because I missed her like hell and I've just been SO homesick lately. We talked for about 20 minutes--and then the conversation started making a turn. She does this thing where she 100% believes in whatever people tell her and then proceed to compare me with people she knows. I told her recently that I scored just average on my prelims, and how I was a little bit disappointed with that but not too terribly upset since I was still trying to get the hang of things with being at Cornell/being a college student... anyways, long story short, she started comparing me to her friend's son who goes to UMich and has a 3.9 GPA and her friend's daughter who went to Georgia State who graduated and has a good paying job now. She just kept telling me how they work so hard, she brags about them, and it makes me feel like she wants them to be her kids or something. (she has never even ONCE bragged about me or even told me that she was proud of me. In fact, she was disappointed that I got into Cornell because she wanted me to get into Harvard or any other one of the 8 Ivies--classic, right?). She then said I was being "too arrogant" and "just dreaming" when I told her I want to go look for an internship for this summer (some of her friends told her that college students HAVE to wait until sophomore year to start looking for internships). The thing is, I didn't even say I'd FIND one, I just told her I wanted to see if I could find one. I know there are Cornell students who were successful in finding an internship their first summer--I don't think it's 100% impossible, as she says it is. 

... Anyways, I feel like I can't please her. Even being at Cornell and doing alright in my classes, meeting lots of new people, living away from home, and even going out of my way to make connections with professors and upperclassmen... I'm not good enough. The thing is, if I HAD gone to UMich, Georgia State University, or any other school that she typically talks about, I KNOW she will then compare me to another student at like... Cornell. I don't think I will ever be for her, and that's just so damn depressing. I've been in a really bad mental place recently and honestly, this conversation just made it worse.

One of my friends have been struggling with depression lately and I told him things get better. Because that's what I personally want to believe--it gives me something to HOPE for. Knowing that there are better and brighter days ahead certainly makes dragging myself through today worthwhile. But even as I say that to myself now, I don't know if I believe it anymore. My mom has certainly made it perfectly clear that I am not--and will never be--good enough for her.
