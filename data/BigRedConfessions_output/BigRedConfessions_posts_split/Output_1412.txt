I'm not sure what, but ever since this last summer, I've felt like something has changed in my life. And its ruining everything I've worked so hard for. I felt it immediately when this semester started. I have little motivation, I'm constantly sad, I feel like I'm pushing my friends away, my GPA that I've worked tirelessly for 5 semester to bring back up is slipping away, and my anxiety is far worse than it has ever been. It feels like I'm slipping back into depression, which I thought I had overcome 5 years ago, even though summer was one of the best times I've had since I first had depression. I have no idea what has happened, and it literally has made me cry that I'm losing parts of my life that I have given up so much for.
