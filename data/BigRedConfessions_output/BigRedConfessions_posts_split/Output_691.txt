I never really made friends or joined cool clubs during O week (no clubs really seemed to interest me), so now I'm finding college to be really isolating and lonely. I know that it takes time and a lot of people go through this, but it still kinda sucks. I also don't live in a dorm, so I can't make friends that way. Any advice on making (close) friends and seeing them regularly? Thanks in advance.
