"Dear ""friend""
Today you said one of the most disturbing things I've ever heard: ""I can't be friends with people who dress a certain way."" As in not the way you dress?
Then you went on to explain how I should tailor my wardrobe because ""why wouldn't you want to look good?""
Fuck you.
Best,
Your ""Friend""
