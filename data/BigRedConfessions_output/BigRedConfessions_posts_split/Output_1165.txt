I cannot help but be hateful toward certain people. Now this is not the kind of hate that actually influences my action; I just keep them at the back of my mind. When I interact with people I use a completely different train of thoughts and reasons. But when I am by myself, I feel the urge to mentally pick on random people around.Pretty sure this is a superiority complex of some kind. I have been telling myself to cut this shit, but it keeps me going in this highly competitive environment. With it, I feel obliged to prove to myself that I can justify my darker thoughts by being the best at what I work in. I fear that if I lose this drive, I have nothing else to keep me going.
