Since everyone seems to be confession about their penis, let make take a crack at it (no pun intended). Mine is an average length but a really messed up shape. It's like a pyramid shape, really thick at the base and then it tapers off. I would kill to have a normal uniformly sized body with a slightly larger head, the way it's supposed to be. But no, it's like a triangle. It's flattened too, not cylindrical. I think that's from prone masturbation which is all I did until I was 18. Then I read how bad it can be for the penis. If anyone out there is doing that -- DON'T!. Alas, the damage has been done. I also have a lot of foreskin and it doesn't retract even when the penis is erect. So honestly, length is not all that matters at all. Having a normally shaped penis is much more important. So be thankful if you have that.
