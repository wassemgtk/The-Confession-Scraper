i eat every meal alone, spend almost every day alone, and dont know anyone in any of my classes. I have like 2 and a half friends i only see on the weekends and sometimes not even then. because my parents are sacrificing to send me here, my relationship with them is strained and we rarely talk and when we do its usually tense. i live in a single and usually spend my time in my room talking to myself. and whats really depressing is that im fine with this. this is my life and ive accepted it.
