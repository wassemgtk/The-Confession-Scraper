To continue receiving your love and attention in return. It happens all the time.
When someone tells you they love you, don't believe them. Believe them when they show you. He has never done that. It sounds like you maybe aren't used to receiving verbal or physical affection or attention and you are taking the fact that you're getting any at all to be iron-clad proof of true love - in reality, he knows exactly what to say to get you to stick around, he doesn't want to let go of the attention and security he gets from your relationship, and so he's doing what he needs to 1) get that and 2) not feel like an asshole.
Again - if he loved you, you'd see it - you wouldn't have to talk yourself into it or take everything a liar says at face value in order to convince yourself of it.
