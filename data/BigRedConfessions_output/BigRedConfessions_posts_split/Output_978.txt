I love you, but I can't tell you. Because I know you doesn't feel the same way. Guess I'm just not perfect enough for you.

I constantly look back to the times we spent together. The cuddles and jokes. The arm you wrapped around me. The gentle care. Maybe it doesn't mean much to you, just two friends hanging out. But it means the world to me.
Remember the time when we said goodbye. I smiled and waved, and turned around and cried silently. Because I hope those few days had lasted forever. Yes we will still see each other around, but it would not have been the same. 
I wish you forever happy and young, like the guy I hopelessly fall in love with that winter. I wish you would one day meet a girl you love. I wish you would take her on adventures, skiing or visiting museums, walking along the gorges of Ithaca on a bright winter day, just like we used to do. I wish you would kiss her at that moment, just like what I hoped you would do, but never did.

And I wish one day, I would learn how to quit you.
