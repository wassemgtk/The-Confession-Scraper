I used to be very overweight and had no idea how to use makeup or assemble a nice outfit. I was hyperfocused on living inside my mind and ignored my body for various reasons. Now that I've learned to treat my body with kindness and have been getting much better with makeup, hair styling, etc., I am startled by the number of men who look at me as I walk by. I like feeling sexy but I'm actually rather distributed and depressed by another observation: people at work seem to take me more seriously now. Perhaps it is a combination of a new sense of confidence along with my appearance...but the thought that my mind has always been the same yet people treat my ideas differently because of how I look is rather discouraging. 

I guess I just want to put that hard truth out there and tell everyone to try to look past appearance but also take advantage of the fact that people will always be biased - consciously or subconsciously - and judge you because that's just part of what we do as a cultural and who we are as a species.  Human beings are strange creatures. It sucks but don't ignore it to your own detriment.
