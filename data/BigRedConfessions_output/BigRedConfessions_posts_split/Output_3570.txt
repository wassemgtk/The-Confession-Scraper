"I'm not going to be able to see you tomorrow. I want to put all that I can into this new relationship which means not spending time with exes and making him jealous."
This is the text my boyfriend of 1 1/2 years sent to both break up with me and tell me he's in a new relationship. A f*cking text... wtf...
