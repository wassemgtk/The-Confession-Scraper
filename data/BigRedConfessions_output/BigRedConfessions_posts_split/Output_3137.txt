My long term ex-boyfriend broke up with me a few months ago and I honestly felt like everything was crashing down around me. I was already suffering through depression and it was only exacerbated by the break-up. I experienced suicidal thoughts for the first time in life. I spent hours in bed crying and staring at my window. I went to EARs and I confided in my friends and I went to the gym but I still felt incredibly empty. If any of you have ever gone through a painful experience, then you probably know what I am describing. It is a numbing pain that will not leave, even if you do all the right things. But now, a few months later, I feel so happy and excited about life. I never thought I would get here. I was prepared for the worst semester of my life but I just feel so happy about where I am in life. I see so many depressing posts on Cornell Confessions and on Yik Yak and I wish I could take away their pain. Whatever you are going through, please remember that there is light at the end of the tunnel. Please remember that there are people willing to listen and there are people who care about you.
