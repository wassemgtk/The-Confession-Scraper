Just to echo #6963 & #6934 and to join in the I love BRMB craze, yet another freshman bandie confession:

Dropping by at the BRMB audition during orientation week is one of the best decision I’ve ever made.

I’ve always have some slight issues of low self-confidence and social anxiety. When I first came to Cornell, I was worried if I’m gonna make friends and where I can belong. Never have I expected to find a place in Cornell where I can feel so much love and support as I now have in band. BRMB is more than a club, it is a big family. It’s where you can go to when you had a really shitty day and just want to cry, when you are homesick and need some hugs, and when you receive such great scores in a prelim that you are desperate to tell your friends (speaking from personal experience). It’s the spirit when you are more than willing to walk 30-minutes to rehearsal when it’s 40 degree outside. To this day I can’t believe how lucky I am to be accepted in such a caring community.

Many times I find myself singing along the chimes of evening song coming from the clock tower. When we shout out during NCFS “we are the best in the ivy league,” I truly feel that I am proud of being a Cornelian, and furthermore, I am proud of being a part of the Big Red marching band. 

Thank you band. I can't possibly imagine my college life without you.

 

Also, since it’s anonymous I might as well say it lol:

I have a secret crush on a senior in my section. I wish him a bright future and I’ll really really miss him.
