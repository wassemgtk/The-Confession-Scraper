I have never had a real friend. I don't understand why. I'm perfectly social, I have tons of acquaintances. But I don't know how to make the jump to friends. I never have people text me just because, or ask me to dinner or to hang out. I thought college would be different. I've tried being the initiator and asking people to meet up, but they always have some excuse. It must just be me. I don't know how to change it. I just feel worthless.
