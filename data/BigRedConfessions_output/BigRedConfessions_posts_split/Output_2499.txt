I think there's a middle ground between what post 5538 said and what black rights movement advocates are working for. I'm kind of tired too of hearing things like "yeah FUCK white people"  -- and even though I'm not white, it's just tiring to see minorities, and particularly blacks think that they are entitled to be racist, just because someone else was racist first. I'm all for the black rights movement but can we please do it in a way that empowers black people instead of trying to drag everyone else down? Don't make it a war between black people and white people, because that is exactly what reaffirms underlying racist beliefs and stereotypes. You're being intellectually dishonest if you think that you're allowed to beat down on white people under the flag of "anti-racism", while they can't even judge you because that's "racism".
