I miss my 486 DX 33MHz 8MB RAM 200MB HDD PC from 1990. That machine was tough as nails and it gave me some great childhood memories. I got dial-up internet for it in 1994. Had to install Windows 95 for that... which took like 5 minutes to load and ran really slowly. But I could then email people anywhere in the world and look up anything on - Yahoo or Altavista - using Internet Explorer 1.0 - and and that was mind-blowing. Good times.... Good times....
