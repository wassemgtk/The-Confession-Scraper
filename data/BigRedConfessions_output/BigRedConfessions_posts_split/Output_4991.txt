I just want to let you know, I'm coming for you come August. I haven't been able to stop thinking about you and the last time we were together. It sucks that we finally acted on our feelings at the end of the semester when we'd be so far apart for the summer, but that's all moot now. Another month and I can finally see what happens, because I do feel like you get it, that's there's this mutual connection, that I don't have to strive to keep up a facade. And maybe, nothing will happen. Maybe I shouldn't get my hopes or expectations up. But on the other hand, I've spent the summer learning to love myself and conquering my fears and at least now I know that I'm worth the love and respect I've been pushing away.
