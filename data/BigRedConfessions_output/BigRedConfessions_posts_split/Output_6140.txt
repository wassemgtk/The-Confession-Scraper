I've been giving a lot of thought lately to how I'm going to kill myself, and I think I'll do it at night by climbing onto the net and jumping into the gorge. I've been telling friends and my psychiatrist that I'll get help if I'm ever suicidal, but it's mostly just wishful thinking. My bluntness about suicide scares me sometimes, but I've long since come to terms with the fact that I'm going to die someday. My apologies to my loved ones.
