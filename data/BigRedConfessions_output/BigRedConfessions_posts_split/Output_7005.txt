"To the guy who stopped and asked if I was okay when I was sitting on the steps of Donlon Saturday night, thank you. 
I was perfectly fine, but just knowing people like you exist makes me happy. 
I really hope I see you around so I can thank you in person, but I kinda don't remember your face?
If you see me, don't hesitate to remind me who you are! You seem awesome!"
