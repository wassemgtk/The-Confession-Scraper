To the freshman who is partially bald (and I'm really sorry that's how I have to define you, I just don't know much else about you!!) I have had a crush on you all year. I just think you're so attractive, but I have no idea how to approach you! Wouldn't it be weird if a complete stranger (we've never talked or anything) just asked you to coffee out of the blue?
