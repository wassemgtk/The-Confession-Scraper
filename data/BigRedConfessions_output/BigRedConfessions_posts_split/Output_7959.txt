ou gave me a taste of my own medicine and I can't even complain or be mad at you. I deserve this. Gosh, it must have sucked feeling ignored/put on the back burner. What I did to you I actually do to a lot of guys and I guess I never think that it might actually hurt them because I'm just so concerned about myself getting hurt. What's different about this situation is that even though I've felt bad about what I did to those guys, I sincerely wanted to make amends this time around. One thing I learned from this situation is to be upfront about my feelings. It might have seemed like I was playing a game or that I couldn't make up my mind or maybe even that I was certifiably crazy haha but there were things going on beneath the surface. I shouldn't have been presumptuous in thinking it could work after I was so aloof. I think all too often we do this, being unappreciative of what we have when we have it. And yeah, maybe part of the draw to you now is that you pulled back, which is not a good enough reason to like someone. But you do have good qualities and I should have appreciated what you had to offer when I had the chance. But I will do things differently next time around.
