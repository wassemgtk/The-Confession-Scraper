Movies need to STOP perpetuating the idea that guys who are persistent and try to get the girl regardless of anything, including her clearly showing she is not interested, is not only a good thing, but something that is generally rewarded and results in a romantic relationship. NO -- in the real world that's called stalking and in 90% of the time if you did what guys do in those movies you will get in trouble, probably freak her out and make her feel uncomfortable. I feel like all of those movies are made by middle aged ugly Hollywood directors who are living out their fantasies or justifying creepy things they/men do - same reason why you see relationships where the guy is like 15 years older and considerably uglier than the girl. For the record, I'm a guy. I just hate how brazenly false the image of romance portrayed in popular culture is. I am getting my heart broken from unrequited love and your stupid songs and movies are not helping at all.
