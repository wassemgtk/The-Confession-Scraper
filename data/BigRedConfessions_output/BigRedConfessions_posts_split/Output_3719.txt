Sorry I keep disappearing on you. I just have no idea what you think of me and it's the scariest feeling. I've been trying not to make a fool of myself but I've failed, again. You said lets stay friends but I'm not so sure how you define that. I just want to spend my time with you because I feel so comfortable. Let's see each other soon, please?
