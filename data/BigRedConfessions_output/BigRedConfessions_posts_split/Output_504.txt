I have to admit, being a Conservative in Ithaca was hard, but living there provided lots of benefits. I have to say that liberals have some good things going for them. For instance, many liberals are not religious and believe that they need to make the most of life since there is no afterlife. This makes liberal areas quite interesting in terms of food choices and usually where the liberal quotient is high there is usually great food like in Ithaca or Williamsburgh or DUMBO or SOHO or TRIBECA or Hell's Kitchen or Astoria, NYC (Yeah I know ya hipsters spell it Willamsburg, but I come from a different generation of the grimy, old NYC where we spelled it with an h at the end). Even SF is great, with lots of choices of food and also why my favorite talk show host Michael Savage, a staunch conservative lives there and enjoys the Italian cuisine. I love trying new restaurants and really good local liquors, wines, and ales, unlike more conservative places where I am now living in Pennsylvania which suck when it comes to restaurants. Liberals tend to believe they need to enjoy every moment of life for pleasure, food, sex, drugs, alcohol, and entertainment. This is why I conclude liberal music isn't that bad either, and most liberals make far better food and music than conservatives will ever make. But anyways, I can enjoy the best of both worlds and be Conservative and have good food too, knowing that when I die I will reach the Kingdom of Heaven and enjoy even better food than I had on earth. :) P.S. I love Chicken Sag from Sangam or Diamond's. If you HAVEN'T, TRY IT!
