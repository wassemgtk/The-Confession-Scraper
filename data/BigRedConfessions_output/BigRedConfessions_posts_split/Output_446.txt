Things made between the late 1920's-50's were made very well when America had a mighty industrial force. The things did not sacrifice material and were made with such redundancy that they last to today. For instance ball bearings (hard to find any made in the USA anymore) were so over engineered that that they last to this day in electrical motors. The Cornell Drinking Water plant used to have massive 3-phase electric motors made in the USA and they lasted from the late 20's when the plant was built until just a few years back when they were replaced with imports. The imports crap out all the time because the bearings in them are crap. What I'm trying to get at is planned obsolesce is rampant in our disposable society. Women are disposable for men are so are things for everyone. We don't buy or build things to last forever anymore. We don't appreciate the little things in life anymore and care more about sex than a long-lasting relationship. Even the buildings built in the Art Deco era have over-engineered steel bridge plate beams most likely from the beautiful Bethlehem Steel plant in Allentown (such as those in Kimball Hall) that are not seen in "disposable" buildings that are only meant to least 50 years these days. When they rebuilt the interior of Kimball, they kept the original beams and everything because they were over-engineered and designed so well by American union workers in Pennsylvania. Folks, they don't build anymore like they used to. Our forefathers are amazing people and they built this country to be a great place which is why their buildings are proving to the testament of time.
