My dad and mom live in China. They always tell me to search husband in Cornell, but i'm a lesbian and so frightening to tell them.  Today in the morning I talk to them on skype. It was the same thing. I was so damn sick of it all, so i just told them.  After they cried my mom told me marry a wife to not get lonely when I am an old woman. I did not expect this. I always cry to think about this.
