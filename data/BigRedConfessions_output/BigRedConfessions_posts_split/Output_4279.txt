When I was little, my brother told me I was adopted and that I was descended from a race of people called Saiyans. He said DragonBall Z was actually a heroic epic about my legendary race--on par with the likes of The Odyssey and The Iliad. I was only 5 at the time, but I believed him. I even tried to turn Super Saiyan a few times. It never worked. My mom thought I was constipated for two weeks and eventually she found out and grounded my brother. But to this day I still try to go Super Saiyan when I'm feeling really emotional. Yesterday I think I saw a few of the hairs on my neckbeard turn yellow. Hope springs eternal y'all!
