you have been on my mind so much.. gosh.
i keep telling myself that i am not good enough for you and not smart enough
you are in med school and i know yo have met girls who are smart and beautiful;so why in the world would you even bother to consider someone who doesnt even know what she wants or is scared that she may not even get what she wants?
Gahhhh.
Good luck. 
You will always be the one for me.
