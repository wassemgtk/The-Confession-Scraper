"Walking back home last night, a drunk guy with his friends yelled at me about putting his dick in my mouth. After I ignored him, he and his friends proceeded to scream how ugly I was and other profanities at me....Seriously? Why is there nothing at Cornell to actually EDUCATE guys about sexually harassing girls, both verbally and physically? Why is there no program, at events like orientation and pledging, about teaching boys not to be horny assholes and for girls to stop pretending to want sex when all they actually want is attention?? With all the rapes that have happened - there is still no system by which we can report sexual harassment. If there was a penal system for guys, they would definitely stop harassing girls as readily.

Oh, cry me a river with the argument that guys have it hard in terms of societal pressures on being successful with girls - but that does not justify you sexually harassing us. The shit that comes out of your mouths can be traumatizing. And in turn, ladies - stop making it hard for other girls by thinking it's okay to be a tease. There's a difference between flirting and teasing. All that does is give boys the wrong ideas about girls in general. Also, ladies - word of advice - before you commit to a man, make sure you see him when he's drunk - then you'll know how much of an asshole he actually is with his guard down."
