"This past year I've become such a cold person. I started only seeing the bad in people, Ive made hateful comments and acted like I was somehow ""above"" others. I've literally responded to simple hellos from other people with ""please stop talking"". My friends even laughed along and that made me feel like it was alright.

The past year i've been more depressed than I ever have been and by acting like a total asshole, I was able to actually hide that fact from myself because it let me think I was better. I've had many many successes this year but I've had no one to share them with and that has made me sad.

I have begun to remember where I came from, and I have learned that success means thave nothing can be below you. If you are CEO of a major firm, you should still be picking up garbage in the lobby when you see it. I have begun to love others again. I have begun to love myself again, and not in a cocky way. I have begun to remember who I was before all of this stress, insecurity and the thirst to ""be the best at all costs"" set in.

Im sorry this is so long, but i'd just like to apologize for all the hate. I guess if this were mean girls i'd be the one who is overly emotional and said they ""just had alot of feelings"". 

All I can do now is just start the love back up. I love you Cornell."
