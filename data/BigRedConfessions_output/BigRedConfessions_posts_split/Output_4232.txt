My spouse is moving away unexpectedly after he quit his grad program due to lack of funding despite his incredibly high GPA and incredible commitment to his program. We just can't afford the debt on a degree the median income for which will not allow us to pay back the debt easily while dealing with my undergrad debt as well and helping my impoverished in-laws as they age. We were counting on a scholarship but the money was re-allocated because the department is struggling and the application is just outdated bullshit on the admissions website. My spouse hasn't been able to find a job for several months and I can't afford to pay his student loans and take care of us on just my fellowship. I will be alone here for several years while he is with his family on the other side of the continent. My parents are dead and I have few friends here so I worry about how my life will proceed now that I have so little here for me. I find myself idealizing about jumping into the gorges and stop myself after realizing that, even if I could afford a life insurance policy, it would be voided if I committed suicide. I wish I had never come here. The educational opportunity for me is not worth the horrific stress that has been brought upon my spouse and me by being in an isolated area with no other opportunities. So many people who I mentor here and back at home who are struggling with financial and educational disadvantages look up to me so I'm afraid to quit my program but it now seems like that is an option I need to consider. I hate all of my options and have lost the ability to think strategically because I am so emotional. I think I'm giving up.
