I know I'm not a very attractive girl...and I'm ok with it. I just feel like being colored makes it so much more tough to meet someone. I know this comment may not be taken good but I wish I were white sometimes. White girls meet guys so much more easily. I never felt a problem with my skin color before & never thought of myself as any different. Since I've come to cornell it's just so much more clear to me that white girls are just seen as more pretty. An average white girl is considered prettier than a stunning colored girl. Confirmation? Every single guy I've been interested in and all of my male friends. It's ok to feel more attracted to another race...it just hurts sometimes to know that I'll always be considered second class and I'll never be able to change that. It makes me feel so...worthless and degraded... I don't even bother talking to white guys I'm interested in because..in all seriousness.. which white guy would choose an indian girl over a white girl? It just feels like I always have been & always be the second choice :(
