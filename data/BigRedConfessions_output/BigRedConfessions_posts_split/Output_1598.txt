My romantic connection with you is more passionate than any I've ever had. However, you are so different from me both culturally and religiously that I am hesitant to pursue it further. It saddens me to think of the strong possibility that our families and friends wouldn't approve.
 
But, to be honest, I am tired of trying to find someone who is as deep in the faith as I am. I am consistently treated as a pariah by many in the community for drinking alcohol, and for this same reason many religious girls I have pursued haven't even given me a chance (they told me this was their reason outright). I have a very strong faith so I would've preferred someone I could share it with, but life is just the way it is sometimes. 

Overall, maybe I should just throw caution to the wind and give you a chance. Because when everything goes wrong, you are the only one still there.
