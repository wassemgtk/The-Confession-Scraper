"I miss being out west in Arizona and Nevada and driving my 2016 Corvette which I got as an early graduation gift. I made a promise to my myself that once I graduate Cornell in December I would go on a road trip with my beautiful girlfriend on Route 66 from New York to Illinois to California. Now's the time to enjoy life once and for all. I miss the Art Deco-style Hoover Dam and the old Wigwam motels and the old Phillips 66 gas stations. I also miss the neon lights and the beautiful Milk-way filled desert night skies and the Saguaro cactuses. I cannot wait to go to Winslow, Arizona again listening to my favorite song Take it Easy by the Eagles: 
Well, I'm a standing on a corner 
in Winslow, Arizona 
and such a fine sight to see 
It's a girl, my Lord, in a flatbed Ford, 
slowin' down to take a look at me. 
I am now going to enjoy a few good weeks for myself and my gf until I have to start my job....... B| B| B| "
