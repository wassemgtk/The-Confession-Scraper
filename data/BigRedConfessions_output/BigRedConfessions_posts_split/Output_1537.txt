I love Cornell, but sometimes I feel like the biggest lesson we're learning here is how to cheat the system. I never have time to do all of the reading for each of my classes, much less analyze and distill it with care. As such, I'm not embedding very much of the material, or engaging with it to the degree that I feel we should.

I feel like I'm gleaning useful knowledge here and there, but for the most part it's cramming for what you think will be on the prelim without gaining a full understanding of it. It's learning how to write papers that sound intelligent and cohesive, despite that your research was slipshod and you had to write all 15 pages of it in 2 days.

I feel like any real education in my field is only going to happen after I graduate, and I actually have time to study concepts in-depth.
