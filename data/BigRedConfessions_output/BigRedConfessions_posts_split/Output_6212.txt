I have a crush on my female TA ... but I'm too awkward to do anything about it. She seems to be a bit of a loner, so it just makes me want to approach her more because I feel like we could have a lot of fun, even just as friends. I'd love to ask her what video games she plays so we could play all night (; Pity my gaydar is terrible.
