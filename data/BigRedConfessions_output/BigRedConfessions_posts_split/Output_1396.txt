I like to buy a few pumpkins every year and fill them up with tannerite and shoot them. It makes for a fun explosion. Once I blew up an old shed I found on my large property just for fun. Life is sweet. I wish I was home for Halloween this year. :( I would have bought a Giant Atlantic Pumpkin and lots of tannerite just to blow it up.
