"I think people here hate me. I don't have any close friends here and I've had 3 ""friends"" just stop talking to me abruptly for no reason, just this semester. I have never once been contacted by a friend to hang out; I'm the one who always has to ask. It would be easier to deal with this if I had a girlfriend, but girls don't even give me the time of day.

At first I thought it was because of me, but I still have great relationships with my friends back home even after almost 4 years in college. Sometimes I think East Coast people are just jerks."
