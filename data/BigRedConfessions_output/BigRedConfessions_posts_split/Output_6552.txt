If I could go back in time, I would go back to when I was 18 and BEAT THE LIVING CRAP OUT OF ME. Then I'd do it again the next day and the next until I started doing things right. Those of you who are undergrads - don't waste your early 20s. I know it's hard when you're that young to really see cause and effect patterns, but trust me -- to say this is the most important time of your lives is a HUGE understatement. Don't waste it!!! For the sake of the rest of us, make the best of it PLEASE!
