Why is it so hard for me to be logical? When I know consequences, why do I listen to impulse and my emotions? Why do I take such stupid risks, telling myself that "this time it's logical and rational" and "all signs point to it working out this time"? After all, doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results is called insanity. Why is this such a hard concept for me to grasp? I know that it's logical to trust logic yet I continue to go by emotions and feelings and gut instincts. What the fuck is wrong with me?
