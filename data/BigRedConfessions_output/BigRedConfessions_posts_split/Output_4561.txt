I think I am about to get in a relationship with someone suffering form depression. I know things will be incredibly rough. It is very likely not going to work out. And I probably will end up getting very hurt. Yet I know he doesn't want it to be this way. Depression is beyond his control. He is still an amazingly smart, sweet, kind and romantic person. The good days are going to be the best days I can ever imagine, though the bad days are going to be the rock bottom of my time. I really want us to get through this. Wish me luck, people!
