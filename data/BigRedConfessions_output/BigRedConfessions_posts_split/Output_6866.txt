This site genuinely pisses me off. Rather than post about having feelings for a random and hoping that out of the 30,000 people at Cornell she sees this post, how about you grow a pair and talk to her? A wise man once said "You're going to miss 100% of the shots you don't take." Well, right now you're not taking any shots. If you like this girl, go talk to her.
