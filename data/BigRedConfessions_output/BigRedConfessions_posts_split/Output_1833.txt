To be honest, I have never been a completely happy person. I have always felt that I am missing something so fundamental, yet I never seem to find quite what it is.

Maybe it is purely coincidence, but I have never held a true relationship either. It seems that every girl I am friends with, I am either the ""gay best friend"" or else I am that weird nerd guy. One time, I was in a 'relationship,' but only in the weakest sense of the work. I keep hoping, praying even, that I will find someone that I click with, but I seem to be foiled at every turn. My friends make fun of me for it occasionally, and I laugh along (it doesn't bother me much), but there is a part that makes me wonder if there is that missing piece out there.

I have come to terms with the fact that maybe I am just not build for a relationship, but it saddens me. I always try to help others. I always try to make others laugh and smile. I always try to brighten the mood of any given place. Maybe I have too much ego. Maybe I just don't have the confidence. Maybe a whole pile of issues.

Still, why, can't it be me? Why can't I be the fool with the hands held with my best friend, confidante, and partner as we stride across Ho Plaza, not caring about what others think?
I guess there is something about me that doesn't quite work for all of that. Maybe I will figure it out eventually...
