"ahhh! I can't do this anymore! I want to be with you yet am invisible to you!! I have always felt like i do not deserve to be here and that I am not smart for you. Other girls here are so smart and way prettier than I am, I know you have hooked up with a few. This kills me everytime i repeat that in my head. I just hope that one day you realize that you have a girl here that not only sincerely cares about you but will do anything for you. Not like the other girls who just want to be with you just 'because' or because want some booze. I truly wish that i can get you out of my head and just block you from my mind. 
You are all I ever wanted and more, but you are just an a*** who mainly, i guess, wants to get laid. If that is so, you are not getting that from me. I believe in waiting for marriage and all that BS, so while you have been effing up every easy blonde here, i know that what i would provide will be much, much more than that.
ahh.
