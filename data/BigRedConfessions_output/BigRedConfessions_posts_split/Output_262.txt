After graduating Cornell, I now work at a government agency and I have to deal with some of the dumbest people in the world. I am surprised that some of these people are alive and breathing because their IQ levels are so low. I try my best to help them, but they are wrong and try to accuse me of giving them wrong information, because they don't like to hear what I have to tell them. I go by the book with everything and they wish that I bend the rules for them. It's rather sad how much entitlement I see among those people who deserve nothing.
