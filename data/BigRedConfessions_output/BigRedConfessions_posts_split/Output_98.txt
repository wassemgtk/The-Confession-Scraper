I think I am a grandfather mentally. I must be the oldest student at Cornell when it comes to beliefs and values. I think America was better in the 1930's-1950's. I believe things made back then were built much better which less planned obsolesce. America was a massive industrial power where people had good paying manufacturing jobs, especially under the Eisenhower era. I think people were much nicer back then too. I'm glad when I meet people who have the same ideals as I do. It's a shame most students at Cornell disregard the times when the chrome was thick and the women were great! Those were the days.....
