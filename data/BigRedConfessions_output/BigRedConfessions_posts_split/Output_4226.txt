"What the fuck is wrong with me?

I'm twenty years old, and I've never kissed a girl. I've never had a girlfriend, I've never even gone on a date. I'm not especially socially awkward, I'm comfortable around women, I'm straight... Heck, I like to think that I can be kind of charming when I want to.

But something's obviously gone wrong. And I can't figure out what the hell it is.

I've never even flirted with anyone. What am I doing? I'm panicking now, I'm years, even a decade behind. And thinking like this is tearing me apart, from the inside out.

Maybe I'll be alone forever.
