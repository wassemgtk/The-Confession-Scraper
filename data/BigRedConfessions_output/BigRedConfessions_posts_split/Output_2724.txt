I really actually like Cornell. It can be miserable during the winter (which is most of the year), but I truly feel like I'll be able to handle anything once I graduate from here. It has made me a much stronger person. Not having close friends and being depressed sucks, but I know that if I can make it through an Ithaca winter with this amount of work, without close friends to lean on, I can make it through most anything.
