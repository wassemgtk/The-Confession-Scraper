There is this girl who lives in my building, and she is absolutely stunning. I always see her in the dining hall and she is always looking at me. She seems like the sweetest girl ever. I know she wants me to talk to her, but I haven't been able to bring myself to do it. Its been like this for months. Now it is almost break and I feel like I'm running out of time. All of my friends know I like her and we laugh about how nervous she makes me. But seriously, it drives me crazy knowing she lives so close and there is nothing I can do about it until i actually talk to her and break the ice.
