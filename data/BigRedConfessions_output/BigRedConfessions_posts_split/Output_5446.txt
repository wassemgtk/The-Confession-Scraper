To the beautiful, caramel-color skinned guy who works at CTB: you make spending money on overpriced sandwiches worthwhile. I go every saturday morning just to watch you move your amazing physique and smile that crooked smile. You work harder than anyone else there: good work ethic turns me on. My friends and I swoon whenever you serve us our Autumn Skys, or simply walk by (you smell amazing). Do you go to Cornell? If you do, please, PLEASE sit on my face.
