I'm a 20 year old female and after questioning myself and reflecting I've come to the realization that I'm gay. I've had relationships with men before, men who were wonderful and kind, but I never felt like It was really going anywhere. I have not some out to anyone yet because and I don't have any LGBTQ+ to talk to or know of anywhere to meet people that wouldn't be super awkward.
