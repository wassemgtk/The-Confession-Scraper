It is completely and utterly apparent that this campus is conducive of depression and anxiety issues. 
I am depressed. My roommate is depressed. My girlfriend is depressed. Most of my friends continually joke about offing themselves. We cannot keep living this way.
This is not something i have seen at any other campus. Not enough is being done. I call on President Garrett to make a a more direct effort against this. Our strength can only be whittled so thin.
