"Theres been something that has been bothering me lately... and sometimes one feels like pouring his/her heart out. Please bear with me.

I recently asked my dream girl out, with a view to marrying her soon. She gave me so so so so so many signals that I thought there was no way this wouldn't work but... but it didn't work out. She rejected me. I'm heartbroken. This is different to a heartbreak at 16 or 18 years of age. I'm 24 now. This was serious. I feel so empty these days. I feel completely lost, with no idea of where to go next or what to do. 

Moral of the story: 
1. Don't worry about stupid heartbreaks at an age where they really don't matter in the grand scheme of things.
2. Girls may give lots of COMPLETELY OBVIOUS hints... but until they say it, don't believe any hints.
