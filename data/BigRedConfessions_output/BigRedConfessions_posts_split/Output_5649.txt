I wonder if half of the people dropping all these "missed connections" type confessions realize that, assuming the confessor and object of confession weren't already friends, if the person in question found out that someone in the room they were in wrote an anonymous post about them that they'd be either flattered or creeped out. It's waaaay more telling if you just forgo the ambiguity of technology and talk to them in person. 
They're busy studying/ on Facebook, you say? 
Write a note and leave it on their desk! (okay that's terrible advice) but I think you get my point?
