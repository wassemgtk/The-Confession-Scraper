I am so embarrassed when professors ask point blank questions and the room is filled with silence. This isn't something that happens only now and then but quite often. Why are people so afraid of raising their hands and speaking up in class? It comes off as disrespectful. We're Cornell students for fuck sake. Let's act like it!
