Not working is so much better than working. You have so much more time. I don't feel fulfilled by work and I don't feel like I have a life because I have a job. I have no time for anything but work, eat, sleep. The world offers so much and I can't do any of it now. But then that stuff costs money and I can't get the money unless I work. So... what's the point.
