I feel like crap because I realized I hated my life for going to Cornell. Everyone here was so stuck up. I wish I had gone to Liberty University in Virginia. That would have been a conservative school and it would have been easier to find a girl friend whom I could marry and live a Christian way of life with. :'( Plus they let people carry in dorms and even provide free classes through their own police department encouraging systems to conceal carry and get a Virginia concealed carry permit.
