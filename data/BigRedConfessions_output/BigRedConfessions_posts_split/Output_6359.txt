I see a lot of Christians hating on things they don't agree with online. Like on Humans of NY (which is awesome!) there are always a ton of Christians writing hateful posts whenever LGBT/abortion/etc is mentioned. I'm a Christian myself, and I'm always like "pfff, you're not Christians! Jesus loved everybody, all you do is hate!"
