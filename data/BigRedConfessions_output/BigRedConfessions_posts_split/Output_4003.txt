Having been raised in a racist household, I've found it very difficult to fight my prejudices. Although I would never openly say or do anything to hurt my friends of different ethnicities and colors, I know...I feel that there's a monster lurking in my subconscious. It's hard to explain this in words..I love all of my friends and really don't wish any of them or any person of any other race any harm. But at the same time I find myself thinking certain thoughts, feeling certain emotions when I'm put in a sticky situation. I guess the best example of one case would be when I see interracial couples: i.e. a white guy with a girl of "my race". I have no clue why, but it bothers me when I see these pairings, even though there are two or three in my own extended family. As stupid and immature as it sounds, I feel like that guy "stole" a precious sister of my race. I ask myself "Why is SHE with HIM?" and I go out of my way trying to analyze the situation and I come up with some bogus reasoning that she's trying to "marry up" the social ladder, even though in all realness love can happen between the unlikeliest of people in the unlikeliest of situations. I end up feeling like someone punched me in the gut and I feel weak and uneasy for sometime afterwards. I know I feel this way because my parents would often say things like that against interracial couples when I was a child growing up...so it's been kind of ingrained in me. But I just want to stop doing this. I want to stop being a closet racist. As hard as I try, fighting these feelings is such an uphill battle. Does anyone here have any suggestions? Do I need therapy to "deprogram" my brain? I can't keep feeling this way. I'm going to end up being a hateful, spiteful little man. I don't want to go down that road and I don't want to hate, or even have any form of antagonistic feelings against people I've never met before. Is there any way to get over my "hate" of other races (especially white people)? Is there any way for me to get over my own "racial pride", thinking that all colored people of my race have to stick together? In spite of my hypocrisy, please don't hate or judge me for confessing something like this.
