I miss the 1950's when the chrome was thick and the country was normal. I fantasize walking near Riley Robb eating an ice cream cone next to the beautiful 1950's Art Deco building, and then I see a 1957 Chevy with a Labrador retriever inside.....oh those where the days when Eisenhower was President and the music was cheerful. Why can't I just be home going to a 1950's dance party with my girl? I can't wait until I graduate and we an finally move to a small town where I can go visit the Streamlined Moderne style diner and listen to the jukebox to my favorite hits.
