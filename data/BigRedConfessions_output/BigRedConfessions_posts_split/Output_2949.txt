I really enjoy being alone--whether it's eating meals by myself, or walking to classes and taking in my surroundings. I know some people who see me often may think I'm antisocial or have no friends, but I know there are a lot of people like me as well. This is me reminding myself (and maybe others) that it's ok not to feel like you have to be around people all the time (or even ever?)!
