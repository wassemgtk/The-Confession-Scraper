I wish someone would tell those two girls in Kroch to shut up and go gossip outside. Loud whispers and the frequent break out into laughter makes me want to slap them. The occasional talk in a silent zone is fine but  if you want to have a life long conversation, go away and let the rest of us study. Some of us have more important things to do in life than talk about the girl that guy took to formal.
