I don't know what to confess.  I guess, I'm just not terribly happy right now.  I was happy until he started questioning me, and now I'm thinking about things I've never thought about before just because he's put those thoughts there.  If he hadn't, I'd be fine and dandy. 
I feel like I just have to do what I want to do.  He's always been about sacrificing everything for family, and I think he's kind of miserable right now.  Yes, you have to care for family.  I love mine to death.  I love you guys so much, and I totally agree about prioritizing family.  But it is also really important to take care of yourself.  If you don't take care of yourself, you can't properly take care of your family.
I think you need to take care of yourself more.  You need to assess your situation and focus on yourself.  What will make you happy?  It can't be from me, or from substances.  It has to be from yourself.
