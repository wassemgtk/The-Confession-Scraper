I wish my former friend realized that I come from the NJ/NYC area. I grew up to have a cynical attitude and to never praise myself. I always think of how to improve things and make myself better. I can never say that I am a winner and always see myself as a loser in things. I strive to be a perfectionist and in all my business enterprises that's what I do. I know life on the other side of the country is slower-paced, but here life is fast-paced and you can image it as having to push through a closing subway door at the last minute to make it to your next meeting, etc. That's NY and that's why I love it. It drives me to work hard constantly and to take things with a grain of salt. I don't trust anyone and I kill myself to be off really well and not have to worry about money. I love making connections, going to my social clubs, and going to the range with my buddies to have a good time on the weekends, since we all work in finance. I am passionate about architecture and need someone who can sit and talk design over a glass of 1989 Robert Mondavi Cabarnet Sauvignon Private Reserve from my wine cellar and Finger Lakes Champagne Cheese with crackers and Napa Valley grapes. Anyone want to apply and think they can handle it?
