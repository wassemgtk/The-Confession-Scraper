I am sorry that we have drifted apart. There were good times, and there were bad times. However, I cannot stand you and your obsession over that guy anymore. I am tired and I do not want to help you since you refuse to listen to me. You keep insisting I do not know how you feel even though I am going through the same post-breakup thing. Let me tell you this, I live, and so do you. Stop being dramatic! I am here to support you, but I am not here to be dragged in your mess. We all have good days and bad days, just don't only come to me on the bad days.

Am I bitter? Absolutely. I did not complain to you when I have problems. I did not treat you like a dumpster either. But you, dear friend, you did!

I don't hate you. I still care for you. If there is anything happening to you, I will be one of the first people jumping out there to support you. I just hope you understand my perspective.

~Your friend
