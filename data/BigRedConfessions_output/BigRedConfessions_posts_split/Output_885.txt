why should i be made to feel like a slut because i am gay and having hot sex now? fuck your judgements. yaaaa cornell is a liberal school so how come i get slut shamed so much? seriously tired of the hypocritical BS that cornell subcultures are. can't wait to graduate, get the fuck out and have hot sex
