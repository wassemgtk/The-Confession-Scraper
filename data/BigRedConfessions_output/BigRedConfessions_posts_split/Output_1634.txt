I am so grateful for my parents. Sure, I complain about their quirks but talking to people here (and reading posts on Confessions/Overheard) has made me truly realize how amazingly lucky I am. They have made so many sacrifices over my life to allow me to be at Cornell today.  Above anything else, they value education. My dad has a solid job, but still has been saving money since (literally) before I was born, so I could attend college without the limitations of financial worry. 

He is also well-versed in the career world. As in he is able to give me advice (good advice) about what classes to take, how to find/apply to internships, etc. He wrote my first resume in early high school. I ask him for help and advice on so many things. As the son of two WWII refugees, he overcame so much and does so much so I don't have to overcome so many challenges. 

I guess with that, I also really want to acknowledge how much help and advantage I gain from him (and my mom). I can't imaging trying to navigate college/the world without them. I am constantly impressed and amazed with the tenacity and dedication and just... everything of students who are alone financially or are without their parents familiarity with the college/career world. Even the little things, just a general understanding of college, is so helpful. So I guess I just want to acknowledge that I feel unbelievably lucky to have my parents and I know I can't even begin to imagine the struggles people who aren't in my position face every day.
