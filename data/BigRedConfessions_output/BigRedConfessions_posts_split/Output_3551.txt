Continuation of 4471.
Saw you with him again. Of course you looked beautiful and graceful as always even drunk. I don't know anyone else who can be cute sexy brilliant and beautiful at the same time. I even considered talking to you but again, he was all over you. He must know how amazing you looked because me and all the guys standing around me couldn't stop staring at you. I wish you could see you like I do. There is no way he sees you for who you are, otherwise you'd be his by now. I know this is wrong, but I enrolled in a class I found out you'd be in. I just want to talk to you.
