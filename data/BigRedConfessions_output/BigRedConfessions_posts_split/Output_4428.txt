"I hate my brain. I've been sick up there either emotionally or mentally or psychologically or physically for as long as I can remember. If one problem stops, I end up with another. If I had to kill myself, I wish I could just chop my goddamn head off for all the trouble I've had from it.

Fuck intelligence, because none of it is worth anything if I can't function as a human being, even after trying every way I can think of to get help."
