One's dignity may be assaulted, vandalized, and cruelly mocked but it can never be taken away unless it is surrendered"" -Michael J Fox 

My dignity has been assaulted, vandalized, and cruelly mocked by you and others this year. I have been hurt. I've cried. I've felt like giving up... but I won't.

You're not going to break me. I deserve way better. It's unfortunate that you can't realize that.
