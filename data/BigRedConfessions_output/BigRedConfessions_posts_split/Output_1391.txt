To anyone whom relates:  You're in your twenties.  You're not a child anymore.  You don't have to wait till you're older to be fearless.  Apparently that doesn't come to everyone.  Apparently, old ladies still worry about their waist sizes.  How sad is that?  Why are you waiting?  What are you waiting for?  The moment when you realize that no one is as focused on yourself as you are?  You already know that!  You know what you have to do.  You have to stop giving a crap what everyone thinks.  You are fucking great.  We are all just bags of bones literally walking on the same Earth, living in the same time and space.  You aren't even 100% sure if this is all real.  There is absolutely no reason to be intimidated by anyone of those other bags of bones.  Live your life like the person you want to be, and you will become that person.  Seriously, just do it now.  You don't need to exude confidence, but you deserve to have full belief in your character.  Because your character is great, no matter what your dad, or society, or anyone says.  You are you, AND I LOVE YOU FOR THAT.
