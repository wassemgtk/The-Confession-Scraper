My life fell apart after a break-up from Hell and the only thing I have left is my dogs. If I couldn't come home and talk to them about my day, I think I would have had a nervous breakdown by now. I am torn between feeling happy that at least I can do one thing right by treating them well and feeling pathetic that they're the only thing keeping me from quitting my program and leaving behind all of the misery this place has brought me.
