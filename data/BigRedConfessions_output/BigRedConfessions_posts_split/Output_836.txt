It's only been several months since I transferred here from SoCal, but you guys are so welcoming! I’m happy that everyone who I meet seems excited to notice me. Because everyone is really great! You're always looking out for each other, and you let me play beer pong with you! So far the weather hasn’t been that bad, but I’m not looking forward to my first winter here. :/ David warned me that there would be lots of protests, but you guys have have been pretty good so far. Thanks again, Cornell, and I'm so grateful to be your president!
