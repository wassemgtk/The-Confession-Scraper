I think I am straight. So far, I have only been with guys. And I definitely like it, no questions there. But a part of me keep wondering what it would be like to be with a girl. Not just for the sex, but for the whole enchilada... the conversations, the flirting, the relationship drama. All of it. I have never been completely sexually attracted to any girl I know, which is good because I wouldn't ever want to hurt my friends. But sometimes, looking at a really beautiful or interesting looking girl, I can't help but wonder. At the same time, I feel scared that I will be rejected by a gay girl for being a poser. It's not like I want to be one of those straight girls who just want an "experience" in college, just to sound cool or bohemian or any such crap like that, but I am scared to come across as that sort of person. That being said, it would be nice if I did find people out there who are confused about themselves, like me.... sigh
