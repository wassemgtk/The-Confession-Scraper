As someone who actually has OCD, and has dangerous compulsions, it frustrates me completely when people say, "Oh I'm a little OCD," when they prefer something a certain way or are a marginally clean person. Oh, you like your shoes all nice and neat on your shoe rack? I had to really concentrate this morning when I locked my door so I didn't keep walking back up the stairs to check that I really locked it. I guess I'm just a little OCD, oops. 

TL;DR OCD is an actual disorder that affects people, not just a mild desire to have everything your way.
