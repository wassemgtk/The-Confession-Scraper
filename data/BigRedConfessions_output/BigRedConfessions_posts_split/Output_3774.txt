Beauty-based sexual attraction is not well-suited to modern society. I understand the evolutionary reason for it: a long time ago, it was beneficial to choose a good-looking mate because good looks were indicative of health. But today, everyone is healthy. And I don't mean that in an insensitive way; I'm just saying that modern medicine can overcome most problems. Unless there's something like a genetic disorder that runs in the family, there's very little reason to judge someone as a poor mate based on their health. So why does sexual attraction based on beauty still exist? I know a lot of fantastic people who I would date except for the fact that I'm not sexually attracted to them in the slightest. I might be shallow, but sexual attraction should not be underestimated as a key part of a functioning relationship. I just can't be with someone whose appearance doesn't get me excited. But from my experience, appearances indicate absolutely nothing about a person. Nada. The most beautiful person could be a demon on the inside, and the ugliest person out there could be an angel. It's a problem I wish we could eliminate. Think of the possibilities if a person whose personality worked well with yours would always be a good candidate for a relationship! It's just a bummer is all I'm saying.
