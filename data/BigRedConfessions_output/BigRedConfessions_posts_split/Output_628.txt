I had a decent grasp on the material in Chem 2070 - I got 90s and 100s on the lab reports and I got the majority of questions on the problem sets correct. Yet I scored below the average for both prelims, though I got within the standard deviations. I ended with a C in Chem, as well as a C in calc, As in sociology and my FWS, and a 2.7 GPA. As a pre-med student, I am extremely worried that I won't be accepted into medical school with grades like this. Yes, it's only my first semester ever at Cornell, but doesn't this predict how I will do in following semesters? Can someone offer me some advice? Is staying at Cornell even worth the hardships it carries? Should I just transfer to a school where I can actually achieve good grades and a GPA above a 3.5?
