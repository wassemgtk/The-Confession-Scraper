I'm always confused by the small amount of white people I see at events that discuss diversity or people of color face in college. It's Black History Month and I haven't seen one person at any of the events celebrating black culture and history. Everyone here claims to love diversity and learning about new cultures but noone here acts like they do. We only seem to complain about how we self-segregate ourselves.
