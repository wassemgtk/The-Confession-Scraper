I am a rising junior with a 2.5 gpa. It rose from my 2.3 after freshmen year, but what am I going to do? Sure, I can affiliate with the college of engineering and still be an engineer like I want to, but is that enough? I have to start worrying about jobs, internships, and getting hired. My dreams of research have already been shot down by my awful gpa. And now I just got a U for something that only required attendance. I'm just screwed. All those stories I've heard of kids improving don't seem to apply to me. All I wanted was to learn and make myself use to the world but I can't do anything right here. Nothing seems to matter anymore. I don't feel like I'm worth anything. I'm so sorry
