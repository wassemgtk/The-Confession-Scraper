Here's my confession: I look around this campus and I realize just how lonely I am. I have an inadequate personality and I'm not charming, funny, or even close to appealing compared to many other guys (and I guess I can be a bit annoying) and it's difficult for me to establish good friendships with other people. I've told myself almost everyday that this is just how it is and I've accepted it, but I can't embrace it because it still depresses me to know that I can never have the types of friendships and relationships other have. I just want a sense of peace or belonging and I'm not sure how to get there.
