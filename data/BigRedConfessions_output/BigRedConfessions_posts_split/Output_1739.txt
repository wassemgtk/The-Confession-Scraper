In response to #6307

   My heart was strained the moment I saw this post. I had to stop every work at hand and walk around impetuously to mitigate the pain. But I couldn’t. The pain keeps gripping my heart and my head is suffocated. I can’t stop thinking: what if it’s you? And I decided that I have to write a response, even though it’s possible that on the other side of a computer sits a complete stranger, disappointed over a confusing response from an undesired man, while you, who have dominated my mind since we met, is watching the drama unfold with a bag of popcorn in hand. 

   I like your sheer life energy and your innocent joy. Whenever I see you and talk to you, I feel like there’s a child miraculously preserved in your heart. Often, when I walk around this campus, I feel I’m a little child walking amidst a bunch of scary, grown up college students, so whenever I’m by your side, I feel happy and secure. I think that’s why overtime, my feeling for you grew stronger and stronger, until it developed into a kind of attachment that I had never imagined before, completely different from the immature, teenage attractions. 

   Now, you talk about your being depressed, and you think nobody would want to be in a relationship with you. To be honest, although I was never sure, I had always been contemplating if there is such darkness deep inside your heart. That’s why I felt skeptical when you kept me away. But at that time, I also thought maybe I was overthinking, maybe you really didn’t like me, so it’s better for me to retreat to my own world. But not for a second had I thought about getting away from you because of that potential darkness. Especially after reading this post, I realized that so long as you are miserable, I cannot feel happy. And how can I give less shit to some god damned “normal girl”? Do I look like a sane, normal person? All I want is you to be happy!

   If it is indeed you who wrote this post, I think you may recognize me. If it’s someone else, I sincerely apologize for the trouble I made. I’m a fool in such matters, so it might take some time for me to figure out what I should do. But I want you to know that I’m here, and will always be.
