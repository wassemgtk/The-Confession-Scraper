We have gotten to the point where North Korea has created a hydrogen bomb and blasted it. I am afraid they may have the power to attack us soon. :( Our president does nothing to stop it because the North Korea views him as a weak leader whom they are not afraid of. Reagan knocked down walls including the Berlin Wall and lead to the eventual collapse of communism in the Soviet Union. We need a strong leader because our country is in serious trouble. We don't win anymore. We lose to everybody at trade and at the border. Other countries are taking away our jobs. I cannot believe that most of my Cornell peers are so liberal they support our current president and cannot find fault in anything he does even though he has practically decimated our beautiful country. I hope that they could support a candidate who tells it like it is and is not afraid for us to have a strong military so that we can defeat North Korea just by showing our strength.
