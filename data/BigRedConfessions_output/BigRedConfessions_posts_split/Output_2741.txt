A lot of people have told me the "big fish in a small pond" experience that I'd get from going to a state school or whatever pales in comparison to the Cornell experience. The theory is that even if work yourself to death at Cornell and still don't do that well, Cornell will get you prepared for the real world. And maybe that is true; I feel like Cornell has made me a wiser person. But a conversation with my parents today forces me to wonder whether that's actually worth the emotional toll that this place takes on me. 

They were asking me whether I was happy here, and although I have my reasons for being happy (mainly my friends, they're great), I must say that in conventional terms (grades! extracurricular accomplishments! research opportunities! summer plans!), my freshman year has been tremendously unsuccessful. It hurts so much to admit that to myself and to my parents. They still think I'm good at school and accomplished outside of school, but they don't realize that that phase of my life is long gone. I do virtually no clubs, get poor grades, and there are people who probably work half as hard as I do and can still kick my ass in any subject. 

I get that college can't be all sunshine and rainbows, but I don't think it's supposed to be four years of self-loathing either. But when I look back at the amount of money my parents are pouring into this institution, and the fact that I can't even access some of the things that make Cornell great (e.g. engineering project teams, etc.) the whole thing seems so fucking pathetic. My mom and dad love me and they're paying for an education and I'm literally just pissing it away. I'm not qualified for a project team because I did conventional stuff like debate team in high school instead of robotics team; some people can just think through technical questions but I've never had to do stuff like that. And although project teams are supposed to be an environment for people to learn how to work on engineering tasks together, when you have all these brilliant kids competing, a kid like me is just going to get eaten alive. 

Not only am I not qualified for many of Cornell's project teams (which I know aren't the only way to go as far as engineering extracurriculars, but they're so heavily emphasized that it sure as hell seems that way), but I'm also not capable of handling the work here. I study and take notes and blah blah blah but my grades are mediocre. This doesn't bother me as much as the fact that I can't participate in activities (I guess being average in a bunch of smart kids is still pretty smart) , but it does rub a little salt into the wound. 

Anyways, all that stuff has me wondering why on earth Cornell took me. And I realllllly don't like to say it, but I think I know why. When I got into Cornell, I received a likely letter from the engineering school, and I was happy to get in somewhere so I didn't think much of it, until I started receiving emails from the Diversity Programs in Engineering. Then I started wondering, am I just a diversity recruit? But I figured that if I worked hard enough, I'd be able to dispel those sorts of thoughts. 

Then I got here, and slowly, little by little, lost faith in myself. I wrote applications, I studied hard for exams, I budgeted time well, and the only thing that came back to me was failure. And it's easy to forget about being such a failure when you're at college because everyone kind of suffers together. But when you come home and have to talk to your parents about school and why your friends are more accomplished than you and what they have that you don't have and all that stuff, it just makes the feeling of inadequacy resurface and hit you in the gut ten times as hard as it ever did. Basically my parents are asking me "so, where is our money going" and my answer is "It's being flushed down the toilet, but I've made some friends in the process so it wasn't a total loss" What kind of answer is that ? It's a disgrace! 

I'm a disgrace. 

Maybe I'm the only female engineer at Cornell who feels this way. But in my opinion, all the evidence points the the fact I'm not qualified. Which means Cornell shouldn't have ACCEPTED me. I am angry that they accepted me. Bridging the gender gap in engineering is important. However, I can't help feeling that by baiting me with a likely letter, Cornell was setting me up to fail. Why put me into a place where I'm obviously out of my league? Just to make Cornell's diversity statistics look nice? Is my main purpose for being at this institution just a matter of statistics? 

Sure, everyone says "Be resilient! Persist! Apply, apply, apply!" But just keep in mind that while I'm busy being fucking resilient and typing up applications until my fingers bleed, there are people at other schools actually spending their time on meaningful activities. Sure, maybe after applying to 3489207 clubs, I will be able to write a damn good paragraph on why I am interested in XYZ or what I like to do in my free time. But I'd rather be able to actually write a program or research something than be good at writing applications. If Cornell had rejected me, maybe I'd be doing those things right from the get go, instead of spending half my college career applying to things before ever doing a single thing of value. And I'd probably save a shitton of money as well. 

I've disappointed too many people, myself included. This is a great school, but I don't think I can access enough of its greatness to make coming to Cornell worth the financial and emotional price tag. 

I should have picked a college that wanted me for my qualifications, and not my uterus.
