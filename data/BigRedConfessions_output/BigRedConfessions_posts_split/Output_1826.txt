I really, really wish there was a way to privately message people who posted confessions. So many I relate to and would love to reach out to, but I'm too scared/embarrassed to admit it publicly. Someday I hope I will have the courage. I know I'm not the only person who feels this way.

Any of the amazingly talented CS people want create such a system?
