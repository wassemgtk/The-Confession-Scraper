I am so lonely. Ever since I moved off campus I hardly see any of my friends. And I never really had that many in my major so I'm all alone in class too.  And it's been really hard on me. Honestly, I haven't been this depressed since freshman year and I was really fucked up then. I just hate being alone so much. And the times that I'm with people there is such a stark contrast before, during, and after. I can be depressed as all fuck immediately before and after butt during I'm actually happy. I'm more productive even if I'm just in the same space as friends even if we're doing completely different things. And I find I can actually enjoy myself.  But they have to be friends. Being around a bunch of people who aren't is even worse than when I'm alone. Which is often why I don't go to class. I'm just really lost right now
