"I wrote this poem in like 10th grade and it still applies to my life now... sad.

Now I know why they call it a crush;
But in all honesty, maybe I was expecting too much.
Because all I wanted was to feel your touch; with your hands entwined in mine.
And is it pathetic that every time you smiled it made my day?
All that things that I planned to do and wanted to say;
Nothing will happen.
It’s hard to accept; that feelings so bright could not be returned;
My sweaty palms, nervous giggles, & mute voice with which you weren’t even concerned.
Why did I allow you to affect me in this way when you didn’t even care?
I sit here & sigh & think the clichéd words that life’s not fair.
When it is right it’ll happen, & you and me were definitely not right.
But what gives me solace is that my future flies limitlessly in the wind like a kite.
This may be the end of us & my butterflies may have had their wings ripped off so violently,
But you know what? Go kiss that smut! While my prince appears beside me silently"
