I'm having some serious issues with depression, and I don't know what to do. Every time I try and talk to people about it, they try and say I have no right to be depressed. Maybe I don't deserve to be, but, Jesus Christ, I can't stop thinking this way. You all make it sound like you can just turn it off, but maybe I can't. I've been bottling it up for all these years, and it's starting to force its way out. Help.
