"i feel like no matter how hard I work, I'm going to be that C+/B- student.

Today I had a professor tell me that he had no idea how I did so poorly on my final and that i know the concepts because I participate so much in class.

But I don't know how to say is that I feel periodically empty and sad, that I frequently bite off more than I can chew, because sometimes, sometimes, I can literally do so much. Sometimes it only takes me 30 minutes to write an A+ paper, and 2 hours to throw together an A presentation. Sometimes it doesn't take that much time for me to do all my leadership roles and literally do more than the average student.

And sometimes it takes my all to get out of bed. To be able to focus and do one or two orgo problems while I feel a knot tied in my throat, wondering if I'll make it through the day, through the week, trying to motivate myself to move ahead, knowing that when I feel good again, I'll hate myself for how miserable I've been.

For those who write in the comments, I go to CAPS, I take my meds, I do what I need to do. I just wonder when this is going to stop.

I technically have PTSD. I hardly ever have the nightmares anymore, the bad dreams, the problems. But I still struggle with sadness. It just comes and slowly eats away at me, leaving me empty. And I always tell myself that maybe a successful semester will make me feel better. But then I get filled with sadness the week of a prelim. Or a final. And I get one STDev below the mean. And I lose the A that I worked so hard for.

I just wanna know when it will stop, and if it will mean that I'll never have a normal or happy life."
