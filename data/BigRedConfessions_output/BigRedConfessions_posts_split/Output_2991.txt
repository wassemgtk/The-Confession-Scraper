I met this girl during the summer and never really had interest in her but as I learned more about her and grew fond of her I really peaked interest in her. We have grown apart a bit this past semester and now I am pretty sure she doesn't feel the same way about me. I could tell her anything, but I just don't think she sees me the same. I wish we could be together... I could never possibly tell her how I feel because I know it may ruin what little we have left. I love her.
