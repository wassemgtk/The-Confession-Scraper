It seems that with every step I take, graduating from university seems more and more impossible. With every step, I feel like I'm losing myself and a sense of who I am more and more. 
But as wise men say, you will never understand your true character and personality until you lose them all. Until you become so losf and confused that you start noticing your behaviour little by little.
So I'm hoping and begging and wishing that soon, this feeling of...i don't know...emptiness will leave me and I will have my own self back again.
