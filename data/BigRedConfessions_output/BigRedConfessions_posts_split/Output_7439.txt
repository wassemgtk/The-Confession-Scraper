I really want to get to know you and always try make eye contact right after class so we can talk but you just quickly go away before I even notice. Why are you ignoring me? I'm just a girl who wants to be your friend or maybe more, but your gestures make it seem like you only want to be problem set buddies. I won't bite!!
