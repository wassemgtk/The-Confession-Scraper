I'm very surprised by the number of politically correct people are commenting and posting on overheard. These debates are so ridiculously elitist and it actually seems like a contest to see who's the most PC. Instead of getting into arguments over Facebook, why don't any of you who get offended by spilled milk and Instagram posts go around campus and actually talk to the workers you're so eager to speak for? You're so prepared to be the mouthpiece for the entirety of the maintenance staff on this campus but in reality, the vast majority of you have no idea what it's like to work at a job in the service sector. I think privileged people telling other privileged people to "check their privilege" so they can continue speaking for people they've probably never even talked to for more than two minutes is ironic and sad. We as workers do not need you to be our voice.
