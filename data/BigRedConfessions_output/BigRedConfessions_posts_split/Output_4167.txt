I really wish I could find a guy that I could fall in love with. Someone I could give a warm embrace to in the cold Ithaca autumns and winters. Someone who I could hold close and someone who would do the same for me. I want give someone the world and someone I could laugh effortlessly with. I wish for once, I could fall in love.
