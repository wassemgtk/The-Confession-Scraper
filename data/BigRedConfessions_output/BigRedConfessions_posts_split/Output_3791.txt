My ex is married, we broke up like 2 years ago. I was completely over her and we use to talk once in a while. A few weeks back she called me and said 'I am coming to New York and I want to do you'. Even though I said no it is been playing in my head for weeks. I was planning to go to New York with a Friend for Christmas, which I don't want to and I am doing poorly in my studies. Exam week is here and I still can't focus.
