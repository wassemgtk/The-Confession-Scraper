I'm usually in the libraries studying, especially for big tests like the finals, but I haven't been going. Why? Because I'm really sick and I can't stop coughing, sneezing, or blowing my nose, and I think nobody else should have to deal with all that noise when they're trying to focus. I know I wouldn't want that, so I just hole myself up in my room like a bum and study there :) I know many people are often sick and talking in the libraries, but I have no intention on being another one of those people passing on their illnesses (being in such close proximity) and being a distraction. Good luck on your finals guys!
