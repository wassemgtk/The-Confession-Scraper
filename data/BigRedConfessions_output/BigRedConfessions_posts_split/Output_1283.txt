Do people think about their lives in Cornell? All the time we are pursuing these academic milestones, and yet many people do not know what they want to do. I don't really have as much of a passion for my major as I did coming in, and can't really find anything else that motivates me either. How do people find meaning in what they do? How can they feel that the things we study are that important? Is the most important thing in life to have a good job and earn lots of money, or do thing thing you love? 

Contemplation...
