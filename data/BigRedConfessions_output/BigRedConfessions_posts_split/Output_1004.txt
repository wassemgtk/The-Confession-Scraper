Is there any social justice group on campus that does work other than self-advocacy? I'm really interested in getting involved, but I have yet to find any of the kind of groups I'm looking for. I'm hoping to find a group working with rights in developing countries. Specifically, I'm really interested right now in access to feminine hygiene products. It seems mundane, but there's a real problem that girls can't go to school in rural areas because they're spending one week out every month bleeding from their body. It's unsanitary, and they aren't able to go to school. In some places, it's by far one of the biggest barriers to development and equality for women. It doesn't require any significant paradigm shift to solve, women just need access to reusable pads. That's the kind of movement I want to be involved in.

Is there any group like that on campus? Not necessarily for feminine hygiene, but for developing countries.
