I have very few memories from my life. I'm having trouble remembering most of what's happened prior to a year ago. I keep finding stuff on my computer that I did or or things I posted on the internet or old chats with friends and I am amazed at how little of it I remember, if any, and how little the things I seemed to care about still exist in my brain. I realize some of this is normal, but most of it is due to the fact that a lot of these "memories" were made either in front of a monitor or when I'd been by myself. I remember a lot of things that involved other people, but sadly not too many of these memories exist. Let that be a lesson to you all - very few moments that you share with no one, or that you only share with people through an internet connection will remain. Most of what you will remember, what you will call the "best days of your life", the things that you'll be thankful you did, all will involve other people in real life. Seems obvious I know, but it's an important thing to keep at the forefront of your mind, especially for those of you who think being alone/a computer can in any way substitute real life with real people. Any event that takes place in that context is insignificant even if it seems significant to you at the time. Don't waste your youth like I did. Get out there and make mistakes!

Sincerely,

An alum
