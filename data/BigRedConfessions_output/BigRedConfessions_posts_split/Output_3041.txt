Fuck you, and you and you and you, too. You guys suck. You're grown men... why are you taking sides like middle school girls??? Jeez, and here I thought guys didn't have drama in their friendships... 

But at the end of the day, no matter how hard you try to mess up my life and throw me off, I'm going to get over it and keep doing what I want to do, so your loss. :/
