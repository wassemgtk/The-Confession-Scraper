"I some help sorting something out.  My father makes me feel like what I'm doing is all me.  He makes me feel secluded and he tries to make me feel guilty or something because of my decisions.  I value his opinion and when I ask he acts like he doesn't have any opinion because ""I'm doing my own thing.""  This all started because I didn't take his offer at opportunities that he has to offer.  Because I was not interested in following his career path or taking the opportunities that he ""went out of his way"" to offer to me, he acts this way towards me.  He doesn't understand that different people get different things out of work and I will not be fulfilled doing physical labor in his field.  I realize that he is offering everything that he has, and maybe that is why he feels hurt that I am not jumping on the opportunities he is offering but it is simply not what I want.  

Regardless, I want him to support me and be a part of what I'm up to.  Just because I'm not following his path doesn't mean that he can't be involved, but that's how he acts.  I don't want to feel guilty but somehow I do.  He makes me feel bad for being away at college, for not doing what he wants me to do and when I'm ""home"" he makes me feel like I can't have an opinion without compromising his household.  At this point, he acts like I'm some out of control child and like he doesn't want to give input because he's given me all he can.  I'm not a bad kid.  I just want to be supported in what I'm doing, not be made to feel like I'm a mess up living on an island by myself.    "
