So NY didn't pass the DREAM act. What a load of bull. I actually have friends who have worked their asses off for as long as they've been here and for what? Do I tell them that all that work that they did is for nothing? That they should stop trying? Something needs to be done, because this is just not acceptable. I'm truly disgusted by NY state. I expected better from you. Forget it being a political issue; this is a human right's issue and we've failed so many people. We all have dreams, damn it, and they are ALL valid. I can't stand to see my friends and family suffer because of this. I hope they don't give up, because I sure as hell won't.
