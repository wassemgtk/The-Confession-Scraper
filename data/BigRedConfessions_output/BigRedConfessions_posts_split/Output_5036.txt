Depression has lived in me since I was 11. That year, I was bullied by my classmates as well as my teachers. I still don't know if my parents know anything about that, because I never said anything, and I never trusted them. They fought all the time, and I fought with my dad all the time. 
The same year, my grandpa passed away. Even though I didn't tell him anything related to what happened at school, when he sensed that something was not right, he always stood up for me. I felt I died once when he passed away.
However, the most difficult thing was to pretend that I was fine, to lift up to the expectation other people put on me, and to be all strong and happy. I know, it's stupid of me, but I didn't know better.
So, what happen afterwards? Life goes on. I tried to open up, but everyone has difficulties in life, and why would anyone care about how I feel? So, I just kept studying and got into Cornell. I guess depression is something I have to live with.
