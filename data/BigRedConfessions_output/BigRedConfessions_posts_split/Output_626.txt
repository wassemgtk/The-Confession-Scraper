"I'm tackling my spirituality incorrectly, I think.  I keep trying to logic a god in my head, and I'm pretty sure that's wrong.  I think I'm looking for a feeling; something warm, and enveloping, and reassuring.  Maybe I'll never find it, but I feel like I'm on the right path.  
I just read a great book about a kid who struggles in finding himself, but in the end he finally does!  I know who I am.  I've got strong values I hold onto quite tightly, but I often depend on outside sources to help me form opinions.  It's really so easy to do in this day and age, with Google at the tips of our fingers and all that.  And on top of that, I've become a person who second-guesses herself.  I always question if what I'm doing is right or wrong.  Sometimes I'm stricken with a fear that I'm an awful person.  It's all just a manifestation of things that have been said to me by people I think I love.  Nah, I really do love them, but they torture me.  Such is love, I suppose.  
I'm going to try mediating more.  The kid in the book fire meditates.  Just thinking about it sounds so relaxing.  
Life keeps brining perspective-changing people (fictional and real life) my way, adding again and again to the excitement I keep feeling.  "
