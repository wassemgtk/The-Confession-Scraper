Everyone here has been making social connections so quickly that it's scary. They had already established their group of hallmates and started making connections out at parties before move-in day was done. Everything here is just way more fast-paced socially than I'm used too or capable of keeping up with. I'm pretty confident that I'll catch up eventually, but for now, it just seems like I'm trailing behind everyone and desperately trying to catch up.
