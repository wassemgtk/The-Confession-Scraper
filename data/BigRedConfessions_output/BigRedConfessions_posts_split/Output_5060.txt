I don't care if you don't post this on the Confessions wall, but I just wanted to thank the admins for keeping this page updated even throughout the summer. Reading these confessions just reinforces my love for Cornell -- our school consists of genuine people, who come from different backgrounds, who appreciate the amazing opportunity of premium class education, who know how to feel both love and hatred and happiness and sadness, and who accept their sexuality. I struggled academically this past semester, but reading these confessions helped me get over myself and realize that I'm not the only one in this boat. Even after the academic struggle last year, I can't wait to go back to Cornell after this godforsakenly long summer vacation, and I have the admins to partially thank for my love and pride for Cornell.
