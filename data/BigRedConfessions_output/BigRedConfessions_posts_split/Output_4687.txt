"I'd like to think that if I ran into you around campus I would give you a piece of my mind. Something like, ""I never thought you'd be cowardly enough to leave without saying goodbye. I had a great summer without you. I hope you flinch every time you walk past the clock tower.""

I'd like to think that, but I know I'd end up forgetting every ounce of anger I have for you, smiling, and asking how you've been."
