Dude!! We both live on West, so we're bound to keep running into each other on stairways, paths between dorms, in dining halls, etc. I cannot be more clear: I DON'T LIKE YOU ANYMORE. I don't think about you AT ALL. At this point, the whole, trivial matter is like a long, sad joke to me, like much of my love life until recently lol. Yes, what I did was unbelievably stupid (although I really should have been able to confess in peace, and your friend's unnecessary instigating is ultimately to blame here.) Yes, I would be pretty disgusted by my presence if I were you too AT FIRST. But...seriously? Are we really still doing this? Get over yourself. The way I see it, we have four options here:

1. We can be strangers who walk right past each other. This simply requires that you get over yourself and forget, like I have. Then, even when we do see each other, I won't have to be reminded by your averting eyes and change in facial expression that we're not complete strangers.
 
2. We can just pretend to be strangers, which again is not hard, if you just get over yourself and forget like I have. 

3. We can deal with the issue. I'm happy to do this, if you'd like. This again requires that you get over yourself. The next time you see me, just walk up and acknowledge that I'm the guy who made that post. I think you'd find that the dumb-ass kid who did that and the person you talk to are very different, and we'd end our correspondence on neutral terms. We don't even have to be acquaintances. I just don't want to have to vent on here every time I run into you, be slightly miffed for the rest of the day, wake up  having forgotten about you completely, then run into you again a week later and repeat the process.

4. We can keep doing this shit, and no one wins.

Oh, and if you'd rather I broach the issue/approach you first, just let me know through here. I'm totally happy to do that, and would prefer it. I just figure you don't want anything to do with me, which is fine lol
