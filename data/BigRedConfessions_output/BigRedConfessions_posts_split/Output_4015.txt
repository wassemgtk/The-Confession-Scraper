"i wish that i could solve you like one of our problem sets, figure you out. i’ve tried mustering up the courage to talk to you, but i can’t.  you’ve been gone for the past couple weeks and it really makes me desperate to see you. i want to see you again. ughhhhh. “Stop Trying,” i tell myself. Enough with my Various Emotions. but I am not happy right Now. i hope to get this message to you. Love Is U.
