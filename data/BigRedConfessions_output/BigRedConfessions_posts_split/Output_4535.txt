Sometimes I seriously hate my boobs. People generally don't believe me if I ever talk sizing (no, a 36DD will NOT fit properly). They also say stupid shit like, "But you can only get boobs that size from surgery," or "Are you sure you know what you're talking about?" Yes, that is my actual size. No, I'm not making this up, as I have no reason to. No, trust me, them getting this big wasn't exactly voluntary. Yes, I know what I'm talking about. The fact that I wanted to have them stop bouncing painfully ALL THE TIME pretty much necessitated an ability to find a well-fitting bra. Speaking of...
Finding a bra that fits is near impossible. There essentially isn't a store closer than NYC that stocks my size. Yeah, Amazon and other online stores are pretty much my best friends in that department. It pretty much blows not being able to try anything on before I order it (thank you, Amazon, for your free return shipping). And the bigger you go, the selection drops to nothing. Seriously, stores are missing out on a big opportunity to make some money off big-boobed women's desire to have a cute bra. And speaking of money, it's far from cheap. VS is certainly overpriced (quality is shit regardless), but most of their bras are still less expensive than anything I can buy. If it's under $50, I'm ecstatic. Under $35, there's actually a happy dance involved.
Then you get to clothes. Forget finding a fitted dress. It either looks like I'm trying to escape boob prison or there's a flood of material around my waist and even my hips a little. Button down shirts? No, thanks, I don't want everyone to be playing peek-a-boo with my chest.
Finally, people stare. It's awkward as fuck. I mind this less than comments though. Seriously? Did you think I was somehow unaware of the magnitude of the sacks of tissue strapped to my chest? Lol, nope. And then what the hell is with people who think it's okay to just grab boobs? I understand how gravitational attraction works, but if you try to touch me without my consent, I will stick an elbow in your throat and break your nose.
So i guess what it all boils down to is: it's not fabulous all the time. Try to have a little empathy in that regard.
