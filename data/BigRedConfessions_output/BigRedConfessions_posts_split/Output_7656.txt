I hate it when guys call women "females." Any animal can be a female. It takes a human, a person, to be a woman. You're making women sound like just pieces of meat. Just know that when you're talking about "all the females" you're trying to do stuff with, you don't sound cool; you sound like an ass. On that same note, stop calling women "girls." I can guarantee you that every woman you've met on this campus stopped being a "girl" a while ago. You go to an Ivy League school. At least pretend like you have some sense.
