"I hated the confession page first, - maybe just because l am a graduate student. - And when my friend started to ask me if l posted anything on this page. I said no, and wanted to see the post s/he claims was written by me.

 I read some posts, and some were exactly what l have been going through. Even if it is meaningless, this page helps a lot! You recognize while everyone seems happy and good out there, there are bunch of other people experiencing hard times as you do."
