I'm so done with this game that we play, you staring, flirting, then when I finally do something to say I'm into you, you just brushing me off, or not texting me back. I'm not your fucking marionette doll. Stop being a wuss or doing whatever the hell this is and make a move or forever hold your fuckin peace.
