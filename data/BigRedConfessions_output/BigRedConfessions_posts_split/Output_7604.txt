I love you to pieces. You're one of the best people I've ever met, but damn, you're one of the most self-centered people I've ever met too. Lately, we spend all our time talking about your problems, and when we start talking about something else, it somehow always comes back to you...how does that even happen? Here's a thought: Learn to be more considerate. Learn to listen. Learn to be helpful. And stop fixating on yourself. The world's population consists of more than just you and whichever guy broke your heart this time. I'd definitely appreciate it, and it might actually help your problems too.
