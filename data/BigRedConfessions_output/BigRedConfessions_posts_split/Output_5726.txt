"Dear complete rando I grinded with on the slope,

I feel I must apologize for the blue-ball hell I left you in. We danced for so long, and you probably thought you would be getting it in. Alas, fate brought us together and just as easily tore us apart. And by fate, I mean the massive crowd of people pushing you into me, my complete indifference towards grinding on whomever I'm standing in front of (even super aggressive creeps who just pull me towards them), and my desire to resume treating you as if you don't exist as soon as the concert ended. I truly hope the rest of your Slope Day fared as well, if not better. But then I actually don't care at all one way or another.

Sincerely yours (for about an hour that one time),
Complete rando you grinded with on the slope <3"
