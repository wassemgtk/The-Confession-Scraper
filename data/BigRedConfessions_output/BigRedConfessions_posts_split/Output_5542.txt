I'm so lonely here... I don't know how I'm missing all of these connections... I'm such a boring person when you first get to know me, I have no idea how to just be myself when I talk to new people. I'm afraid I'll scare them off though... I just see all these other people that have made so many friends and connections in just one year here and I've barely made any. I've tried, I really have. I don't know what I'm doing wrong. It's gonna be a lonely summer.
