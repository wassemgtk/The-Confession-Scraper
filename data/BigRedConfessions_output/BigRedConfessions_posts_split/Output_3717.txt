There is something really strange that has gone on this entire semester but I haven't posted about it because my roommate will know without a doubt that I am talking about her.... Now that she is done with the semester and moved out (and I'm going abroad) I can finally say what has been going on. My roommate literally lives in our bathtub. It is the weirdest thing I have ever seen someone do... She literally has a hot plate and a hot water boiler in out bathroom so she can cook and make coffee/tea while she is in the tub. She even does her homework in it. It's the weirdest thing I have ever seen....
