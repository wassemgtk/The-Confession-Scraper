Pretty sure 2 sorority sisters are messing with me right now. I was sent identical tinder messages in the span of 5 minutes, one of which was very forward. I called one out on it and she said she didn't know the other girl (who is in pictures on her wall). And I don't know if it's random, girls I know in their house, or my ex (friends with both) who is behind it, if it's not a coincidence anyway. Their distances were also identical and far outside my range...

They also both have this page liked, and have a fair shot at seeing it.
