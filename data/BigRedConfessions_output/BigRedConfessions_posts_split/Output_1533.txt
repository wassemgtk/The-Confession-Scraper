Girl who put on red lipstick last night and aggressively danced, girl who looked around the room while dancing with her friends hoping that one of the guys will ask to dance with you. Just know you were watched and we all saw. Girl who will probably do it all over again, I'll be brave enough to ask you to dance next time. (Written on 10/18/2015)
