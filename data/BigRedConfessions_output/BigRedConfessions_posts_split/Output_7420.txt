"My sincerest apologies in advance for this rant:
I swear I live with the 2 most cynical freshman girls (note how I don't say young women).
They probably don't even know what cynical means... 
They are beyond lacking in class and think they are still in high school.
They talk about me behind my back and think I can't hear them. 
They can't even confront me face to face about things that bother them about our living situation.
When they have talked to me (more like at me) they are always either mocking me or insulting who I am friends with, what I do, where I go, what my major is, future plans etc...
To make matter worse one of them is a power hungry b**** who thinks that taking out her personal problems on others is the way to go. 
I could go on and on...
But my point is: just because you go to an Ivy League school does not mean you are automatically granted class, compassion, courtesy, and similar characteristics.

I keep my mouth shut about all of this but I'm pretty sure I have been a victim of verbal abuse several times, but this is my only outlet for the time being.

All I can do for the rest of the semester is study outside of my dorm room and come home really late/ leave really early to avoid these people...

I hope whoever has been putting me through this misery reads this and feels very damn sorry if they are capable of doing so...

Please tell me I'm not the only one who has been through this...
