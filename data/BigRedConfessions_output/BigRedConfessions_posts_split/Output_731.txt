I have had some many loved ones that died during my childhood. My childhood was a realm of struggle and death and I think that has had a tremendous effect on me since teenage years to my adult years. Sometimes I feel like I cant trust anyone or be emotionally attached to anyone, not even my sister. I feel like if any of my immediate family were to die right now, I would be literally feel nothing. Is that horrible?
