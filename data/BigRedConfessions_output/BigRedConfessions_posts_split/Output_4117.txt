"As time has slowly passed (at least, it feels like that to me), it has sort of helped me to reduce the amount to think about you. When I met you, as odd as it may sound, I knew you would become someone truly special for me. Those beautiful light-brown eyes, your light-brownish hair, and the beard! I still remember the first thing you told me, even if it has been more than 8 months ago! I would catch you looking at me and you would turn around! it was just too cute! ha! we started texting alot, the good and a bit flirty but nothing offensive, we ended up hanging out and thought we had it going on for each other. I had alot of fun yet i must admit that i was so nervous and my heart was racing so fast because I FINALLY got to see you again.. I thought we were both going to here in the fall yet you ended up telling me later on that you felt this was not YOUR school. 
I have sent messages yet none of them have been responded. I guess it must have a been a way of telling me ""You were not it.""
To me, you were much more than just it.
Hope you are well, i miss you very, very much, and can only hope to see you one more time.. As for now, I am going to do some squats.
