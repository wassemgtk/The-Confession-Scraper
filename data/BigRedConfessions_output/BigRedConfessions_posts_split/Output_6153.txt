I've just been diagnosed with an incurable disease. Out of the blue my life is turned on it's head and pretty soon it will be stopped permanently. From what I've been told, I will die. There is no hope. Every dream I've had of the life I wanted to live is gone. I'll be lucky if I make it to graduation in a few years. I'm not telling you this so you can feel sorry for me. I've done enough crying. I want to remind each and every one of you to not forget to live your life. Skip class. Leave the country. Hookup with that girl you think is out of your league. Do something reckless and stupid. Love the people around you. If I knew I was going to die before I turned 20 I would not have spent so much time doing nothing. If you're reading this right now, do me a favor: Get off Facebook. Pick up the phone and call the people you love. Remind them that they mean something to you. After that, go hangout with your friends. If you don't have any friends, go make some. Live in the moment and appreciate the future you have. Live like you have one because it's not guaranteed.
