I'm fairly sure someone who had an exam in the auditorium on the ground floor of Uris Hall picked up my black iPhone 3GS yesterday... please please please turn it in to CUPD if this is you. I can cook you dinner or help you with a paper or even mow your lawn. I can get rid of the house centipede infestation in your apartment. I also possess an uncanny volume of plant knowledge, so I can heal your sick houseplants. In other words, pleasepleasePLEASE turn it in :'(
