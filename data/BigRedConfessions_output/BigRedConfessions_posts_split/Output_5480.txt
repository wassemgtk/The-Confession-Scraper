I kept running into this girl for a while, and last week I decided to ask her out. It was the best decision of the semester, by far. She is quite amazing, and I regret not getting to know her sooner. I hope that the summer vacation doesn't destroy or diminish what we could have; it would be a shame to lose someone so sweet.
