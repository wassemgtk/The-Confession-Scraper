Sometimes I feel as if I don't deserve my boyfriend. It's a running theme whenever I'm super drunk, which hasn't happened often. He's just one of those brilliant and friendly people who can get along with anyone. Everyone just loves him. Meanwhile I'm the shallow judgmental mediocre bitch who sits in the corner. We share a similar friend/acquaintance  group and I know that most people only know of me through him. He's so much more attractive than I am. And sometimes I think the only reason I think we ever got together is because I'm his first relationship. He was extremely shy and I was the only one of us confident enough to make the first move. I  know he loves but I can't help but feel he probably deserves someone who is actually on his level.
