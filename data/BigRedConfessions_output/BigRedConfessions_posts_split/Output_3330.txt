I like my friends here; they're all really fantastic. I like our late night chats when we open up about things below the surface. I just wish for more. I know it's an idiotic and impossible thing to wish for but it's so hard to go from a group of friends who have 10 years of memories and bonding to a friend group that has had 6 months. I want to be super comfortable around them and speak my mind and never feel like I'm a burden or that I'm pushing the limits of our fragile bond. Instead, I speak carefully and hope that soon, this wonderful group of people will become family just like the wonderful group of people back home became family.
