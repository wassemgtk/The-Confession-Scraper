"I've never been this close to completely breaking down since I first fought depression in  high school. I just had the brutal realization that so many people that I considered as friends don't actually give a shit about me, and accept my help and encouragement while providing none in return. They're so selfish, it sickens me, especially when I do my best to help them.

In this time when I'm struggling with my classes and losing sleep trying to understand their content, these people's only concern seems to be that they come out on top, or at least succeed better than me. Very few people understand and appreciate me, and I take solace in them, but it still breaks my heart that my others ""friends"" have been so unsupportive. I've pretended for so long that everything was fine, and that worked for a long time, but now I'm breaking. I don't know what to do."
