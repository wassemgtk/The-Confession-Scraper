I'm a girl whos always been into guys, but I fell in love with a girl last year and my life has taken an 180 since then. I've lost friendships, my family bonds are ruined, and I've done a lot of things im not proud of. I am in love with her but sometimes I wish I could go back to the time before I met her, and I feel so guilty for feeling that way. I've just had to sacrifice so much in order to be with her. Not one person at Cornell knows about my girlfriend back home because I dont want to be labeled as "gay". I honestly don't think I am, but obviously if I tell people I'm with a girl they will assume that. I'm so confused.
