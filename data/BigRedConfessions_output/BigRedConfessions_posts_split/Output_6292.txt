Starting to think I need a new set of friends.  I text all of you from freshmen year does anyone wanna go to this event or that event or hang out, etc and no one ever responds.  The least you could do is say no if you're busy or just not even interested.  Don't just ignore it completely so I wait around wondering if anyones coming.
