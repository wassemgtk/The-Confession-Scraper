I'm the kind of guy who likes to think of everything in terms of math. I like to believe that if you aggregate all the qualities of someone, you get some number. And I like to believe that this number is generally fixed (e.g. someone who is good at one thing has weaknesses in another area). That's why whenever I see someone who is amazing at something compared to myself, I instinctively feel the need to find out what they are not good at. This is terrible, I know. I can easily recognize when someone's good at something, but I feel the need to justify to myself why they aren't perfect. I apply this same analysis to myself. I like to believe that I am a strong STEM student but struggle in the liberal studies. This is why I have been content my entire life not getting perfect grades in liberal studies classes. Conversely, I have taught myself to not tolerate anything other that As in STEM classes. By following this system, I have been able to remain confident in my abilities and focus on perfecting them while not acting phony in areas I'm naturally weak in. But this system is dangerous. If I do poorly on a STEM assignment (and I assume that I haven't gained an appreciable skill in another area), I automatically assume that I am a deficient person in that my friends and colleagues and those around me have something they are consistently good at, something which defines them, while I don't. STEM defines me and without my proficiency in these subjects, I don't know who I am. I feel as though my existence is so fragile. I need to desperately find something else that I'm good at because if I happen to now do well in STEM, then I honestly don't know what kind of person I am.
