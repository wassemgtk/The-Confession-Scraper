I've been having this recurring dream every couple weeks since coming to Cornell.  In it, I'm lying in bed and check the winning lottery tickets on my phone and realize all five numbers and the multiplier  (numbers I've picked based on my birthday, my gf's birthday, and our anniversary) on my ticket match the drawing numbers.  Immediately I feel a sense of freedom and relief and get up and start packing up my room without telling anyone.  I go down to the car dealership and buy a 2015 Ford Mustang.  I've never really liked that car but why not?  I can do whatever the fuck I want, so I pack up my car and hit the road.  I begin the 3,000 mile drive to Los Angeles in a state of pure happiness, knowing that for the first time in my life I don't have to worry about finances or what I'm going to make of my life.  I don't have to take classes I don't want to take because I need to maximize my return on investment.  I don't have to feel guilty for not taking absolute advantage of every opportunity here.  I don't have to feel guilty when my parents let me know that there isn't any money for me to come home.  I don't have to deal with the condescending shits in Day Hall.  I don't have to pretend to care about this place.  I can just be.  I've never felt so liberated or limitless as I do in this dream.

But then I wake up and realize that it was all a figment of my imagination, that I'm still here and my parents are still back west basking in the sunshine and drowning in a sea of debt.  And immediately I feel useless and alone and ungrateful and lazy.  I realize like I do every morning that I should get used to this because I'll be working some 9-5 job until I'm sixty-five and I have a fat enough retirement fund so I can enjoy my last twenty years of old age and think about all the shit I'll regret not being able to do.  But I'll probably put a bullet in my head before then so I guess I don't really have to worry about that.

I want so badly to slip away from this place in the middle of the night without anyone ever realizing I was here and move west so I can live a life of ease and happiness, but I know deep down that that will never happen.  So for now I'll continue to trudge through the snow on my way to my 9 am classes and hope that someday this all pays off.  I'll keep pretending that deep down I want to be some hoity-toity businessman because I don't really have many alternatives.  And every day I'll die a little bit more inside but I'll continue to cling to the hope that I can work things out.  I don't know what to do when that runs out though.
