I keep trying, I've been pushing myself into everything I can, but it only gets lonelier and lonelier. I've gone back to avoiding locking eyes with anyone, so you can't tell that the life in them is gone. Somehow I've only regressed to the state I used to be in, hurt too much to care and demotivated beyond anything. And counseling lately has been outright pointless. So it's back to isolation, once again. Just me and my pain.
