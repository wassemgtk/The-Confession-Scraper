To #7583: 
There are other furries near/at Cornell, we just don't advertise it because we understand that publicly acknowledging that sort of thing means our job prospects and networks will fly out the window. 
That said it would be interesting to meet others. 

For all the other curious people out there, I would also like to note that being a ""furry"" does not necessarily have to include sexual stuff. Some furries just like roleplaying themselves (non-sexually) online as a fursona (an animal representation of them) or just dressing up in a fursuit to hang with friends and have fun. "
