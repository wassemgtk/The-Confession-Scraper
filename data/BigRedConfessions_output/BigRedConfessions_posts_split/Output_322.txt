I feel guilty about not making an effort to hang out with the other students from my country, but I honestly don't have much in common with most of them. They tend to clump together far too much, and I didn't move to a whole different culture to only hang out with people from my country. But every time I pass other international students talking in their native languages, I feel like I'm missing out on something.
