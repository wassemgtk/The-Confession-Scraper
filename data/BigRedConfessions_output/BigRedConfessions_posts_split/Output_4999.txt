"I dont know what's going on... It
loops inside my head. Everyday,
Lucifer visits to haunt me...why? I
understand i've done wrong and
many others have commited sins.
Incrimination seems to be its goal.
Needless to say, my family 
abhor such presence as members trusting the sayings of Jesus....
Interesting... It talks of a message.."
