I met a girl who I think I really like and am very compatible with. She's a hell of a lot smarter than me, yet still makes me feel like I'm interesting (and laughs at my jokes lol). But my last "thing" ended very badly and I lost a pretty great friendship with her because of it. I'm not afraid to ask them out, nor am I afraid of rejection; but I am worried that I'll lose a potentially awesome friend if things don't work out, like last time. Both of those relationships (good friends, or partners) don't come around that often for me. So I don't want to fuck this up again lol.
