I've been really sad lately and don't know what to do. Sometimes I'm so tempted to find out how it would be to be with my dad, wherever he is. But I know that my mom's heart would break if she had to go to my funeral. I thought I had a good support system here, but it seems like my friends either don't realize or don't care that I'm starting to get sad all the time. I don't know what to do anymore.
