"So, I posted the form and we got problems. There are like 12 legit responses in a sea of trolls (only one hilter though) but only 5 of the 12 had contact information and two of those were friends referring each other (so like, wtf, i can't contact both of you...) and I googled one of the phone numbers and uh... you're a dude. and you also have a second facebook profile which looks really fricking weird associated with your phone number and why do people make fake profiles anyway?

But I'll probably contact the other two of you sometime soon. The 7 of you that didn't know google forms were anonymous all sound very nice but I don't know who you are.

Edit: of the five, two dudes, two girls referring each other, and an email address. blind date form, email address is a dude too. 0 legit responses.
