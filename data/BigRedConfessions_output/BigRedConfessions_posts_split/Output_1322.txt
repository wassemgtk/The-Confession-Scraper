I am trying to get a health leave of absence for the semester, but my biggest concern is that I will have to pay back all of the tuition I got in aid, which was around 20k for this semester.  Needless to say, I don't have 20k, so the amount I have to pay back is the biggest factor in whether I decide to go on leave or not.  

So I called up financial aid and asked this question, and the woman told me "We can't tell you anything until we know the leave date." Are you f******* kidding me.  Can anyone who has gone on a health leave of absence, didn't have tuition insurance, and is here on financial aid please tell me how much of it you had to pay back?  The fact that even with an overpaid and underworked army of staff here I can't have simple questions answered is supremely frustrating.
