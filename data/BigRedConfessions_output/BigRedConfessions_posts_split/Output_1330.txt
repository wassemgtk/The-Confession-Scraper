College itself doesn't have to be hard. There are those teachers who make it hard by giving you work prior to teaching it, and then making it count for a large percentage of your grade. That's a cheap way of making it seems like class is hard--it's not, only your way of giving work is. If teachers taught the subject first, then gave work based on it, we'd all be happy. I know that every course is accelerated because so much material must be given in the span of 3 months, but that doesn't mean a teacher has to give us, say, a problem set on crap they won't cover for another week and expect it done when we're still in the middle of the material. Great...I learn how to do every problem set after I hand it in. What a great representation of my capabilities as a student.
