As a closeted gay guy, it's really hard to find guys that are of "good quality". What I mean by good quality is someone with a great personality, someone that can make me smile, laugh and loves to talk, drink wine and listen to Adele (now Adele 25). For me that's an ideal man. But... since I am closeted, I have had no choice but to get into Grindr, a hookup app for gay men. 

On Grindr, you find all sorts of guys, but it's a hookup app (mainly for sex; rarely for dating) and it's hard for me to find someone (or at least get a taste of someone) that is what I am really looking for. Don't get me wrong... I have met both good and bad guys from Grindr. Some of them were cold (just wanted to come and go), some of them weren't intimate enough and some other were amazing!!!!!!, such as the guy I recently met. 

But... it's still not what I'm looking for. I feel disgusted after hooking up with some guys. I feel this is not really me doing this and sometimes I feel that I do it not because I have the desire, but the impulse of actually doing it (not sure if I am clear). Like... I don't do it because I want to get off (I prefer masturbation over Tumblr videos than a cold encounter from Grindr). I don't really know why I do it. I log in into the app and chat with some people, and things happen. But I don't like how I feel after encounters; this makes me realize that I am not the hookup type. 

What do I do then? I am a closeted gay guy. I have tried to tell some of my friends but it's hard. In fact, I told one of my sisters, and she didn't believe me until I actually had to describe her some of my encounters and what gay guys ""do"". I am nervous, anxious, happy, sad, strong,weak, etc all at the same time when it comes to this business. But good thing is that I have already promised myself that I won't hide it if someone comes and asks me (no one has asked me whether I am gay or not), so if you think you know who I am, come and ask me. I will tell you the truth. This will help me a lot and make me more confident.

I will appreciate if some of you leave some tips on how should I proceed with this. I really want to come out before my senior year so that I can have really fun memories before graduation and find a SO.
