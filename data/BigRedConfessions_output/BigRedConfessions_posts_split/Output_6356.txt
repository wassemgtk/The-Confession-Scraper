Hello my black eye candy,
 
I’ve been admiring you since June. I’ve been through all of your fb pictures and boy oh boy I wanna rail you. Usually I’m conservative but you make me feel like a grown woman with needs and not like the virgin I am. I see your face everywhere, even in this one Korean man I like. So please swag please, take away this burden I carry in my nether regions of virginity.
 
Pop my cherry and I’ll lick your saltshaker and grapes.
