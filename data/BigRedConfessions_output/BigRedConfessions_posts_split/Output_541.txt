I am glad I got out of upstate NY and went to live in Pennsylvania after graduating where I now work. Pennyslvania is a much better state in that taxes are lower and the business regulations are less stringent. The state has been home to many great firsts like the grand and renowned Pennsylvania Railroad which transported people between New York, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., and Harrisburg on it's electrified rail. The system that was build about 100 years ago and electrified in the 1930's is still operating moving people between these major cities in a very efficient manner utilizing energy sources that are high quality and non-intermittent such as coal, natural gas, and nuclear fission. Pennsylvania has a neat energy mix that provides for a low-cost, strong energy grid that is not only capable of supplying electricity to the state, but also to nearby population centers, in New York City, New Jersey, and Maryland under the PJM grid which is tied to the NY state grid. NYS is too reliant on moving towards renewable energy sources such as solar and wind, which at higher quantities could derail the NY energy grid.
