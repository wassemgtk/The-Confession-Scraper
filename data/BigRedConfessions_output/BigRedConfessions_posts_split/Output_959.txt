I graduated in engineering at Cornell coming from a poor family and being the first one in my family to go to high school and graduate college. I still talk simple or like I "come from the slum" according to the way people giggle when I talk to them. They don't consider me educated in any way. My family has no connections to really help me with jobs and I have not had one job interview since I graduated in engineering. I also don't have any real friends from my time at Cornell because it was hard for me to adjust to the environment here because a lot of people come from far more wealthier families than I do and I have trouble adapting to people's lifestyles. For instance I did not understand the resources that were available to me as a college student being first gen. I had to work long hours to support myself and to do well in school so I did not have much time for socializing either. The only job interview I recieved was to be a manual construction worker which I have accepted as I have no other choice and need to pay back some of my loans and sustain myself. It's back breaking work but I hope one day I can move up the ranks and become a foreman or supervisor. I now realize how hard life is to move up social classes even though I graduated from Cornell rising out of poverty. At least maybe one day I could help my children if I decide to have any, with either going to school and finding a job or finding something out of high school. Some nights I cry about the fact that I've wasted my time at Cornell as I had no direction in life since my parents did not have any advice to offer about college or high school. My guidance counselor told me going to college was the best thing to do...I guess not.
