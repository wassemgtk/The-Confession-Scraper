I LOVE kids movies and tv shows. I will voluntarily watch Arthur, Spongebob, Strawberry Shortcake, Disney, etc over shows like Breaking Bad and Game of Thrones. It would be the best day ever to just spend the day watching Rugrats with gummy snacks and cheetos instead of going to Chem, doing research, going to parties, etc. Maybe I'm looking for mindless stress relief...or maybe I feel like I'm growing up too fast. Does anyone else feel this way??
