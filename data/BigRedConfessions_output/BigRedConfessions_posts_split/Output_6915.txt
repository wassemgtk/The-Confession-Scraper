It bothers me when people sit in the front of a lecture just to talk. I mean some of us want to learn what's going on. If you wanna chat, chat but at least whisper or go to the bak  of the class. Do you guys actually just not realize everyone keeps looking at you every time you open your mouths? Gosh!
