Seriously. I know you're not the worst person, but I can't stand your stubborn personality and your annoying voice. Why do you always have to be "right"? Why can't you just accept that you're wrong? You keep on finding excuses as to why you're "right." I just can't stand it. I know students here have grown up being "right" most of the times, but you've got to learn to gracefully accept when you're wrong. You keep on judging people and dragging me down with your negativity. I just wish you could find your peace so that I can stop being so annoyed with you.
