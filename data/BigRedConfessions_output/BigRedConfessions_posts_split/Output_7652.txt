"I've started calling this university an institution. It's always the same: wake up, go to class, study, take exam, fail exam, struggle with friendships and competitiveness, work through endless reports and papers and problem sets, try to make some money, repeat. It's just a cycle of hopelessness and inevitable failure. 

Ezra, I hope you know that your ""any person, any study"" has turned into an institution where the CAPS office is overbooked and over 70% of the students struggle with some form of mental instability because of school. "
