"It's funny… you build someone up to be a better person than they ever could have imagined to be, give them everything they could want, and help them be confident enough to open up to the world… and then it ends, you are left behind, wishing you had never helped them and wondering what you could have been if you put all that effort in yourself. 

Thanks for nothing."
