Hey you, guess what? I still like you! A lot! I know we've discussed not dating each other, or rather you expressed not wishing to date me and instead just staying as friends, and I finally became fine with it at the beginning of the summer. But we hung out a lot over the summer, and now you have ruined me perfectly. All I can think about is you. I really want to know whether you still feel that we won't be good as a couple. Why not? Why can't we date each other? What's so wrong about us?
