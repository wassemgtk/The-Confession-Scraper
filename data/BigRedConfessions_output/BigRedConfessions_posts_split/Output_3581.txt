As a result of all the plane accidents in the past years and my parents flying to an Asian country in the next few months, we sat down and talked about what would ever happen in the event that their flight should go down and I would be on my own. Even though it was all hypothetical and said with the best intentions so that I would know what to do if I were truly on my own, I couldn't bear to sit through the whole conversation. When we finished I cried in my room for about 30 minutes over the possibility that I someday I might be without my parents.

I know that at times we find our parents annoying, overbearing, and heck they  make mistakes too, but love and cherish your parents.
