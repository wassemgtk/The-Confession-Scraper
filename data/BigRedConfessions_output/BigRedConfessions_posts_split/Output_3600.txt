Dear admin: why don't you advertise for new people to take your role on this page? I'm sure there are plenty of people who would be willing to update the page a lot faster so we're not still catching up on posts from a month ago, before winter break...

Admin: Good idea! We actually have room for two more admins!
If you would like to be an admin for this page, please message us with your year, major, what you like/dislike about this page, and a funny movie that doesn't feature Seth Rogen.
