FightTheFee comes off to me like a bunch of sad rich kids co-opting the real struggle of people on financial aid 'cause they're sad they were in high school when Occupy Wall Street was big.  I don't see people genuinely concerned about the financial burden--can we get waivers?  Can it be assigned in a way that insurance might cover it?--I see people using Three Hundred and Fifty Dollars as a way to further a childish vendetta against the institution they're paying to attend.
