Today I got a phone call from my parents that my dog got run over by a bus since he ran away from my house a couple of days ago. My mom was trying to hold off telling me because she knew I had an exam today. After the exam I received the sad news. I don't know what to do since my dog was my true best friend. I literally have no people to talk to here as I am a first semester freshman who could help me through this. My mom works 2 jobs so I don't really have anyone else to talk with. I wish someone could help me because every time I think about it I wish that a motor vehicle just hit me so hard that I would not even feel it. I failed that exam miserably too so I am at the lowest point in my life currently and don't really know what to do besides write something here to try to take some stress and anxiety from the situation away. I am afraid that if I talk to Gannett I will be forced to take medication and I don't want to take antidepressants. :(
