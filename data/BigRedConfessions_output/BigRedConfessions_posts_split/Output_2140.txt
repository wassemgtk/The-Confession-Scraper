I do talk to you - when I can't avoid it!  But otherwise, I clam up!!!  I can't help it. You just seem like an awesome person, and I don't know why, but I get nervous.  I thinks because I have a track record of doing embarrassing things, and I don't want to add another one to my list as a result of interacting with you. But maybe I should just go for it!  Who cares, right???  Embarrassing stories are the best, amiright?
