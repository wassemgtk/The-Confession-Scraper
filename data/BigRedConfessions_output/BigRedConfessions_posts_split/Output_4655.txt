I think it's really funny when guys talk about how slutty girls are at Cornell compared to the real world. I hope they know that girls are all slutty at their own schools and just act like good girls for dates. My friends that are girls from state schools all do the same shit.. It's easy when we're paying for the meals bro

[how bout not slut-shaming girls at all bro]
