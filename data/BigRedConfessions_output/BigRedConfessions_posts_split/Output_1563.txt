I used to have nightmares that Filch's cat (from Harry Potter) was an Animagus who was forcibly trapped by Filch into a cat's form. Poor witch was probably lured, seduced, and left to live out the rest of her days at the mercy of the wretched lecher, who took on the identity of the unassuming caretaker of Hogwarts to avoid any suspicion. I'm telling you, Filch is a sick, sick man. He's worse than Voldemort.
