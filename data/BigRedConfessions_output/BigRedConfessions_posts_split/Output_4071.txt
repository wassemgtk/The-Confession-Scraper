"Disclaimer:  Some language in the beginning and end may be offensive, but I decided to just write what came out. No censorship, so don't think poorly of me. Oh wait, you can't!  It's anonymous!  HA

WHY DO PERFECT GUYS ALWAYS GO FOR SKANK WHORES??????  Like, why?  And why do they stay with them???? Like, why?  Like, I’m a cool person.  Can’t you see that I’m a million times cooler??  I know you do.  I just don’t get why you stay with her.  I’d do just the same things with you (you know what I mean), except I’m classier, and smarter, and I get your stupid humor, and I know when you’re joking even though it seems like I don’t…  I’m sarcastic and like to bust chops, I know the difference between “your” and “you’re,” and I fucking love it when you say “yeaaaahhhh” like you said you said it in high school with your stupid dumb friends.  But you weren’t stupid cause you were like number four in your class.  AND SO WAS I.  That alone, the fact that we were the same rank in our respective classes, should show you that you and me, we belong, we belong, we belong togetthhhhherrrrrr.  WEEEEEE BELONG.  Basically, I’ve gotten to know you fairly well over the past couple years, at school and work, and you’re one person I’d like to keep getting to know for however long you’d want to keep getting to know me.  I don’t move fast, but that makes things goooood.  Good as honey that actually crystallizes.  Damn, that’s a good analogy.  See???????  I’m SMART.  I’M AT GODDAMN CORNELL AND I’M FUNNY.  I MAKE YOU LAUGH AND I KNOW IT!  YOU LOVE SEEING ME AND YOU SHOW IT!  THAT FUCKING BRILLIANT SMILE IN YOUR EYES, EVEN WHEN THE REST OF YOUR FACE ISN’T SMILING.  I LOVE IT.  I don’t know if I love you, per say, but things like that, words spoken like that, take time to grow into.  You know it as well as I.  I just wish you’d take the time with me.  Take the time with me.  Spend the time with me.  We live two minutes apart.  And when we’re at school, when you visit upstate, you visit me!  Visit me!  I’ll show you Cornell and bring you cool places!  And I can ride the bus from Ithaca to New York, and from New York to your school!!  And you’ll show me your school and all of its hoodish glory… But seriously, I’d love to see it with you.  I’d love to walk down the street holding your hand.  I’d love to actually hug you, rather than think about doing it on the last day of at our place of employment if our employers weren’t there.  Or at least shake your hand.  Seriously.  Annnd.  You’re tall.  And I’m tall.  And our hands would be at the perfect height for each other for holding.  

Also, the only reason I know you would see this is if you were stalking Cornell Confessions to see if I’ve posted anything.  And if you were doing that, that’s just to say you’re in love with me and should date me instead of that skank whore.  

I’m just kidding around.  I’m sure she’s a cool person and has a great personality.  

But I’m better.
