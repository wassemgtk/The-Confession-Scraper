"There are three of us here from my high school. One is graduating early with over a 4.0 GPA.
The other is winning a bunch of awards for leadership, service, excellence, etc etc.

And me? I'm struggling just to pass my classes each semester, I'm not involved with nearly as many clubs as I'd like to be, and I've done absolutely nothing of importance with my life. It takes everything I have just to avoid jumping off the fucking bridge. I'm such a failure.

[Nah, dude. You're doing the best you can, you can't compare yourself to others because they didn't have the same upbringing, experiences, etc. as you. Do the best you can, try and jump in a lab or get some work experience under your belt before you graduate. Believe me, Cornell is tough, and I'm graduating in the same boat as you. As long as you have solid goals after graduation and work towards it, you're golden. Stay strong]
