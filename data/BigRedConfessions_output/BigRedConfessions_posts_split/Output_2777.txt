So much to confess: 1. I hate Facebook because it makes me jealous of everyone- everyone who seems to have a richer and more interesting life than me 2. I am proud to be who I am but it seems like I am losing track these days. I fight so hard to fight for my convictions but then in the end I am a sellout like everyone else 3. I am scared I will die being someone who is so me- completely mediocre, completely average, completely normal, without achieving anything or doing something epic. 4. I can't believe I am going to be graduating soon. Feels like I just got here, still not over the initial Ithaca hatred phase. 5. I wish I had made or could make an effort to get to know more people, make more friends, hangout and visit the local places downtown, find people to jam with, find someone who would teach me how to play the guitar... I am afraid it's going to be too late, but I just suck at talking to people
