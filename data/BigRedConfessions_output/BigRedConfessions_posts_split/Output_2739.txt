I haven't committed to going to Cornell yet, but I'm confused. I love that Cornell has a great education and it's ivy league - but that shouldn't be the only reason I'm going right? I want to go somewhere warm and urban.. where there are a lot of things to do like going clubbing, seeing concerts, meeting new people who aren't just from the same school as you! I mean..Cornell is beautiful, but I just don't know if it's for me. I want to make the right decision, how do I make the right decision?
