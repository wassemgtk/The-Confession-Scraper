TIL that I have to enter credit card information to use Pokemon Bank even though I don't want to use it beyond the trial period, just so I can transfer everything to Pokemon Bank, restart, and get a Bulbasaur and Tyrantum this time around for Pokemon Y. Damn.
TIL that some "free wifi" locations around the city don't actually have the web protocol necessary for me to use Pokemon Bank. Consequently, I will now have to pay 1.95 to buy a Starbucks coffee to sit in there and play Pokemon Y on my 3DS
