My old friends find it funny when I physically stumble and trip at the oddest of places. I laugh it off too but secretly it makes me want to cry. It wasn't like this last year. But this time, I feel utterly lost. I was the one picking anyone up, no matter how heavy they (or their burden was) were. And now I can't even walk straight.
