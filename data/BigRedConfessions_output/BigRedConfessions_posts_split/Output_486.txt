For once, I did everything right. And Valentine's Day was...well, damn near perfect. For both of us. Yet, for some reason, you insist on remaining friends. Even after all of that gushing, and looking flushed/flustered, and smiling and joking and kissing and groping and carrying, and eating and being and kissing and chilling and seeing, and talking and kissing and snuggling and rubbing and learning and walking and kissing and flirting...you insist. I'll never fully understand you. 

You said it yourself: "I want you but I refuse to be with you." Please just explain the disconnect between these two statements.

Is there something I don't know that you don't want to tell me? Is there something you think I've done to you? Is there something you're afraid of? We went from 100% honesty to cryptic, ambiguous messages and we did it so quickly.

I'm fine, like I said I'd be. But I will always want to know. I will always be here to listen. I will always wonder...why?

I won't force you to do anything you don't want. In fact I can't. But don't I at least deserve to know why?
