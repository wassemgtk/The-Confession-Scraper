"Blacks are more racist than whites." So I've heard. But here's where the argument fails. It's hard to discriminate on race if you are in the minority. If a minority is "racist", it is most likely linked to the fact that the racism from the majority has caused it. But even then, if a minority is "racist", WHO GIVES A FUCK? He or she is generally not in a position to use their racism to OPPRESS. Notice the difference? It's not like these same black men and women you accuse of being racist can use their racial positions to hold other races down or skew the system to their favor. That's the problem with the "reverse racism" argument.

[Admin: Even if there isn't an opportunity to oppress, racism still hurts. One awful comment or one little stereotype can cause so, so much harm to a person's psyche]
