I'm a freshman and I've known this girl for at least 5 years, she went to the high school a town over from me. She's perfect in every way except one: she's in a long distance relationship. I'm madly in love with her, seeing her makes my day a million times better. We got very flirty after a night out, but that quickly ended since I couldn't get myself to try and make her cheat. I'm waiting for the day for her to be single, but in the meantime I don't know what to do. We're so close and all I want is to be with her, and I know she knows that because every time I get drunk I tell her. I just wish she would break up with him already and give me a chance.
