"As a Republican I feel it is necessary for people, Democrats and Independents, to hear the opinion of the silent majority of our party. 

The Republican party isnt looking for hate and the loud guy, who cant make up his mind about which party he's part of. The guy who has no principles. 
So to the Republicans, next time you hear- ""just give in to trump"", "" trump will be the nominee"" , ""the year of the anti-Establishment election"" PLEASE call out the crap out, and set the story straight.

And to those Democrats and Independents- who, are indifferent, dont like or despise the Republican party, realize who the people of the party really wants and DOESNT want. 65% is alot of the party. Also realize that WE WONT just give into him just because hes leading, we are fighting the good fight.
