I feel called to spend my life with a woman of God, to get married and start a family.  Right now that's my biggest concern, though I do want a job to support that goal.  Experience tells me she'll be loving and very caring, but also passionate in and out of the bedroom (even before marriage).  If she were to read this right now, I'd tell her that I'm looking and praying for her, and someday, I've got a lot of love to give her.
