"So when I asked if you wanted to eat waffles at Waffle Frolic for dinner, it didn't even cross my mind that it sound like I was asking you out on a date. And I'm pretty sure you thought it was a date because you replied, ""let's just have a 'friendly' hangout at CTB"". 

UGH! I really wanted to let you know I wasn't asking you out, but I can't tell you THAT because that would just seem awkward and make you think I'm just covering my tracks or something. If I was going to ask you out, I'd do it in person or at least over the phone, not through some impersonal text message. 

All in all, I just really wanted to eat waffles with you as a friend. "
