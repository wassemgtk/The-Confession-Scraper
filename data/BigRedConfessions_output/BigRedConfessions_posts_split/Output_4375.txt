You have some amazing timing. Honestly speaking here, if you never messaged me, I could have been over all this. I could have been happy right now. But now you are right there, back in my head, and no matter what I do, I can't get you out, when that's all I want to do. Yesterday I thought I finally came to grips with the way I feel, and even with you trying to return in a place you clearly can't fit, I could somehow find a way to deal with everything I am going through . But yesterday, I didn't wake up with the first thought in my head being that I love you.
