Ugh. I messed it up. You showed some interest and I withdrew. I've never been in a relationship before and I pulled away because I was scared and overthink things. I know I was gone for a while and we don't see each other anymore. I want to say I miss seeing you around, but I'm too shy to reach out and tell you.
