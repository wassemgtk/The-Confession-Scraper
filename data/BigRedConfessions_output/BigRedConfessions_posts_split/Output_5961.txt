After we got to know each other for a year, I confessed to you, albeit somewhat awkwardly as an inexperienced girl would, and you friend-zoned me as a guy who might be out of my league would. So we hung out as friends would for another year, getting to know each other more, and now I'm getting the sense that you like me. Our mutual friends seem to have picked up on it too, making jokes and doing things like changing seats just so we can sit together when we all hang out. Yet, you haven't confessed or made any major moves, and I don't have the confidence to ask if we're more than just friends to each other. What to do? Am I just giving myself false hope?
