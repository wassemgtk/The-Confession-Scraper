re: #5498:

i challenged myself quite a bit when i was at cornell. and now that i've graduated, my main regret is that i didn't challenge myself more. once you leave the hill, your grades aren't that relevant (except for maybe that first year or so). but what you learn at cornell? that's gonna last you a lifetime. do what you can while you're there, and then do more.
