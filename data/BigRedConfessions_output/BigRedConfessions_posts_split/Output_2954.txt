I have friends and loneliness is not an issue partially because I am an extreme extrovert--an outlier of all sorts. However, there are times when I wonder how this nomadic sort of social lifestyle affects the extent/ depth of relationships I am able to have. I seem to float around and people in the outer circles of my social life perceive this as my being able to making friends so easily with so many people. I do have a base group from freshmen year that I feel at home with, who have always been there and who I truly love as family. I don't know if any non-extroverts would understand this but part of this characteristic means friend zoning literally every person I meet. Even if someone is nice looking or potentially someone I would date, I figure maintaining friendships would mean a longer relationship, which I prefer over a relationship that could potentially sour.. so yes I am friends with many, many people. I'm just wondering...is this an extrovert problem or is it just me?
