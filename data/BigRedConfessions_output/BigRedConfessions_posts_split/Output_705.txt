I'm all for free speech but can we please cut down on all the Reaganite/Trumpite/"I love coal" posts? I would hazard a guess that many of them aren't being posted by Cornell students as evinced by their homogeneous nature. There aren't any posts rabidly supporting Sanders or Clinton and, while the conservative tirades do provide some comedic relief, they're not a Cornell Confession.
