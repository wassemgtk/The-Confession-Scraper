I'd like to live long enough to see every fraternity and sorority in this country closed. No other environments come anywhere near Greek systems in terms of condoning bullying, alcohol abuse, sexual harassment and assault, and yes, racial stereotyping. The ugliest sides of humanity should not be tolerated at institutions that were purportedly established to educate. Administrations would do well to focus a little more on providing good opportunities for focused, interested students than on covering up for people who decide to treat their university like an alcoholic's summer camp.
