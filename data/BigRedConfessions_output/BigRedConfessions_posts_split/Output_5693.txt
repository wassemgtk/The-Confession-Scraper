I had a pretty chill, yet eventful slope day. I ran into 80% of people that I know, tied up some loose ends, found out that people I thought hated me were okay with me, and took some hits. By the end of the concert, I ended up chilling at a friend's house talking to one of his friends from back home. I was laying on the couch, probably coming on a little too strong from the liquid courage, talking to this girl. And she was sooooo chill, and insightful. I didn't want to smash at all, and that's not me saying that to avoid sounding like all those other guys. But it was just so serene. Just talking. Two people understanding each other on a deeper level than a game of pong or grinding to a song would usually do. I miss talking to people without me thinking in the back of my head "what if they expect something of me and I fail?" or some shit. That moment really gives me hope for the future, for smiles, for love. I dipped afterwards bc the grass started making me feel unsettled af, but I hope I can meet more amazing people like that. If you had a dope ass, memorable Slope Day I salute yo ass; keep growing y'all!
