so, i got an internship at a prestigious institution but just cant help to feel that i dont deserve it. i dont feel qualified and i definitely do not feel prepared or even skilled. F!
i mainly applied to internships as an "alright, maybe." i did it to impress someone, with high hopes of getting into a good one, as to "woo" him. 
i no longer talk to this someone and i definitely feel like shit. 
i do not know what to do.
