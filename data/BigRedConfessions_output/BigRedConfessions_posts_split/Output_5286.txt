"I struggled with depression and loneliness all year. I tried to kill myself in the fall. I would sit in my room all day. I hated my body and my personality. I didn't eat. I ate, then I purged. I drank. I drugged. I missed classes. I missed deadlines. I let people down. I let myself down.

I went to Gannett. I got the treatment I needed. I repaired relationships. I found new friends. I dated. I stopped using drugs. I stopped drinking. I learned to love myself. I accepted my body. I beat 2048. I passed all of my classes, and was prepared to accept failure.

At any point throughout this year, I would have said that I hated it at Cornell. But today, I realize that this year prepared me for the challenges of life more than anything else ever could have.
