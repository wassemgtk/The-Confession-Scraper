Stop lying to yourself: you still want me. Why all the fuss everytime our paths cross, lol?  Seriously, we mean nothing to each other( well,  at least you don't to me). I'm not trying to be a roadblock on your journey and you certainly can't derail mine. Your faux confidence drew me in at first, but I have seen the grime and hatred that is your heart. Just know, I will NEVER have you because I love myself way too much to be with someone like you. You should move on, not for me, but for your sake.
