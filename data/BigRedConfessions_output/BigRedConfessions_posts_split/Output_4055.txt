So I really want to have sex with this guy. He's been making what I think are advances toward me but I don't know if they're exclusively toward me or if he's just a generally flirtatious guy. Also I don't know what direction he swings so he might not even be into girls. I want to take initiative and make a move but I'm also really scared of being turned down because of how incredibly weird and awkward our dynamic will become. As cliche as this is I don't want to ruin what we already have which is this joking, touchy, and flirtatious friendship. But in some ways its actually making it worse for me because I'm getting a taste of what he could be like all the way. I'm going insane. I'm going to admit it. I'm really thirsty for this guy and I want him to quench my thirst. #noshameinthethirstgame
