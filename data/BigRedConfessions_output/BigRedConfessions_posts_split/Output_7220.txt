"I hate what you've done to me. I don't even know you that well, but I can't stop thinking about you or overanalyzing every stupid insignificant thing you do. I'm tearing myself apart for someone who could probably care less. 
Just stop. Get out of my head. Don't even look at me anymore. I can't deal."
