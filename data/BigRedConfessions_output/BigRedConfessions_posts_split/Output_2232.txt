This semester I found some truly great friends from those living around me. While I'm forever appreciative and grateful to them for befriending me and giving me an actual social circle, I really want to see more people outside of them. But hanging out with them has made me anti-social to an extreme, and because none of them would go out, neither would I. I feel horrible if I ditch this group for another, since I don't like abandoning friends and I don't like friends abandoning me, but the truth is, I don't want to be a hermit for all my college experience.
