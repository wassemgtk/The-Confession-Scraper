Its during this time of year, that I get this painful burning sensation. I know I'll always have the memories, but it stings all the same that we're all moving on with our lives and I won't see my friends till the next year. To the MECA community here at Cornell, I love you all and I wish I could tell each and every one of you how much you all mean to me.
