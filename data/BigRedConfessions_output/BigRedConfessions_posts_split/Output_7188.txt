I sometimes wish my memory was worse. Very often while working I remember a time in vivid detail when I was in elementary, middle, or high school (different places for me as I've moved around several times) playing with my friends or doing something in the area. Life is going by too fast. I cry to myself because I wish I could do all of it again.
