The group study rooms in Uris are NOT sound proof! I'm so tired of opening a door and telling someone inside that they're loud, and everyone can hear. I feel like I'm the only one who does this (for Uris anyway), but it is really annoying and it bothers me a lot. I'm starting to be less and less nice about it. If you actually want to talk loud, go to your own room or cafe.
