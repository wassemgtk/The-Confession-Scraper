I'm an incoming freshman and I'm kind of worried that people don't really drink all that much here. I'm super excited about frat parties, and I know that the vast majority of people who go to those would be drinking to some extent, but I'm kind of worried that it won't be socially acceptable for me to get pretty far gone. I love the work hard play hard lifestyle, and I'm confident that I can count on Cornell for the "work hard" half of that, but I'm also worried that I won't get to "play hard" the way I want to. Insight?
