It's weird; I feel like within my lifetime my faith in Christianity has wavered and shattered like waves. And I'm not talking about the depression, the senseless misfortune that befalls people for no cosmic reason (you can't justify misfortune for the sake of teaching people when you can just create them knowing things? Like why would a "lonely, jealous" God create beings that could "technically abandon him when these things will anger and sadden him? But then again, he knows everything, so what does it matter? If some babies intrinsically know how to doggie paddle (correct me if I'm wrong about that), I'm sure a God that can make the world in X days/years/ millenia can make it so that we aren't intrinsically jerks. 

And what about the news? I read an article about a study done by Israeli ARCHAEOLOGISTS that says the fossil record and domestication patterns of camels are askew from the accounts of the Old Testament by thousands of years? ANd the worst part is that fundamentally religion (or "faith-based lifestyles") are based on proselytizing people around you, yet religion is supposed to be this borderline taboo. How are we going to move forward as a civilization if we can't have open dialogue about things? Same goes for mental illness, rape and sexual assault; we gotta talk about these things. 

It may sound like I'm against Christianity in particular, but I just want to know the truth. If the most popular religions didn't seem like politicians trying to sway voters but hiding things from the same voters, then we'd probably be a lot closer to figuring stuff out than where we are right now.
