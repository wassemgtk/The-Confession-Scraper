To the Cornell girl that's somewhere out there that I'm waiting for: I'm a born and raised beach boy who is fluent in English and Spanish and who loves to cook. I really love the arts and music yet I'm an engineer. Our first date would be going to a concert or show and getting to know each other over an epic meal. If I sound remotely interesting, come find me, I promise you will!
