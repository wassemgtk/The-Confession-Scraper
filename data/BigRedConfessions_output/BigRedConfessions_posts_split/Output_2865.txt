Tip for patrons of Cafe Jennie: When you leave chewed gum on your plate, and then leave your plate on the table assuming it's someone's job to clean up after you, know that someone (more than likely, one of your student peers) has to, one, go get your plate off the table (when there's a clearly marked place for you to bus your own plates and silverware) and, two, has to clean your dried-on, disgusting gum off the plate.  

We are not paid to be waiters. We are not paid to clean up after you.  If you want us to pick up your plates, we're happy to begin accepting tips. Reminder: appropriate amount is minimum 15%, but for your gum, it'd probably be better to go up to at least 20%.
