I've never had a proper relationship. Sure, I've hooked up with a lot of guys, and sure, I've "been out" with a couple of guys (one turned out to be a pathological liar, and the other already had a girlfriend). Recently, a person who I considered a good friend sexually assaulted me when we were walking back from a party. I'm beginning to think it's me.
