I would love to think that confession #490 is about me. If the person who wrote it is who I think it is, there's a reason I keep trying to contact you, and you ignoring me hurts as well. I doubt I'd find you boring as you already are the most interesting person I have met, even with the little amount of time we've spent together. Stop ignoring me!
