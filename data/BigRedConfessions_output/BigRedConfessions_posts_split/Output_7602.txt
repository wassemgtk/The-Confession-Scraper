"I am sorry. I really am.
I have been an insufferable twat in the past weeks, and I was ignorant. I took you for granted. I didn't notice the signs. I didn't notice your tweets, I didn't notice your dissatisfaction with certain things.
The ""I love you""'s we exchanged were filled with disappointment and hope that maybe tomorrow will be better.
I didn't know.
I let my real life shit poison what we had going on for months. All the good we had going for us destroyed in a few weeks. All the good I had planned just gone to... nothing.
I want to tell you that I love you and that I can make you happy again. I want to prove it to you. Why aren't you letting me? Why are you pretending that you're happier now that you dumped me? Do you really not trust me, even just a little bit?
I know you are constantly distracting yourself. But you need to let your emotions take control for just a little. Love doesn't just fade away in the matter of 2 weeks.
I am just a message away from you.
And I'll wait. Not because I'm that confident in myself.
I am just that confident in our relationship."
