I have to admit that I'm pretty embarrassed to be a Cornell hockey fan this weekend. The fat chants are taking it too far. Yes, I understand we all hate Clarkson, but insulting someone's body type is not the way to go. If that's how you all really feel about people who aren't skinny, then I'm sad to call myself a Cornellian. Sure, the guy was obnoxious, but we're better than that.
