"I don't know what to do

I thought I loved you and really wanted to get married with you and have a family. Now I am not sure if I really want to anymore, you have changed a lot and I feel you care about yourself and your own good than on us. You put excuses for everything when I try to be closer to you, yet complain I don't understand you. I feel that we are not compatible enough to be together for the restof of our lives, but I need you and I depend on you. 

I dont know if end this now, or wait until we are over with college. "
