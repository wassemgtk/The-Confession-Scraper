"""Writing this I know you will understand because you are quiet and when the leaves start to fall, inevitably I will come to you in memories. Do you remember the time we played on swing sets? I pushed and you went higher and higher. I asked you what it feels like to fly with my legs firmly rooted to the ground and a lump in my throat. Maybe you could call me your forgotten lullaby, a season in the months of fall that refuses to flourish. Stay and listen for a while. These are the things that spill out when I have been away for too long. These are the things I work hard to dig into the clay soil of my weary heart where you can't see. I want to tell you that I finally understand the shift of gravity and the polarity of this spinning earth and how you and I will always keep spinning and shifting in close proximities, like the ocean tantalizingly drawing closer and away from the moon with each night that draws to an end. I understand that we will always be within an inch or so of a soft press of lips, the feel of the fabric of your button-up shirt hitched over your stomach under my wandering hands, your sighs on my collarbones. You. You, you, and only you.""

This love-letter is about this imaginary figure, a person, a lovely woman I have inside of head who I seem to love so dearly. I feel like I know everything about her, and I really want to be with her. I think of her so much that quite often I find myself writing notes, poems and love-letters for her and this is just one of them. In my mind she reads my writings for her and feels the love, but in reality, I don't even know who and where she is. Maybe I am just becoming crazy, but I really want to fall in love. I want to find her already, so she could read all of my writings for her and feel my love for her. "
