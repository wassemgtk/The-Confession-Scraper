Im going to be a senior next year and a lot has been on my mind. One thing in particular is whether or not I'm going to stay with my boyfriend after I graduate. After much contemplation, I have decided that if we are still together, graduation will not be the end of us. (Well, as long as he is okay with that). Yes, it might be hard, and yes, I'm aware there will be obsticals. But he is worth the effort.
