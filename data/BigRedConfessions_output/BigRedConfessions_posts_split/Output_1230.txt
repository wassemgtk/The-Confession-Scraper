My roommate is an engineer and is constantly working on homework/labs/problems sets, which I understand and am very impressed with. What I find issue with is how she looks down on my work because I'm a humanities major. I get that engineering is hard, but humanity majors have to read upwards of 300 pages of difficult reading a week AND put it into context with their lectures, planning all the while for the essay they know is coming. I hate that she mentions often the lack of prelims in my life, but I write papers almost every week. The one time I brought up my opinions she didn't talk to me for a week, which scares me because I don't want to end up living in a hellish nightmare of a room. But I don't know how much longer I can take her outright snobbery....
