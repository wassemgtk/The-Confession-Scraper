I really enjoy being generous and buying things for people I like (specifically girls), but I feel weird doing it without an occasion.  When one of my female friends mentions that she could really use something (usually a thing I could get for like 5 bucks on Amazon), I quickly check to see whether their birthday is coming up, but it never is.  Because how weird would it be if I just gave them what they wanted on some random day?  "Where'd you get that?"  "Oh, I just ordered it for you because you wanted it."  :/
