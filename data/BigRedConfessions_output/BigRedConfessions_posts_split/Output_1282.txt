Mental health issues plague this campus. Maybe you disagree with the extent, or maybe you haven't had much exposure to it, but it's mental health is an undisputable issue and part of the reason attending this school has so much stigma. We as students need to make a greater effort in our lives to make others feel more comfortable and happy at this school. It ultimately beneifts us all. I think we can all agree Cornell is a competitive, grueling, and oftentimes miserable environment. It's worsened when we aren't making an active effort in our daily lives to care for each other. It's worsened when we only care about ourselves and our own grades and neglect the people we encounter daily. It's worsened when we go through the motions of our daily routine in isolation and don't connect to the people around us in class, on campus, at home. Whether it's the people we live with, take classes with, or see when we go out, why not make a greater effort to make others feel heard and appreciated? Cornell is oftentimes a place where people think they don't have the time or energy to make emotional investments in other people. This is obvious in the hook up culture and in our classes when people are focused primarily on themselves and concerned with advancing themselves at the expense of other people. If we want to change campus culture, we have to change ourselves. Think about how many people you may know who are struggling but maybe are too afraid to ask for help or can't admit it at all. Think about all the times you didn't bother asking someone how they're doing or didn't make the effort to get to know someone beyond the surface level. Think about how many people struggle socially at this school, are completely alone, and may have a hard time making friends. Think about how on any given day, you may encounter someone who has contemplated suicide, feels worthless, and has nobody to talk to at our school. Take brief moments out of your day to be a friend to the people you encounter, even if you are busy. Make the emotional investment, even when it makes you uncomfortable. As idealistic as this sounds, it makes a huge difference to us all when people feel less isolated and connected to their peers. This school really needs a better community mindset and that begins with simple acts of kindness and caring for each other.
