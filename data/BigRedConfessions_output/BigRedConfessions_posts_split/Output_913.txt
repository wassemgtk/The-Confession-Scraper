There's always a reacher and a settler. I'm happy to say I have finally stopped settling after you brought nearly nothing to the table. Sometimes you only realize a situation is not what you wanted at all when you finally have the bravery to let go of it. Now all I ask is that you stop reaching for me by attempting to live peripherally in my life. Do you realize how pathetic this last stunt of yours was? All it did was reflect horribly on you and make you look desperate af. We all know you're desperate, but have some self respect and at last try and hide it. I tried to be friendly to you because I felt bad and because I suck at holding grudges, but from this point forward let us be strangers to one another. I don't know you(I don't think I ever knew you beyond the construct I had built up in my mind) and I don't want to know you.
