I walked into a Broadway show 30 minutes before it started, and every single person I saw sitting was on their phone. It was a sea of phones. It's one of the sadder things I've seen. Technology is a great tool, but we have to use it right. It's not supposed to replace basic human functions. I also think facebook has done a lot more harm than good in the world.
