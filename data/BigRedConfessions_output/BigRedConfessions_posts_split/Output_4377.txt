This is just a shout-out to my really good friend: Friend, I didn't want to say this to your face because it leads to all those unmanly, gushy, mushy shit. But I was hoping you'd see this message and we could kinda sorta have that tacit approval thing where we both acknowledge each other's...loyalty...like spartan warriors. I just wanted to say you're an awesome bro. Especially for what you did for me the other night when we went into that strip club and the manager told us to "look, but don't touch" and I end up touching her maaanny times. You're the only person ik who'd have my back in that situation and help me fight off those bouncers and run for it. You didn't leave me hangin brah. I appreciate it. And the next time you're girlfriend comes on to me? I promise I won't bang her. Cross my heart.
