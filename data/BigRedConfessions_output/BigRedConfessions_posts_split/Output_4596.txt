I was studying at Uris when behind me, I started to hear some loud and random mutterings. So looking behind me, I saw an interesting old fellow muttering and complaining to the computer screen he was sitting in front of. "There goes $12,000!" and "What is this thing in front of me! I want to see product, that's $5,000!" and "Carrots!" (or what I made out to be carrots). As his muttering continued, the thought that he must be a secretly rich accounting genius ran through my mind. Yet the alarming thing was that a part of me felt, can this weird person get out of my library, and another realized just how trained I had become at Cornell to expect to always see people, who thought and acted the way I did.
