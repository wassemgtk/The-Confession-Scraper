A message to the sisterhood and beyond:
Back in high school, I had terrible, chronic episodes of self-doubt and anxiety. I'd spend hours of my time every day worrying over boys and relationships. While fretting over questions like "Why don't boys like me???",  "Why doesn't he like me back???" and "When will I finally get a boyfriend too??" I began to lose sight of my value independent to the admiration of boys. Getting dressed up, learning how to do makeup, and forcing myself to smile with the end goal of pleasing somebody else only made me tired and more insecure about myself. 
Then, over the summer, something clicked. After cutting off ties with the boy who exploited my insecurities and lead me on, I felt something I hadn't felt in a long time: empowered. I'd finally done myself justice. I felt a sense of independence that made me look at myself and everything around me differently. I stopped caring about unearthing the campus for a relationship or trying be "pretty" so boys will like me. Fuck that, every day I make sure I'm living life for me and the people who I know love me (ie family, friends, my dog Charlie) I am more confident and sure of myself than I'd ever been previously. And, as a bonus, confidence really does attract more boys than a fragile personality and cheap smile ever will! I work hard to be the woman I am today, and that pride will carry me far. Because once you know who you are and what you will not stand being defined by, the world is your stomping ground.
My one bit of advice is, to my ladies and gents who are struggling being comfortable in their own skin, to the beautiful people who sigh looking in the mirror, know that the quality of your life is completely dependent on your mindset and attitude. Building confidence is a journey. Every day literally pick yourself up to the mirror and say out loud "I am beautiful. You are going to do great today." It may sound foolishly simple or straight up dumb, but trust me. That's how I started to become more confident. And once you say it to a physical face, you'll start to believe it in no time. And if you feel like you "fucked up" today, get some sleep and try again tomorrow. Good luck!
