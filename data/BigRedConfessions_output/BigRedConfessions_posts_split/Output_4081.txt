I've been wanting to kill myself for three years now. It's my last year here, but I just can't take it anymore. I might not end up graduating after spending four years of misery and all this money. I've tried seeking help at CAPS and talking to other people, but the depression has persistently been present. I feel stupid, lonely, and helpless. I just don't care anymore.
