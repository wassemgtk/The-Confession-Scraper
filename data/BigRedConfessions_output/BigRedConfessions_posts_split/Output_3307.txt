I'm 20 years old and for as long as I can remember I've never had a best friend. When I was in elementary school in a city, we were relatively poor and my parents were working all the time. So, that meant I had to take care of myself and my younger sister and make sure both of us got home safe right after school. So, it didn't happen then. In high school, same story different city. Well, it wasn't really a city. It was a suburban town with a rich school district. I didn't fit into the culture there so I really didn't have a best friend. I mean I talked to a couple of the guys in my classes but never like hanging out on the weekend, watching movies, etc. In retrospect, neither of us took the initiative to contact the other to hang out. When I came to Cornell, I threw myself into my studies completely. I knew coming in that I wasn't as smart as my peers. So, from the beginning, I put in extra hours to keep up(and in engineering that is probably the best way if you're not naturally gifted). I treated this as my job. I followed the same schedule week after week, semester after semester. I came close to having a best friend freshman year. In my robotic routine, this girl on my floor somehow fit herself in. She would always make sure to invite me to brunch or any other activity she was doing with the RAs. She would often come to my room to do homework, play cards, etc. Soon I realized that I was becoming too reliant on her maybe because she was the first real friend I had. I found myself falling for her hard. I tried to distance myself from her because I didn't want to get distracted from schoolwork. Soon after that, she stopped trying and things fell apart. We lost touch late freshman year. I occasionally see her around campus, but she doesn't acknowledge me and I don't say anything either(awkward, I know).
Now that I am a junior where things are leveling out, I find I have some free time and nothing to do. By no means am I saying I don't know people. I live in a pretty large apartment with a bunch of guys. But beyond the occasional "hey, how are you?" or some conversation about grades, weather, etc., (I really don't like small talk but it's such a big part of the working world that I had to adjust.) I don't really know these guys. They are all engineers and/or pre-meds who are either busy double majoring, graduating early, or just Cornell things.
Anyways, today, it just hit me that I don't have a best friend. (Do guys even have best friends?) I am by no means depressed about being lonely (after some time you get used to be alone and living in your own world). I just wonder what it's like. On bad days(like this one), I wish there was someone to talk to. I often end up hugging my pillow and falling asleep hoping tomorrow is a better day. I guess I have internalized 20 years worth of emotions and thoughts. Oh well, I'll graduate in a year and Cornell will become a blur in the memory (college really isn't that exciting. I don't know why people say it's the best time of your life).

P.S. Sorry for so many paren(theses) <--- see what I did there and also for rambling it's the start of Feb. break and I have the winter blues and once I started typing I couldn't stop.
