My friends are my life. I love them more than anything in the world. Yet, I feel resentful and miserable that none of them share the same tastes as me. I would like to branch out and make more friends but I don't know how to. So I feel trapped at times, and worthless too because I am old enough but I don't know how to be happy with myself and by myself. But I wish I wasn't angry with my friends. I feel like a bad person. :-(
