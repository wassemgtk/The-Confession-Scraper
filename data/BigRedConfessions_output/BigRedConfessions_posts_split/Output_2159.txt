I was an average student at Cornell and felt totally mediocre.  I couldn't get into the top med schools that I wanted because of my GPA and didn't get into my in state school, so I was going to have to take on more debt at a mid tier state school in the Midwest (far from family and friends, not where I wanted to be).

I just finished up my first year and I have a 3.9 GPA, am class president, and was recruited into a concurrent PhD program that will pay for the rest of med school.  There's a big fish: pond ratio skew at Cornell.  Even if you feel like a loser here, you go out into a different environment and realize you are smarter, harder working, and better prepared than you thought.  Keep your chin up!
