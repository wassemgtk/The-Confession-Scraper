"This page reminds me of junior high.  Can you just be an adult and vent to the people who annoy you?  Talk to your bitchy roommate.  Forget the guy who spurned you because he was too immature to ever be honest about his feelings and would have made you miserable anyway.  Ignore annoying FB posts...like when you see the ads and bullsh!t Buzzfeed lists advertised, you just ignore them, right?  So...how do you lose all ability to do that when it's a student and not a corporate entity spamming you?  Can we also not fight each other in the comments.  Last summer was the worst, guys.

Good luck on finals and whatnot.
