The "Overheard @ Cornell" page is getting out of hand.... I reported something earlier this year through the university bias form about a post on that group and quickly received a response with confirmation that the student was identified and being spoken to about their insensitive post. I recommend that people offended from anything at Overheard submit a form--perhaps after receiving TONS of forms something will be done...
