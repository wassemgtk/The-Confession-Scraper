Cornell should be ashamed of the worker conditions in the dishrooms. I worked in one on West for about a year and during my time there the workers in the dishrooms were all invariably immigrants who didn't speak English, incredibly elderly, retarded, or some combination of the three. They work incredibly hard all day scraping half-eaten food off people's plates in the heat and noise and get paid minimum wage for it. It's honestly the most depressing thing I've ever seen. Next time you're in a dining hall, make sure you appreciate the people who clean your dishes, because I guarantee you no matter how much you complain you would way rather just do your problem set than do that job. And if you see one, smile and say hi...you'll probably be the first person from Cornell to in years.
