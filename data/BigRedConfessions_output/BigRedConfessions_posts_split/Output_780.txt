I've always thought myself too cynical and insecure about romance to be in a relationship. This one boy in particular managed to come under my skin and to, what I thought, take all of me when he left. I was tired; I was sick of love. And yet in the moments in which I was most repelled by love did I realize I needed it the most. Love is a right that you always need to give yourself, no exceptions. And once I built myself back up did I realize that he did not take all of me; my courage made me infinite. I am now in a wonderful relationship with a boy that I like very much. He supports me and encourages me to continue to love as much as any one can. Blessed.
