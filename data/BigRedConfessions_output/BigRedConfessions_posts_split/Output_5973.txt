"Thanks for the relapse, dickhole. 
What hurts the most is that I still think you're a good person. I know your intentions are good, but I still hope you feel bad for the destruction you caused while making your path. 
I want you to know you've broken my clean streak from cutting. I want you to know that I really just want you as a friend, but I can't even do that right now because now I have this weird mix of anger and hate and trust and love (friendly, of course) towards you. I want you to feel bad for how much pain you have caused me. I want you to know how stupid I feel for giving you the benefit of the doubt again and again. 
I want you to feel awful for what you've done. You deserve to feel awful. "
