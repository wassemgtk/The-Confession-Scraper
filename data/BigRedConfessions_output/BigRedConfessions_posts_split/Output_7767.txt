I've had a crush on this guy for the past few months. In the spirit of Valentine's Day, I asked him out for coffee this weekend. He said yes. I almost threw up in nervousness. Whatever the outcome, I'm glad that I was true to myself and took the first step. Thank you Cornell Confessions, for giving me the courage to do so. Ladies, if you like somebody, go for him/her!
