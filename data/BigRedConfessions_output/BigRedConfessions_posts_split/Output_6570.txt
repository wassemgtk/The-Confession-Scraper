I regret not choosing and going by a nickname before starting college. Life would be much easier without having to repeat my name 3+ times when meeting new people. Plus, my name is very ethnic. I'm proud of my culture, but it doesn't come close to defining me, my personality, nor my interests, despite what people assume when seeing/hearing my name.
