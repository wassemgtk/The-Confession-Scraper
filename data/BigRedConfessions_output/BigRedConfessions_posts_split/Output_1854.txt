I graduated in May 2014 and I'm still unemployed... I've been to 17 interviews and I never got to a second round. The first few rejections were really dispiriting but since then I've gotten so used to it, I don't really expect anything different and it doesn't hurt when I inevitably don't get the next job. Humans are surprisingly adaptable. I will start looking into low-skilled labor soon. I think I will be happier there. It really goes to show how much our economy has changed. 20 years ago, a college education more or less guaranteed you an office job. Now, an Ivy League degree means nothing on its own. When I tell people over 40 that they can't believe it.
