I'm such a loser. My GPA at Cornell fell from a 3.3 freshman year engineering to a horrendous low and I was forced to take a leave of absence my senior year. Because I started off ok, no one really cared to look at my grades until the end. I was so stupid that I really thought I could turn my life around that I never looked to get help. I was just too scared to go and meet with therapists and counselors. I still am. I must be one of the few engineers whose grades actually fell progressively through the years. I look around me at all of my friends and even kids from high school that graduated already and they're all doing so well. Many will be making high salaries in exciting career fields or going to prestigious graduate school programs--even the ones who were far below me academically. I fucking hate what I've done to myself. I want to get help, but from where? My overbearing and high strung parents who will probably disown me once they find out I haven't been going to school? My overachieving little brother who has a tougher major than me and is doing very well? The worst thing is...being a member in a minority Asian ethnicity makes this whole situation 10 times worse. The whole ~1,000,000 strong community is tight-knit and news travels fast. When they find out I'm not going to school and that I'm a basket case, they'll all look at me disapprovingly and pat their prestigious-college attending, highly successful children on the backs and thank God that they didn't fuck up like me.
