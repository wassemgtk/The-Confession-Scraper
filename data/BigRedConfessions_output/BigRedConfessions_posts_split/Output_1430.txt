Even anonymously, I'm too scared to confess my true problems to this page because "normal people" tend to give shitty advice. Everyone is so scared of comments that break their fragile little egos and shatter their glassy perceptions of the world that they can't handle anything out of the norm, and that makes leading a truly countercultural life incredibly difficult. There are no points of convergence, besides antagonism and confusion, between the uniform ideology you people spout and what I need help with.
