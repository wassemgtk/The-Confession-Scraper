I am terrified of interviewing. For technical interviews, either you know the stuff or you don't. But for behavioral interviews, the answers are so open ended. I know from the bottom of my hard that I am a great, honest, worker who can resolve issues, but I have trouble of thinking of specific examples in my life. I also feel extremely pressured to get a good internship this summer. My other friends from high school still aren't taking their internship search that seriously. I am glad I am ahead of the game, but sometimes I think the environment at Cornell makes me unnecessarily stressed about it. I just hope my first behavioral interview goes well so I'll be more relaxed and confident in the future, and I also hope I get a decent internship..
