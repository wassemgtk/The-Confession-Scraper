Why are girls always being called out on sleeping with guys, being shallow, or not good enough? I have yet to meet many guys with the same qualities. Yet no one questions this. Maybe girls wouldn't feel insecure or be advised to play games when what seems like a majority of guys aren't interested in a relationship. Guys and girls alike, if you're interested in someone DO SOMETHING about it. Don't wait 3 days, or wait 3 hours to text back. Take control of your life and be genuine. In saddens me when I see people tearing and ripping "types" of people on here.. maybe the people you're meeting are the ones you are attracting.. maybe not.. but at least try and look for the good in people - maybe you'll surprise yourself.
