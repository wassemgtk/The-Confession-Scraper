I've been neglecting my body for such a long time due to all of my work, that I've had a rash for several months and a now tooth cavity that is causing throbbing pain, and it hurts so bad, I can't even focus on anything. Not to mention the chronic headaches. Wish medical treatment didn't have to cost so much - can't afford to have any of these things treated either.
