The thing is, I see myself getting attached to you already. I know this is casual and I keep telling myself that it'll be nothing more than what it is now. I've been so hurt before that I feel numb on the interior. Yet I can't help but show my infectious need to love. I know I deserve this more than ever now but just the idea of attachment pushes me back. I don't know if I'd rather enjoy momentary bliss and conceal my powerless emotions towards you or jump.

"Temporary." I have never heard such a striking word that made me feel both terrified and relieved at the same time. A voice in my head repeats this word over and over until I start questioning if any sort of connection between two beings could last forever. I just beg for moments where I feel completely at ease and when I'm lying next to you or when you push me closer towards you and touch my lips, I feel just that. I can't walk away when it's real but there's nothing that compels me to speak of this because we're just friends and nothing more, right?
