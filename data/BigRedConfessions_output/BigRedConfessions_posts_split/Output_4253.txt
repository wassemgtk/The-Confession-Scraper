I think I am in trouble. At the moment, I am in a long distance relationship with a person who've I dedicated my body and soul to for about 7 months. We had some rough edges because of the distance. At the same time, I think I may be falling for another person while my partner is gone. My feelings for this person is becoming stronger and I can't avoid the person meanwhile I'm starting to think that my feelings for my partner are rapidly diminishing. I don't want to break up nor do I want to cheat. What do I do, people who've been through this?
