It bothers me when people blame Cornell for all their issues. It feels almost like if you're in college, you can blame everything on the administration being bad, or the classes being badly taught, or the environment being weird. Just because you're paying a large amount of money for it doesn't mean it's going to be perfect. Life will be hard, there will be challenges, and yes, you will doubt yourself. Of course there will be a class now and then that doesn't suit the way YOU like to learn. That's only part of the experience. We are here to learn how to survive in the real world. And in the real world, things will not always go your way - however much you want them to. You just have to deal with it.
