I am a second semester freshman and still no friends. I am absolutely miserable. This has by far been the worst year of my life. I don't know what's wrong with me. I have been trying really hard and I'm a perfectly normal guy. Anyway I am strongly considering transferring but man it is disappointing to give up an ivy league degree because of my social life.
