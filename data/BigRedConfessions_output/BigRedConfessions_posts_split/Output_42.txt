1. I don't know if I like this person or if I just care a lot about them as a person (do you know what I'm tryin to say?) I am normally a very caring person so it's hard for me to tell.  2.  If I do like this person, I know that I shouldn't because this person would not be accepted by my family, mostly because of cultural differences.  I'm fairly certain this person is attracted to me.  HELP.
