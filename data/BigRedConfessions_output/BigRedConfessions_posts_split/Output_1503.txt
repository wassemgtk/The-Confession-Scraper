I think I'm going to fucking loose it! I have 2 prelims tomorrow and I am stressing out because I cannot study. I hope a car seriously runs me over at this fucking school. I do not know what the fuck is up with these professors giving two prelims in a day. I won't even have time to eat my lunch at Banfi's. WTF My life is ruined. I'm just going to fucking call my parents who are both alumni to fix this issue so I can have more time to eat and study. I went to Cornell for a reason because the benefits of having parents as alumni gets me anything, sort of like the race card, except this is the Cornell Alumni Benefits Card, since my parents recently endowed several professors throughout the university.
