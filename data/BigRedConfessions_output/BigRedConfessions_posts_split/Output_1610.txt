Confession 6423 really bugs me.  Several times when I've eaten in college town, the service was exceptionally poor and very rude.  I tip very little in these cases because I'm not going to tip you a lot to be rude to me.

On two separate occasions when I've done this (at two different restaurants) the waiter or waitress charged me for a lot more than I wrote on the receipt (my writing isn't messy), which is clearly unacceptable.  Both times I had kept the receipt and ultimately got all of money back as an apology from management, but the fact that this has happened more than once is disturbing and unacceptable.  I'm sure this happens a lot and people don't notice, but it's fraud and it's illegal.
