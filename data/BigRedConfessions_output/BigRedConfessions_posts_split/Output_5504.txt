I wish a crazy dictator would come along who would commit genocide and the gene he would go after would be the gene for attractiveness, meaning targeting attractive people. It would be a terrible tragedy of course, but maybe about 2% fair because life for them is so immeasurably better, it's ridiculous. It's a million times better to be attractive than to be rich. People treat you better, you're only single if you choose to be and you can get whoever you want, you have a higher self esteem, you make friends easier, you probably get a job easier and get promoted easier. Life is so much better as an attractive person and it's the one thing we have no control over. Look at this campus - if you see a truly beautiful girl she's almost always in a top sorority or is in some other way enjoying a high social status and she's often kind of cold and borderline rude - I would be too if all my life I've had to make no effort to make friends or date whoever I wanted and everyone's treated me like a goddess. It's really not her fault... It's just the way the world works. Greatest injustice no one can do anything about.
