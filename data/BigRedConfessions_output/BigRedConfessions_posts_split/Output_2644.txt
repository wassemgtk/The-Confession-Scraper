I love how our sole worlds are strictly a first person account and I sense this urge to gravitate towards you in a romantic way but I hate how I will never perceive the way you do. I just want to jump into your mind to perceive myself the way you do. Your attitude, smile, moan, eyes, gait, voice, lips, words.. ugh I just want more of it.

It's too early to speak up and am in no position to prevent you from searching for and seeking others but dude I've been falling for you since our eyes met.
