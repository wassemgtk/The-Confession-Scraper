I started to fall in love with my best friend here. Over the past few months, every guy she talked about and every complaint about her relationships have been eating away at me. I knew she had a lot of stuff on her plate, but I had to tell her anyway. I told her I loved her and what I think she deserves in a relationship. I now know that in the end, we will only remain friends, but I hope she took what I said to heart. Any guy on this planet would be lucky to be with her.  I have never been in a relationship or been with a girl, but I know what love is about. Its about respect and I respect whatever she wants, even though it is not me.
