"I wash something like once or twice a week here. I do this because the bathrooms are so ridiculously filthy. There's hair everywhere. Girls put their hair on the walls so it doesn't clog the drain. They are only cleaned once or twice a week, so there's hair and puff and dirt everywhere.
It's awful, and the curtains only cover part of the entrance.

I can't believe I am charged $4500/semester for this crap."
