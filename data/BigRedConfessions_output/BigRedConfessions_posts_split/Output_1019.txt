I don't know why I'm here anymore. What's the point? I used to be the "smart" one, a good student, a social person. Here, I have friends, but more often then not I can't see them because I'm studying. Last round of prelims I didn't study that much, and I got the average. This time around I studied my ass off just to end up ten points below the average for both math and science. I'd be perfectly happy with B-s on my transcript, I just really don't want to get Cs. I've worked too hard to settle for Cs. Every time I think about my GPA I end up locking myself in the bathroom and crying for an hour, only to get up because I'm wasting time I should spend studying. My professors have made it clear that they can't help me get a better grade, that all I can do is "work harder" and my TAs have actually made fun of me because of my bad grades.  And the sad part is, if I drop out of engineering I'll feel like even more of a failure. If I didn't have the support of my long-distance relationship to keep me going, I probably would have killed myself by now. I just keep wondering, what's the point of doing this?
