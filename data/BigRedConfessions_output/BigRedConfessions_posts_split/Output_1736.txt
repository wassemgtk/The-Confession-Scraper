I am afraid to drive, but I am also scared that if I tell anyone or anyone finds out they will think I am a loser. :/ I always avoid driving anywhere with friends and always ask them to provide a ride because I am embarrassed to tell them I have a license and can't drive. I don't know what to do I ran into a curb and destroyed my tire once and never went to drive again since I got my license in 12th grade. I suck at life and I am just a worthless loser. I never will find a significant other either because they will laugh at me that I cannot drive or that I suck at driving. For instance, I can drive on slow roads but I am afraid of the thruway or turnpike because there are so many trucks and you have to drive fast. If the speed limit is 45 or 65 everyone is flying at 20 miles over and they would honk at me for driving slow. I am a living nightmare.
