I've just spent this charter weekend studying for a final on Tuesday. My professor is holding class on Monday morning so I don't have extra time like I assumed I would have. I don't mind though. There is absolutely nothing to celebrate about this place. I fucking hate it here. After North Korea, Cornell is the worst place on the planet. I can't wait until I get that degree and I can leave this place forever. I wish that I make so much money that when Cornell asks me for a donation I can give them a giant fuck you. I would bring a giant pile of cash and burn on the Engineering quad or Arts quad (doesn't really matter to me). But the point is that would be the ultimate fuck you. Like I have an absurd amount of money to donate but would rather burn this money than give it to you Cornell. If I ever become famous, I would always rip on Cornell. Just destroy its reputation. This is all of course a fantasy and would never happen but I wish it would. This only describes a fraction of my hatred of this place. I don't think I've hated anything this much before. I think I'm certifiably insane.
