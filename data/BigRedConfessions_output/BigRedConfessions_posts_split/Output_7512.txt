I fucking hate this school. It has thinned my hair, killed my immune system, dried out my skin, given me anxiety, insomnia and depression, and completely drained the little self-esteem I had coming here. But damn am I going to make so much money coming out of here. Is it worth it? I'm not sure anymore.
