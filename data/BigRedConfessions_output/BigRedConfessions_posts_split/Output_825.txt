I'm happy to be home with my family, and to have a few weeks to sleep in and read books I've wanted to get to and hang out with old friends and hit the gym and binge watch movies and all of that stuff I've been looking forward to for weeks.

But I'm also looking forward to coming back next month. I'm looking forward to going through rush week as a guy already in a frat for the first time. I'm looking forward to seeing all my friends again and creating more memories. I'm looking forward to a couple of the interesting classes I'm taking next semester. And I'm looking forward to picking things up where I left off with this girl I've been seeing that I really, really like.

There's always a lot of negativity on this page, and I've contributed to it in the past. And certainly I've got my worries: my finances, grades, the summer internship search, etc. But right now, looking at things as a whole, I think my life is in a pretty good place, and I feel great about it.
