What happened?  I was a serious flirt in elementary school.  Me and Tom were inseperable.  I cried when Matt moved away. Jacob and I held hands in the story circle.  I'm using this confession as some serious reflection.  I'm a senior in college now, and I've never had a boyfriend.  I'm definitely attracted to guys, and have been since a young age, but something happened along the way, I think, that has made it hard for me to move forward in relationships with guys.  Maybe it's just that Mr. Right hasn't come along.  I've had the potential to have boyfriends - several guys have made their feelings for me quite clear, and I just haven't reciprocated the feels back at them.  The guys I do like either end up having girlfriends or are intimidating to me for some reason (I can't explain it; I choke up).  In any case, I keep looking for that "feeling," you know, of being smitten or whatever.  Really, really liking a guy.  Maybe that doesn't come right in the beginning though.  Are you supposed to date someone and then get that feeling?  Please let me know if you can.  Maybe my standards are too high, or my perceptions of how this works are off somewhere.  
I do know that later in elementary school and in middle school having a boyfriend was seriously shunned by my dad.  I'm sure he had the best of intentions, but I really looked up to him and wanted to impress him.  It felt good saying "NO" when he asked if I had any boyfriends.  It felt good pretending boys had cooties and that they were gross to interact with on the playground.  I don't know if that's weird.  I don't know if that's just me blaming someone.  
I do know I long for closeness with someone.  I want someone to hold hands with, and to go on dates with, and to laugh with, and cuddle with, and to hug all the time.  I long for that feeling of excitement and happiness of just thinking about someone for whom you care about on that level - I have had that before for one person, but it obviously didn't work out.  He didn't love me back or we weren't right for each other or something.  I don't know how to go about finding that right someone.  I don't go to parties and hook up with people.  Dating apps are just strange and cause me to lose faith in humanity.  All-in-all, I'm a pretty lost gal.  I'm good at learning, but I feel like this is something that can't be taught.  Or maybe it is and I'm just looking in the wrong places.  Maybe I'm just being impatient.
