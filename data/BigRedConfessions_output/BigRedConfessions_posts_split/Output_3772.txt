"The CuCare Challenge""

Find at least one person who is having a rough day, write them an encouraging note, smile and wave, email them a funny video or reddit, treat them to a cookie or hot cocoa (or if you're generous, both!), or anything you can think of to express your compassion and that you care. it can make a big difference in that person's day, it sure did for me. #100happydays #cornell #cornellmindsmatter #CuCare â€” feeling inspired.
