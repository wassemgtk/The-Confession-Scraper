This confession terrifies me. This confession terrifies me because I'm afraid that a boy who I have feelings for, and who (may?) have claimed to have feelings for me, will think that I'm playing games with him and give up on us as well. But for me at least that's not the case. Maybe this person isn't intentionally playing games, maybe they are confused themselves, maybe you think you've made your feelings absolutely clear but in all actuality you have not. Who knows? I hate to see people give up on love, so, if this is "love" like you claim it is, maybe you should have one final open and honest heart-to-heart talk with them. Maybe loves worth it. Maybe they're worth it. Or, of course, maybe not.
