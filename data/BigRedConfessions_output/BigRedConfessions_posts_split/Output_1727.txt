I don't know if you know this but I have the biggest crush on you. Probably since sophomore year since you asked me to watch your stuff. We are seniors now and I just can't help think about if I had gone for it and told you. I always try to look away when you are walking by because I feel like if I stare I'll give myself away or look creepy. I'm not going to say anything because I never do. And I suspect that you wouldn't say yes because you are not that type of girl. My friends always tell me I should go for it and talk to you but it's not that easy. So, I guess what I'm trying to say is just stay awesome.
