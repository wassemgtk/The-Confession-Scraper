"Young and dumb was where it was at for me for awhile but now that I'm older so many of you girls here are just immature and its not going to work any longer. I really need to date someone over 24 but thats the problem, 24 and over is just not as fresh anymore. 

Maybe I should just focus on me and try to mature myself first "
