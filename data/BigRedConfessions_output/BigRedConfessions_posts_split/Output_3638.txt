I think I'm a chronic masturbator. It's gotten to the point where I feel weird if I go to bed without having masturbated at least once during the day. What makes it worse is it's really hard for things other than my right hand to get me off anymore, I mean, someone I randomly meet at a party just isn't gonna have the skills to keep up with me. I suppose I need a long term girlfriend, but who is gonna date someone they can't get to orgasm?
