One day early last semester, I stared at myself in the mirror for a long time. I was a bit depressed that I never had a best friend, that I never had a girlfriend, that I was not smart. Three years into college and still no one I would want to keep in touch with after college. I mean if you live with someone and you don't say hi when you see each other on campus. What are you? Acquaintances. I remember saying to myself "Fuck this." I was going to pull myself out of this. Fast forward 8 months and I couldn't be happier with my progress. I willed myself to get up early and work out. I disciplined myself. I wasn't fat before but I certainly didn't have a six-pack. I forced myself to study like crazy. If I under-performed on an exam, I studied like crazy and got myself the highest grade on the next one. I wasn't going to let some exam bring me down. Over the summer, at my internship, I became pretty good at this adult thing. I learned how to cook and manage my money. I also started teaching myself another language. When I got back on campus, some people said to me "There's something different about you." I just responded with the smile "I'm still the same." Little did they know that my life did a 180. Another big thing I did was accept my introverted nature. I started going out and enjoying nature more. I didn't feel bad for not having close friends. I was complete without others. Social media is a good thing and a bad thing. It sometimes makes you feel bad about not having friends. I got off of most social media sites except facebook because I still need that for group projects. I feel good. Really good. As Thanksgiving approaches, I'm thankful for all the things that happened that led to this. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't easy. There were some bad days early on but I got through with brute willpower and discipline like a champ. You might be thinking that I'm being arrogant and bragging. But, I really don't know anyone well enough to talk to them about this. So anonymously feeling good about myself is the next best thing. Also, to the people struggling, I'm not going to pretend I know your situation because frankly I don't. I wasn't in that bad of a place as some other people. I'm also not going to tell you that things get better. You can't wait for when they get better, if they do. You have to make it better. I was tired of being on the losing side of life. The anger combined with a desire to prove to myself that I can be better drove me. The reality is that you're the only one on your team and only you have the power to put your team in the winning column. My 21st birthday is in a few weeks and when I think about where I am and who I am, I can't help but feel proud of my journey. I still have a long way to go.
