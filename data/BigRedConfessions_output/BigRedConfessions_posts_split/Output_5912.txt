"I'm so ridiculous. If it weren't for that one detail I'd probably be holding you and your struggles in my arms right now and trying to make it all better. Maybe ignorance is bliss. 
I miss you so, so much and even if we both made mistakes it doesn't mean we can't get better, or be better people in general. 

The one part that kills me is that I've heard the opinions of so many people, contrary to yours, but what's important is that I always kept you within me, right?

Even if I really, really fucked up.... I've bawled my eyes out for you, it feels like I've gone through hell and back, and at the end of it all I still care about you.

You're still in my heart and in my soul and I know you had some logic and reason behind some of your actions. 

We are human, we are not perfect-but that should not serve as an obstacle for me to help glue back the pieces of your soul together-that was my goal from the beginning and it should continue to be. "
