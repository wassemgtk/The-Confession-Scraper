My significant other and I are grateful for our job offers in our respective fields that are waiting for us after graduation. But what sucks is that they are on opposite ends of the country. It's impossible finding jobs for both of us in the same city. I'm scared that we will try the long distance thing and we'll have to end up splitting up. It isn't fair.
