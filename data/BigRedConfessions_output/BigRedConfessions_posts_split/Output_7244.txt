I'm probably going to be writing a series of confessions in case she misses this one. I know she'll come across these and have no idea who they're about, because no one ever does. I'll reveal it to her when the time is right (if that time ever comes). Anyway, this girl and I are friends. We hang out on occasion, and there's most likely nothing special about our relationship to her. I sense from her that she has no interest, though we have hooked up multiple times, drunk. But there's something about this girl. There's something I see in her that I've never seen in any other girl before. Even with everything that's happened in her life, she might be the most cheerful girl you'll ever meet. She radiates good vibes like no one else, and just being in her presence makes me smile. Like actually smile, and I rarely smile. To make matters worse (but not really at all), she's drop dead gorgeous. It's the softness of her lips, the perfection that is her hair, the flawlessness of her face, and a smile that lights up the room to top that all off. I could go on and on, but I don't want to be creepy, if this isn't already.  She probably has an inkling about how I feel, but she definitely doesn't know to what extent. 

I wish I could be around her more often. She actually lives really close, but she always seems so distant. I have made it clear to her that I'm interested (mind you, I was drunk); she seems indifferent to my feelings, even though that may just be me expecting the worst. Maybe my feelings are reciprocated. Maybe not. 

But there is one thing I do know. I want to save this girl.
