I really like this a guy, but he has a lot of female friends. He messages me often, but I don't know whether he does it because he is interested in me or because he texts all of his friends. I know that interacting with him will make me fall for him even more, so sometimes I make excuses when he asks me to hang out with him. I don't think he only sees me as a useful friend, and I simply can't be 'just friends' with this guy. What should I do?
