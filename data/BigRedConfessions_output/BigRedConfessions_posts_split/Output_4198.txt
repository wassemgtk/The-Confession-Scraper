I can't handle this feeling that keeps growing inside me. I just want to kill myself already, but I recently joined a group on campus that I look forward to going to each week and that always pulls me back from suicidal thoughts. Still, it makes me want to be with this group all the time I'm awake, and any time I'm not with it I spend hating myself and my own existence.
