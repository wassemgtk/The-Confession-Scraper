Whenever I read posts in Cornell Confessions, I feel depressed because more than half of the posts are about people hating Cornell. I think it's always about transferring out, school pressure, depression, or anger about school administration. I mean, some of them are understandable to a certain degree, but it always makes me kinda guilty because I am currently really happy here and I never wanted to drop out even in my hard days. Is the name value of this school the only reason why people choose to remain and graduate Cornell?
