If she had told you 9 months ago that she cheated three times, my guess is that you would have (rightfully) broken up with her. Shouldn't lying about it for almost a year make it worse, not better?

Seriously, if it was once and she admitted to it immediately, then maybe you could work on rebuilding things (though I wouldn't). In this case, it was multiple cases and compounded by even more untrustworthiness.

It would take years just to get back to the same level of trust as you would have with someone new after a month. Move on.
