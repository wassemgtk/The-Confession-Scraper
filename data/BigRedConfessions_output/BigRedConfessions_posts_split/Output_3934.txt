I used to watch porn. I started when I was like 12 years old. But I haven't watched it in about 10 years. One day, when I was 14, my mom walks into the bedroom and sees me doing it. She was astonished and just started throwing things at me and yelling at me to stop. I ignored her and kept going. So she told my dad about it. He put up the child-safety locks on the search engines. But I found ways to bypass that. About a week passed and one day my mom comes into my room and sees me doing it again. This time she just calmly comes to my table and says: "Room for one more?" and she just sits down and watches me...After a few seconds of awkward silence, I just turned off the computer, go outside, and go for a long walk. I never again masturbated.
