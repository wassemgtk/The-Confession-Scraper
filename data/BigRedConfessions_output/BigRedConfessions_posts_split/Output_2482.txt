I’ve been bullied for years about my body, in particular my calves. I danced ballet for 11 years, and almost decided to go on for a 12th, which would let me dance in the esteemed pointe shoes, the iconic mark of a true ballerina. I had never noticed what my body looked like until one day a girl in one of my classes smirked at me and said, “Your legs are JACKED!” The fact that she pretended to be my friend for that year and then proceeded to show her true feelings toward me after only exacerbated my insecurity. I remember going to the bathroom during calculus one afternoon and spending a few minutes in the stall just staring at my massive calves, standing in their black stockings and black high-heeled boots, and clutching my face in embarrassment. The smirks and condescending remarks and treatment I continued to receive for the rest of my high school career served only to sink my self-esteem to new lows. Even coming to Cornell, I’ve had friends tell me that I’m fat, that I eat a lot, that I wouldn’t fit into someone’s pants because their bottom half is thinner than mine, that I look a certain weight, that I’m going to eat *gasp* “Again?”, that I just need to eat so much because I’m taller (without realizing the unhealthy implications their comments have, which are exacerbated because they are expressed jokingly, as if my perception of my weight is trivial).

After spending the past two hours finding and reading blog posts about Asian-Americans detailing their personal experiences with being called “fat” and about how the dismissal of the possibility of Asians being fat in American media only makes size 2+ Asians feel more invisible, I cried for about half an hour. I cried because strong Asian-American female voices were reassuring me that I am not abnormal, reassuring me that my inability to lose weight (healthily or unhealthily) is not a result of my laziness, reassuring me that I am not worthless, reassuring me that I’m more than my body. 

I cried because I was a perpetrator of my own suffering. I fixate on physical appearance, and I do what is verbally considered taboo but is tacitly accepted as inevitable: I judge. Everywhere I walk, I compare every other person’s calves with mine, not missing a single person in my line of sight. Every time I see people at a party or wearing tight-fitting or revealing clothing, I compare every other person’s waist and chest and arms and feet and backside with my own. “She has no waist, but she has such beautiful legs! Her thighs are huge, but her feet are tiny! Her body is so fat, but her face is so thin!” 

And perhaps the worst, “What a pity, she has a monolid.” The guilt was unrelenting when I came to the horrifying and unforgivable realization that I, too, would grab my newborn baby and desperately want to know whether she had double eyelids. I could not stop crying. For so long, after the childhood I had experienced, I had vowed that I would love my children no matter what they looked like. I had believed that I wouldn’t destroy my children’s self-esteem and ingrain in them that they are fat or unattractive. Crying, I asked myself, “What is wrong with you? Does your baby’s appearance take priority over their well-being? Is it not enough for your child to grow up to be healthy, happy, and kind?” Health, happiness, and kindness: the physical body is a vessel that allows you to be these things, so why are you so destructively fixated on torturing and hating your vessel to match the vessels of others? Thinking about my children hating the precious people they are cripples me with guilt. We are all children to people who would be crippled with guilt and be ridden with misery if they knew how much we hated ourselves, and for such an unjustifiable reason. All I want for my children is to see them be healthy and happy and kind. They don’t need to be anything else.

I wanted to message someone I consider(ed) a close friend of mine until almost two months ago. I would have messaged you or talked to you about this, because I miss talking to you about things, and because this is just something I’d be comfortable talking to you about. But we’re not close anymore, it seems, and this will be the second time in my life, and in the past year that I’ve had to come to terms with the fact that, no matter how much I miss someone, they may never come back. 

So, instead, I’m posting this on Cornell Confessions because I want you all to hear this. I’m pretty sure I’ve added enough details in this post so that my friends know who I am.
