I don't love you anymore, but I still have feelings for you. At the same time, I know I need to move on. I have someone who is interested in me and I'm interested in him as well. But I know deep inside, I still want you, not him. That's why I keep contacting you. I know this is hurtful to all of us, but it's not easy to keep you out of my mind.
