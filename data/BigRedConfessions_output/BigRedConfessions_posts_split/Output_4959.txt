I'm going into my senior year at Cornell and I just can't get too hyped about it yet...these past couple years have been...well, I'VE been a little disconnected since I was in a long distance relationship that didn't work out. I'm glad to be done with that (It was for the best) but now I'm worried I won't have the time/social circle to do all the fun things that Cornell has to offer. Ironically, I'm in a sorority that I USED to love but now I've come to realize that a good amount of the sisters are real bitches. Nonetheless, I hope I can find those few good sisters/friends outside of my sorority that I can really bond with and have a great last year at Cornell. I want to make it worthwhile...but if I can't achieve that, I just hope its bearable.
