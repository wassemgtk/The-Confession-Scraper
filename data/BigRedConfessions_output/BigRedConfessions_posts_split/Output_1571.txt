I haven't been stressing out lately ever since I've been at cornell. I'm easy with myself. I'm just lazy to do things because no one is pushing me and neither am I pushing myself. But I have a problem. When I'm studying, all I do is think about cute boys and how it will be like when I get married. Then I can't concentrate and I day dream about having a boyfriend. Why am I doing this? Im only 18 haha.
