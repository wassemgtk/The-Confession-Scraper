I was so excited for graduation. The place I interned at last year had promised me a good job. The day after I graduated, they emailed me to tell me they would no longer hire me. Since then I've lost count of how many applications I've sent. I was living with my parents in an extremely rural place, and had no friends or contact with anyone. Tonight, they kicked me out of the house. I have nowhere to go, no food, shelter, or warm clothing. I don't know where I'm going to spend the night, or if I'm going to survive long.
