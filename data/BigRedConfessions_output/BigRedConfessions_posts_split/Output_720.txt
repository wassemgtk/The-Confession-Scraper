I'm really disappointed by the double standards that widespread reaction (or is it apathy?) towards the Oregon militia reveals in our country and how we perceive violence. There's a silver lining in that it has stimulated discussion over federal power and mandatory minimums, but truly I believe that the double standard that are more more blatantly obvious are just tragic.
