"You are not a kind person. Every day, you're complaining about someone and how they were too vapid or too stupid or too useless. You probably talk shit behind my back, too, since I generally disagree with berating everyone and everything.
The thing is, I'm over being mad at you. I'm just quietly counting down the days until I'm back on a flight to California, and you're off to whatever expensive vacation your parents are paying for. And I pity you. Because, the way I see it, there are two possibilities as to why you are such a negative person. The first is that you are incapable of seeing the good in anything and are so focused on what you perceive to be wrong with the world that you can't see anything half decent about it. That's a pretty shitty way to be, but one day you might get over that. The second thing is worse, in my opinion. It's that you derive happiness from all the vitriol you spew at everyone. Happiness at the expense of hating everyone else in the world? Now that's screwed up.
So, glad I'll be on West with real friends and far away from you."
