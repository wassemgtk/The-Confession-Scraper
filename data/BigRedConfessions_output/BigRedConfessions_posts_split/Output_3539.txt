I am in my early 20's and I've never had a boyfriend or even kissed a guy for that matter.  I really look forward to having a boyfriend and even a family one day but it's not like I say that when I talk to guys because I know that would turn them away.  I feel like something's wrong with me.  I think part of the problem is that my parents put a lot of pressure on me to get a boyfriend a few years ago.  It made me extremely nervous and now every guy I talk to I think about them as a potential boyfriend and I make myself nervous.  Sometimes I choke up and other times I'm fine but that nagging thought is always there and I feel weird about it.  I feel like I have a hard time being myself.  I also feel like guys aren't really interested in me. Maybe I'm just oblivious or maybe something's wrong with me. I don't really know what I'm doing wrong.
