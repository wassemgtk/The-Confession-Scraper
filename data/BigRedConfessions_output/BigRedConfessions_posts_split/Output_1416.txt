I have HPV. It makes me so mad because I have a super boring sex life and can literally count the number of partners I have had on one hand. And this isn't the hidden killer, cancer causing variety that shows up on random Pap smears; it's the kind that causes the horrible, disgusting, ugly warts :-( i got myself treated and with some meds and a treatment plan, the warts have vanished now, which is good, but I am terrified that they will come back. To make matters worse, I just started seeing someone and I really like him. And because I like him and I want this to be more than a meaningless romp, I feel like I am obliged to tell him the truth before anything happens between us. But, I am sure that this information will drive him away from me faster than rats fleeing a sinking ship. I don't know what to do, and this scares me because I actually care about him and I want him to like me. :-( Actually, I do know what to do, so I guess I am just going to spend the next couple of weeks, eating junk food in order to build up the cushy layers that will cushion the inevitable blow :-(
