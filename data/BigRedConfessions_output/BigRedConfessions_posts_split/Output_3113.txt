I thought you were in love with me too and that you would go every night where we met as I did up until now. Where are you? Please show up, please surprise me. I would be happy even if you told me you are gay and by no means you can be attracted to me. But please show up again before you graduate! probably if you didn't come back it's because you don't care. I should give up hoping, but it's so hard!
