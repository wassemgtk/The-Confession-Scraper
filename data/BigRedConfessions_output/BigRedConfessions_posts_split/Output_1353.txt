Why is it that whenever posts something (typically conservative), that they're always called out as a troll? Is it really that hard to believe that someone has a different opinion than you? Maybe they're wrong, maybe they're actually bat-shit insane, but try being open-minded enough to consider that someone with an alternate viewpoint isn't doing it just to annoy you. That's unbelievably narcissistic.
