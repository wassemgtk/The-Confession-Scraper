The only reason I'm alive so far is because my parents are alive. But once their gone, I can finally end my life. I mean I really don't care about my friends, sister, or my step-dad enough to stick around. I'm a shitty person. I know that. But I stopped caring about what people think about me a long time ago. Once they are gone, I'll truly have nothing to lose.
