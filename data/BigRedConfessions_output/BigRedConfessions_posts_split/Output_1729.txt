I understand where you are coming from. I lost a very good friend to suicide in high school and her death was traumatizing for a very long time. I was afraid to love another person, girl or boy, in a romantic way or not because I was hypersensitized to death and how easily it can come at any moment to anyone. I wore a mask for a long time and chose quantity oover quality to avoid developing too deep of a connection with people. It is really hard to come to terms with this but you have to learn to live in the moment and be grateful for every interaction you have/had with others. 

Love is not qualified by the amount of time you get to spend with someone, whether it is returned, or whether they are still in your life to continue it with you. It just is a thing that happens and will continue to happen if you push for it and enjoy the feeling of bonding it brings. Do not get hard bent on forever when you have the beauty of moment that you are in right now. 

I recommend looking into Neil Pasricha, he has both a ted talk and a really cool book about this. And if you ever need a song to remind you of the small good things in a moment, try Farrah Fawcet hair by capital cities.
It's a long process with loud growing pains but I promise you, with the right mindset you'll come to acceptance.
