To the pieces of shit who OVERDREW FUNDS on my Net Print account tonight in Mann between 6pm and 10pm (especially the one who printed 45 PAGES worth of material):

I was already having a horrible day and thinking about how much I think people at this school can suck. I was extremely preoccupied and forgot to sign out before rushing to a night class. Thanks for only confirming what I know. Plus, I'd like my ~$20 back.

Love,
So ready to leave '15
