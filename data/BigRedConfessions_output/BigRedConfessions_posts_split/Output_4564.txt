"I'm tired of people disrespecting me for my major. When you disrespect what I study, it's the equivalent of you blatantly tell me that what I like and want is stupid. And it makes it hard for me to see myself ever being respected by anyone for anything. 

I'm also tired of people in my major disrespecting me for having interests outside what I study. Nobody is so boring that they only are interested in one thing. 

Okay, rant over. I'm just tired of it. This is senior year for crying out loud. If I didn't change before, there's no way in hell I'd be changing now. So stop.
