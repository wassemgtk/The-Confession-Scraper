"It's winter break, but I feel so depressed. My home is warmer than Ithaca but it's still humid and cold. I didn't do well my first semester at Cornell. My family is always fighting. I belong to a different culture than my family. Isolation. Depression. I don't feel love. I don't feel that I am home. 

I should have stayed at Cornell for the winter break. "
