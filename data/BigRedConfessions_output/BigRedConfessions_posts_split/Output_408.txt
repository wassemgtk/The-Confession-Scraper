I constantly feel overshadowed by my older brother. No matter what I do, he is always lucky with life and girls, and I just feel clumsy around him. Even my friend has a huge crush on him, which stings since I have a bit of a crush on her too. I can't be too jealous though. He has always been very supportive throughout my whole life, almost to an overbearing degree. 

For example, he once told me not to believe in myself, but in the him that believes in me, while pointing at the sky. I guess I should take his advice and try to do the impossible. Fight the powah!
