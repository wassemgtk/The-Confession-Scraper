"I'm sick and tiered of people asking me what I want to do and then saying something along the lines of, ""is that even a thing?"" My career aspirations are constantly downplayed by people who know nothing of my field. Because of this I have lowered and lowered my job expectations and then get super excited when I find a job that fits precisely (and I'm already in one, although its temporary). I'm sick of this roller coaster.
