I signed up for 4 things this weekend. Two of them expect me to be there 24/7. Fuck off, spoiled Cornell kids, that's just unreasonable. I didn't commit for a 24/7 thing, nor is there even a need. Clubs at Cornell are so damn unrealistic- I guess that's what happens when you put rich spoiled dicks in charge of things
