To the person who complained about being called selfish for having a private apocalypse bunker:
Please, PLEASE don't be all like "you had it coming for you" just because someone doesn't have the thousands of dollars lying around to build a massive underground apocalypse-proof bunker with "a drinking water plant, a septic tank, massive generators, fuel storage tanks, along with televisions, telephones, a bathroom and showers, and comfy beds."  Hell, if a nuclear war does start, the only way I'll be able to "get underground" is if I dig myself a hole BECAUSE THAT'S ALL I CAN AFFORD.  Yes, you have every right to spend your money your way.  In fact, you might even be in the same financial situation as me but with different priorities, so yeah you do your thing and that doesn't make you selfish.  But laughing at other people who chose to spend their money differently (ie on tuition/food/rent) and implying that they deserved to die because they weren't prepared makes you an ASSHOLE.  That's on par with laughing at all the civilians who've lost their lives in countless previous wars/epidemics "because they weren't prepared."
