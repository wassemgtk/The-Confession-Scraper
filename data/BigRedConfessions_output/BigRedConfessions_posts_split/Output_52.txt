From my observations, academia, in a nutshell, is where you go to study everything that's wrong with world. This is neither good nor bad, it just is. I mean, it makes sense to study issues or you'd be wasting your time, trying to keep things as they are. In my opinion, there should be more collaborative, solution- based courses where bright minds from different departments can work together, and not just students, professors too. Just saying.
