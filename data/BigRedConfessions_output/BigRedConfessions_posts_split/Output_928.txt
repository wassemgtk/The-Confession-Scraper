Been hearing and reading a lot of news about all the time and money going toward this Anabel's Grocery project. Can someone explain to me what the big deal or importance of this project is, because I'm not seeing it. I understand that food is an issue on campus, but they keep making it sound like it's a food supply issue and our current issue is not supply, its cost. Everyone knows the on-campus grocery stores suck but we have many nearby ones with bus distance- Target, Tops, Wal-Mart, Wegmans, and Aldis, and all students have bus passes. I'm an upperclassmen without a meal plan and I use the bus when needed to get to any local grocery store to get the groceries I need , so accessibility is not difficult or limited to only people with cars. The only value I see in investing in this grocery store on campus is if they're going to be cheaper than those markets or provide financial aid for food. If not, I honestly don't see how this addresses the issue of food security and I see it as a waste of money unless someone can better explain the value of it.
