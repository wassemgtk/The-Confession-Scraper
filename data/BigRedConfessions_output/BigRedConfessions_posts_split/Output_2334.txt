I have been crushing hard on you for a while now, and I have caught you staring at me almost as much as you have caught me doing the same. One thing I noticed was your scars and I really want to just talk to you about that because I have the same scars, yet I don't know how to start that conversation nor do I know how comfortable you are with talking about them...
