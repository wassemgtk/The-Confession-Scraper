People really just piss me off. All I want is to left alone and do my own thing. Damn, I should have went to a smaller school. Oh well, I can't transfer now(3rd year). I actually hate talking in general. I really have nothing to say to anybody. Small talk is the worst. You pretend you care by asking how are classes or some nonsense about the weather, but you don't really care. No one really cares. People are just waiting for their turn to talk. Conservation of words, people (it's a thing). I wonder how I became such an antisocial introvert. But yeah, don't talk to me. You'll probably just ruin my day.
