I'm entering Cornell this fall as a junior transfer and my 22nd birthday is on Monday August 25th, right before classes begin. I'm partly worried because I'll feel old as hell (even though I'm not much older than the average undergrad) and partly worried because I will need to get crunk and there better be some birthday drink specials in Ithaca goddamnit
