I have a lot of friends, but not many who really, really care or want to know about me or spend time with me. I guess you could say I don't have a best friend. When I went home the past summer, none of my friends from high school (I had just finished freshman year) reached out to me to hang out or spend time together. The friends I make and introduce to each other end up becoming better friends to each other than to me. Its like they've forgotten about me. I know they haven't and I don't want to be a whiny bitch about it but I seriously feel like if I killed myself, people would care and remember for a few years but then forget about me. I'm so easily replaceable. I hate to use a cheesy quote but it just feels like a lot of people care, just not enough.
