I am a gay male and all I want is someone who is looking for a relationship. And the only way I feel its possible on this campus to find similar people is through grindr, which is seriously unfortunate. There needs to be a more coherent and accepting community here, I am tired of and disgusted with feeling alone even though I know so many other LGBT people.
