This is totally random, and I don't know if he will ever read this.......but last semester I randomly stumbled into sage chapel and this guy was playing the piano......organ......I want to say organ... by himself in a completely empty sage chapel . When he noticed I was there, he just smiled and kept playing, and I probably sat there by myself listening for half an hour with a huge stupid smile on my face. If you're out there, if for some reason you read this, I just want you to know that that moment crossed my mind, even fourth months after, and I would really love to hear you play again, and of course, finally meet you.
