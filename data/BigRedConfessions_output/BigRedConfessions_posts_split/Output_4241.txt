I'm so conflicted about whether to stay with my long distance girlfriend.  She's so amazing and would do anything for me. I really care about her, but I just don't have the time right now. I can't balance having a life here, doing well in school, and also making time for her. I know that means I should probably break up with her, but eventually, I will have the time, and I'm scared I'll never have anyone as good as her again. Ive tried to talk to her about this and she doesn't understand. I don't know what to do.
