My boyfriend recently moved back with his parents and he is going through a rough time in his life. I feel conflicted about if I should stay with him. On one hand, I care about him like a family and I know that staying with him will help him to recover. On the other hand, I have stopped liking him a while back and now the unhappiness has really manifested. I wonder if I should break up with him or wait until he recovers and then break up. Either way, I feel that I am being really selfish.
