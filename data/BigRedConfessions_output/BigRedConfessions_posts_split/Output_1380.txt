Response to 6595 (Summary: Honestly, Cornell makes people miserable): I think this is better stated as "Cornell makes (a lot of) not extraordinarily extroverted people miserable". Let's list reasons why!

Disclaimer: I think the vast majority of people here are pretty cool, its just circumstance that makes things difficult. I'm not personally bitter I just am trying to encourage people to realize that there is a problem with students being pushed into miserable situations and we as a community should rally to create tangible change. I remember the other week with a bunch of crap about mental health 'awareness'. To me that was just a bunch of kids posting trendy pictures on facebook (sorry about the edge, maybe it helped someone), but what did it do for the many kids who are left feeling isolated and rejected by the Cornell community as a whole? Mental health effects all sorts of people, but I think that particularly isolated individuals are at the greatest risk. I think in order to address this we can both lighten the stress load on everybody while maintaining the same level of academic excellence and we can provide social opportunity that is tangible even to more introverted students.

Assumption: Stress and social isolation are the main causes of misery.

1. Clubs and Greek life (No this isn't a frat hate post). These two groups probably compose the majority of the social scene on campus and they are by nature exclusive. I would imagine the general idea is to increase the amount of connections made by cutting away the amount of people. Kinda the inverse of the "alone in a crowd" idea. But to be in these groups you ought to be relatively outgoing and social to begin with, cite rush, application/interview process, or even for open clubs, the mere act of showing up (I personally hate putting myself out there; I'm just uncomfortable with it and no amount of patronizing will change that). Well crap, that means for introverts it's hard to meet people beyond classes. Unfortunately for big classes we get the whole alone in a crowd effect so that just leaves us with small classes which normally don't come until further on once friend groups have largely been established further locking people in social bubbles (what about active citizen stuff? see 'showing up' reason explained below). Oh forgot a note: Since the most extroverted people use these avenues to socialize it allows them to in a sense isolate themselves among other extroverts (ideally I think a mix of introverts and extroverts probably more indicative of a healthy community). Also clubs allow for a bit of racial stratification, but the effect of this point is debatable.

2. Student culture! Okay, this one is my biggest concerns. The culture of over competitiveness and dick sizing is ridiculous. It makes everybody miserable and doesn't serve the main instigators to any measurable degree.  On the saltiness of freshman year  (Luckily people (for the most part) grow the fuck up): Get over yourself, you're not even close to the best here (unless you're a medalist at an olympiad or do something crazy like take grad QFT freshman year, then free pass sorry; at least you get to big fish?). Just work hard and treat others with respect. Yes, you are graded on a curve, no, screwing over your peers one at a time will not make a statistically significant impact on your GPA. Now this problem is mostly an ego issue with the students but I would argue its slightly exacerbated by the way that Cornell departments normally grade students ( a good alternative might be a professor establishing what a 'A' quality work is as done by numerous other ivies). Now go out and tell your nearest narcissist to chill the fuck out! (Nicely though, no need to be mean) Also people here would stand to be a little more.. polite. The dismissiveness of some students gets on my nerves from time to time, but its New York so I guess I'm just not used to the culture. Oh and before someone talks about how over competitiveness breeds better students, note the over. Competition is good, but somehow other colleges seem to graduate perfectly damn good people without nuclear ego wars. 

3. Weather. Goddammit Ithaca.

4. Housing situation. This is by no means minor. If Cornell administrators think that they can push half (less but I have no idea what the actual figure is. Its a good chunk.) the student population off campus and not lose part of the "vibrant Cornell community" I think they're poorly mistaken. Build more housing please. The last thing we needed was a damn atrium. Also this is an observation but not much of one that has an easy solution: the fact that housing differs vastly by grade further stratifies social interactions making it harder for students to meet people/break out of social isolation.

5. It's a big university. A large university means a lot of freedom for an individual, but a more divided and apathetic community.

6. Passion. Maybe it just seems this way to me but most people here just don't seem to be very passionate about their majors.. It's either just a dick measuring contest or a "I just want my six fig already" type attitude. Where's the love ya'll?

Fixes: A couple thoughts
a. I actually really like the big-little system that some sororities use and I wish departments (especially in the hard sciences/engineering!) would use a similar method to cross that grade gap and provide mentorship to lonely lil nerds. 

b. Making the grading less competitive would make life a lot better too. Also pass-fail for the first semester of freshman year would have made life so much better (MIT and Caltech[trimester but w/e] do this and I've heard its stunningly successful).

The other problems are maybe too big to tackle directly. The butthurt of Cornellians is refreshed every year, clubs and fraternities will always exist (not that they shouldnt), housing is administrations problem and they couldn't care less. We could switch to using exclusively coal based energy in order to speed up global warming I guess.

*Barriers to 'showing up': I'm explaining this from my own mentality so ya maybe not so general. The reason why I'm scared of showing up is two pronged, a. I don't feel like I belong and b. I'm an incredibly proud person. Honestly I don't have much time for clubs because of my class load + research, so if I go to a club its basically for the sole reason of making friends. When you go to a club I feel like it ought to be because you're interested in the activity itself, but for the most part I don't really care and thus I don't feel like I really belong. For the second bit, I hate feeling like I have to use a club as an excuse to bolster my social life. I already dislike the fact that I have to use people as emotional crutches in general (i.e. for staving off loneliness and depression, I'd rather just be friends with people I really care about, but when you don't know very many people you don't have much of a choice).
