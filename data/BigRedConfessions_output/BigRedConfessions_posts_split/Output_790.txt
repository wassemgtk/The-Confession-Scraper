Today, I realized how screwed up gender dynamics in this world are. I've hardly ever talked about the times when I've felt terrified simply crossing a street because of some creep following me, because I've always felt some sort of shame, as if it's my fault that I'm being looked at in this way, like I'm property for sale. Compliments like "you have a beautiful smile" should feel pleasant, but I tense up waiting for the next line or move because I've been conditioned to fear even innocuous comments. I don't want to have to go out every day into a world like this. We're better than that.

Thankfully, I have not experienced any of this on campus, which gives me hope. Through discussion and awareness, I believe that changes will be made, and I trust the Cornell community to lead the progress.
