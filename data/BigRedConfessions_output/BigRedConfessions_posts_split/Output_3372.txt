My dream last night:
I needed to generate certain biological tissue to submit for a class lab experiment. I forgot to do it. So just before the lab, I decide that the best plan is to cut off my left thumb and  pinky to use instead. Which I then proceeded to do. I then aced the lab at the cost of only two fingers. What a deal! 

What have you done to me, Cornell?
