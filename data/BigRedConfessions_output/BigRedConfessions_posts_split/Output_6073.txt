I've loved you for years and years, and I've been with you as a supporting friend for most of the ups and downs of your love life so far. The only times I really ache to tell you the truth about myself are when you're having a hard time with your relationships. I know I would treat you better than these other people do. It pains me so much to see you hurting. Every time I come close to confessing, though, the thing that stops me is that I want you to be happy. What if this girl you're with now is really the one for you? What if I tell you my feelings, and they are not shared? I can live with you not caring for me in that way, but I can't live with our friendship broken. The worst thing that could happen to me is that you wouldn't want to remain friends. So, I hope you know that I'll always be at your side, through all the troubles you'll face ahead.
