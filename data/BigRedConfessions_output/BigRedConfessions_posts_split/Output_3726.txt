"Oh my god Shut Up. Please, just Shut Up. Confronting racism would be so much easier if white people just knew how to shut up. You know how I learned how to shut up?  I had it slapped in my face that I *actually don't have a fucking clue* what I'm talking about when it comes to race because *I have never experienced racism*!!! Funny, right, how that works? And if I don't know what I'm talking, then maybe I should sit back and *listen*. I know, I know, crazy! Because as white people, no body ever told us that our opinions don't matter. It may be *crazy* but you should really try it some time, because fuck, if you listen to people of color talk about racism, you can learn how much anger and sadness they have built up inside of them, Anger and sadness inherited from centuries of brutal treatment of their ancestors. Anger and sadness at the abuse they experience on a daily basis. Anger and sadness because something as simple as walking into a room, or looking in the mirror, or walking. down. the fucking. street. could be a struggle for them. And if you sat back, listened, and sympathized with even an ounce of the anger and sadness they feel, then maybe you wouldn't be so fucking concerned that someone spraypainted a building. You wouldn't be so concerned that ""I experienced hardship too, so why can't we talk about me??"" You wouldn't be so concerned that someone said they hate white people. BECAUSE WHEN THEIR PEOPLE ARE BEING SHOT DOWN IN THE STREET HOW COULD THEY NOT HATE WHITENESS? 
So fuck, let them be angry. Let them talk, and you just listen. Because, at most, it's an inconvenience for you. But when they are dying at the hands of the white supremacy you benefit from and perpetuate, the least you can do is inconvenience yourself. And what you really should be doing is risking all you got to make it stop."
