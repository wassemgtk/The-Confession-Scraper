"To #7686 (the alumnus looking for athletes who have dealt with depression)

You say you can provide as much anonymity as requested, but you expect the student(s) to publicly comment with their identities visible to the entire group of over four thousand people. I know many people who have struggled with mental health (including myself) are not comfortable coming out to the entire school. Maybe you should provide an email or something so they can privately contact you. Good luck, as I know this is a much needed discussion."
