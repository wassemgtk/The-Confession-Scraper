When I look in the mirror, I'm completely confident in my looks. Then I step outside and I feel massively overweight. How is it possible all the girls on this campus are toothpicks? I remember seeing the girl scouts selling cookies, and then seeing students the same size or smaller. I don't know what to make of this, or how to keep my confidence from leaving me once I walk out the door.
