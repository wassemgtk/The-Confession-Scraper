"It took me 8 years to reconnect with who I am - To grow out of the pain that came with false friends and their judgement of me. To this day I still live in deep depression, but I'll wear a smile because while I am young I have already seen what life has to offer. I have been in the darkness of the last seconds of a life almost taken by myself and back, and I have seen firsthand that even in the darkest of days, there is a light hidden somewhere.
I am beautiful, I am strong, and I am everything that I want in myself. No one out there can tell me otherwise. And damn it, I will prove everyone wrong in everything I do. The last thing you'll have done wrong is to have not believed in me."
