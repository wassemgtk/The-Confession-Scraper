I really do not want to be alive. I don't want to be dead. But I also don't want to be alive. I want to have never existed. Nobody wants me and nobody cares that I exist. I've been rejected by everyone. In romantic, friendship, or professional contexts, people's reaction to me has essnentially been - ""ew"". Women think ""weirdo, creep"" and try to stay as far away as possible. Every new group of people I've met have all become friends and immediately ostracized me. If I try to forcefully insert my presence into a social situation, no one talks to me, they just continue talking to each other and then slowly drift away from me. I've never been past a first round of interviews. I've seen in the eyes of everyone who's ever interviewed me, within 5 minutes of talking to me, that they could not wait to get me out of their office and never respond to an email from me again. My mom barely has an interest in talking to me.

I cannot contribute to the world. No one serious will ever hire me. I could do very low-skill labor, that's about it. My Cornell education will count for nothing. If an interview was part of the admission process, I would have never gotten into Cornell. No one will have my children. And that is a good thing, as if I pass these miserable genes on, my kids will most likely feel the same challenges and be stuck on this planet with no future. So what is the point of my existence... It's been non-stop suffering and loneliness since I became self-aware. I don't want to be alive. But I don't have the guts to kill myself. So the suffering will continue until I die of sadness.
