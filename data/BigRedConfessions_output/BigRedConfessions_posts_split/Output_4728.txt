I'm a freshman, and is it bad that I already have a bad feeling about Cornell? I don't click with anyone on my floor or in my orientation group, and I'm really scared that it's not going to get better from here. I miss home so much and there's a long way to go before Christmas. Can anyone tell me, from experience, if it tends to improve? I'm already thinking about transferring...
