I'm starting to run out of friends who I can chat when I'm terrified, because I'm pretty sure I've bothered so many of them too many times already. I've left pieces of myself with them, hoping they'll take away that fear from my life, but honestly every piece that I drop only becomes another secret I have to worry about spreading.
