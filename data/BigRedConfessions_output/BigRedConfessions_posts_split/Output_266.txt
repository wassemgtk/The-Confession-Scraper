I'm feeling particularly lonely tonight. I've never had a boyfriend. I've never had a first kiss. I was never even asked to a high school dance. No one ever seems interested in me and I don't know what I'm doing wrong. I've always been academically focused, but I find time to let loose. I go out ...a lot. I think I have a keen sense of fashion. I keep up with politics, pop culture, art, you name it. I work out. I care about the people around me. Yet, for some reason it seems like there is a big warning sign painted on my forehead. How do I take it off?
