I think my (opposite gender) best friend of 9 years at another college 1,000+ miles away is starting to develop feelings for me. I think they realize that despite their pursuit of a significant other, a 6-month ordeal with someone won't ever result in the kind of special, deeply-rooted relationship that we've built and couldn't possibly develop with someone else.
