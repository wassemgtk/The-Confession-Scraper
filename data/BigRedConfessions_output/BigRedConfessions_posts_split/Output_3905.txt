I found a $50 bill near the Cornell Store. At first I was excited, but then I felt really bad for the person who had lost it. I looked around but there was no one in sight (this was around 11PM). I cannot in good conscience spend this money and I can't return it. If it's yours I'm so sorry, but I won't believe you. So I've decided to donate it. I have a few organizations in mind, but I am open to suggestions!
