I got back to Cornell and things fell into place perfectly.  I suddenly got everything and it all happened without my trying.     So why do I suddenly feel so depressed all the time? For a guy with everything going for him, I must be a complete dumbass.  I'm surrounded 24/7 but feel completely alone.  And the trouble is, nobody seems to even care.
