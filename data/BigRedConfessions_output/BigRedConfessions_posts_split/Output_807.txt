Part of being me is knowing that a good thing will always be followed up by bad news. I should've learned by now to not get excited about things but I still make the same mistakes. The only thing I have to rely on is hard work. I can do that. It's something I can control. But some days I just don't have it in me to continue though. On some days, like today, it all seems hopeless.
