Girl sitting across from me in Olin - your headphones are super loud. The guy next to me told you to turn your music down and you did for about 15 mins, then turned it back up again. If dirty looks don't work on you over the next 5 mins, I'll be the next to tell you. I think the bigger issue here is - how can people study with music blaring in their ears. I can't study with even a tiny bit of noise, let alone an AC/DC concert taking place in my head.
