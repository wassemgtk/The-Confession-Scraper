I am so happy to have finally started working today after graduating a few weeks back from Cornell 🐻. I work at a power plant in Pennsylvania and the reason I enjoy my job is because I can feel like I've got the power - ALWAYS! I power this great country country of doers and parts of the country's infrastructure including NYC and NY state with Pennsylvania and West Virginia coal and natural gas, and my energy is clean, pollution-free, cheap, and reliable. I am glad I decided to work here because I realized that fossil has the greatest energy potential and will ensure our future sucess as a nation. ⚡️⚡️⚡️😎⚡️⚡️⚡️
