Everything that felt wrong, is right again. Yet, I've never felt so vulnerable, naked to evil, intruding eyes. But there is rebirth in my nakedness, the possibility of life deeply grounded in Now. I am surrounded by the present. This may all sound so vague, but there is nothing unclear about my blossoming. You see, I finally realized, I am that flower. Peace, love, and Godspeed to all.
