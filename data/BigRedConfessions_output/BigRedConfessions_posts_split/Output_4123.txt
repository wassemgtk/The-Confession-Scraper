An overwhelming majority of U.S. citizens support a minimum wage that should be raised to living standards. Union activity has also aroused a great deal of public support. National health care is advocated strongly by the public as well. Unfortunately, neither party has acceded to demands of the public. All three of these policies have been repeatedly struck down by the federal government. Why, you ask? Because our politicians have prostituted themselves to the corporate elite. There is no Illuminati, no secret Skull & Bones Satanists, no Freemason scheme, and no Jewish conspiracy to make Israel a world empire. But there are those who have risen to power under our so-called free-market capitalist democracy who seek to maintain their power through their financial dynasties. If you ask me, the West no longer functions as a democracy. It is the Roman Republic/Empire all over again--a plutocracy in which the few heap rewards upon themselves at the expense of the many. The vast majority of our citizens do not have a voice anymore. Short of seeking immortality, most (but probably not all) of these wealth hoarders will employ any and every tactic to centralize their power and maintain it for their following generations of descendants. The rich are not fucking job creators, at least not many of them. By growing complacent and willingly placing ourselves under heavily financed propaganda machines (ahem, Fox--or should I say Fuck--News) we are relinquishing our freedom and unknowingly subjugating ourselves to corporate tyrrany. If you hope to one day join their ranks, know this: they are knowingly making social mobility an outdated concept--it will be harder and harder to climb the ranks into the .01 percent.
