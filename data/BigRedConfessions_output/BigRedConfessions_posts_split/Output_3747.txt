"It seems absolutely crazy to me that all this has happened over the course of one year. In one year, I fell in love, lost a friend, matured in my sexuality, was heartbroken, tried a lot of drugs, fell in and out of depression, discovered my true friends, came to terms with my eating disorder, and talked someone out of committing suicide.

Unfortunately, all those experiences seem lost when I try to balance them with my academic career. It's so hard for me to get to intimately know my peers, to participate in the happens of everyday, and to lend myself to those who need me, when I have to turn in homework I dread doing. 

I'm not sure of my major anymore. I am barely scraping by with my grades. I am constantly questioning whether I should be on the streets protesting the disgusting police brutality, murder, and injustice of country is facing. I'm doing my best to not just ""say"" I want to help, but actually do something, but it's hard when I have papers and tests and vocabulary to memorize.

I know that a world-class education from this school will give me the means by which I can help the world. Knowledge is key in our battle and taking the time to truly educate myself is the first step in preparing myself to support those who could use my help. 

But aren't all those times I hold my friend when she cries important too? When I spend an hour talking to the homeless man because he lost his job and family and just wants someone to have a conversation with? When I run and get coffee for my friends who are anxious about a test? Is it okay for me to risk making a deadline if it means I brighten someone else's day?

I am all over the place. I'm trying to experience each day to the fullest but I also want to build a foundation for greatness. I feel I am being pulled in so many directions and I have no idea what path to follow. I just want the best for everyone. I have a big heart and big dreams, but I sometimes wonder if I'll even graduate.
