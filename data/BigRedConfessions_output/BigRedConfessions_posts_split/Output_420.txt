"My partner and I recently got into electrical play, and it is everything I could have possibly hoped it would be. 

(For vanilla folks, electrical play is sexual kink which involves hooking up various intriguing attachments to a device that discharges static electricity and/or making my body into a conductor so that my fingers, lips, feet, conductive objects which I hold,  etc. discharge static electricity whenever I touch people. It's a great way to control your sub(s) or just spice things up in the bedroom.) 

Tesla coil guy/gal from post #7665, you should totally come play with us, so long as we don't talk politics! 

And PSA, Kink Lab's power tripper attachment is amazing and, if you're interested in this stuff, make sure neither you nor anyone you decide to play with has a heart condition, pacemaker, etc. Come to Cornell Crunch meetings sometime for more discussion and info! "
