I have a lot of siblings. Growing up, we weren't all that close but being away from them has made me miss all of them a lot. I call, I text and on breaks some of us have a lot of fun together. But it scares me what is going to happen in a few years. Like, when I’m out of school and have to work and they’re in high school and college and working in other places, what’s going to happen? I didn't realize that when high school ended, our times all being altogether ended too. One is already moving to a different country! People say you can always make new friends, but you can’t make new family! This isn't a big problem but for me, it’s still sad. Is anyone in the same boat?
