Last night I cheated on my boyfriend when I was supposed to be studying for a final with a friend of mine. I didn’t mean to; it kinda just happened and now I feel really bad. I’m hoping I can use winter break to get over it and forget about it so I can finally look my boyfriend in the eyes again. Little does he know when I say goodbye to him the guilt I’m feeling inside
