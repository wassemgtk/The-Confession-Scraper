This is my beautiful country and I love it! I love the Constitution, the military, the police, the nuclear family, and America's most efficient manufacturing and energy production workforce. The US is finally becoming the number one oil and gas producer in the world. I buy only American-made products that go to supporting Americans working and keeping money in our country making it stronger by helping our economy. I also donate money to various wounded warrior organizations and police benevolent organizations. Did you know that America is once again respected in the world? The US Passport allows one to travel freely without a visa or instant visa upon arrival, more than any other passport in the world? I feel this campus is so unpatriotic as most students have resentment towards America and it's great institutions, even though Cornell was founded as a land-grant institution with the goal of supporting academic freedom and also training military leaders for the future. Go USA USA USA!
