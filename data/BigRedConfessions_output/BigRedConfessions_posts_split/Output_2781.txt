I had just pulled an all nighter and thought I was half dreaming. I was too embarrassed to stand behind you, so I left the dining hall. The odds of you reading this are slim, and the odds of you caring are even less. 

But I somehow need you to know that the person I was four years ago was only a part of me. And although you probably still think I'm crazy, I really valued the time we had together.
