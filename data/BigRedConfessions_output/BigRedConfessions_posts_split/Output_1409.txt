Please please please people who plays online computer games and stuff like that in your dorm, please play somewhere else! It is really disruptive when your roommate is yelling every 5 seconds at a computer screen and chatting with his friends. I'm literally about to snap because of this. Buy headphones atleast. And don't shout. Seriously. It's a game.

So done right now.
