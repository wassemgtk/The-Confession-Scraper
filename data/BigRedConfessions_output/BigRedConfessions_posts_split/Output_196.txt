"You say the price of my love’s not a price that you’re willing to pay. You cry in your tea which you hurl in the sea when you see me go by. Why so sad? Remember we made an arrangement when you went away. Now you’re making me mad. Remember, despite our estrangement, I’m your man. You’ll be back, soon you’ll see, you’ll remember you belong to me, you’ll be back, time will tell, you’ll remember that I served you well. Oceans rise, empires fall, we have seen each other through it all, and when push comes to shove I will send a fully armed battalion to remind you of my love!"

Sometimes I just feel like King George in this relationship of ours ... Far away and like you think I'm insane. You want a battalion? Get ready. You'll be back, just you wait and see.
