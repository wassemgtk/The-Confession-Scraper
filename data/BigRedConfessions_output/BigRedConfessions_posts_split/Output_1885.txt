I'm a CS/ECE double major (there are lots of us, so I'm not really naming myself here) and sometimes I wonder if this is really what I want. I'm putting in hours of work for classes that I really enjoy, but I find solidarity from joining communities on campus and helping other people out. I like making people smile with my music and helping people out randomly without really knowing them. I want to turn 22, leave here, and then make music for everybody to enjoy.

It would be like Maggie Gyllenhaal from Stranger than Fiction (obscure references??), who made people happy with her cookies instead of being a lawyer. It's scary to live as a musician, but I think it'll be more fun than working at some tech firm in Silicon Valley like every other person who majors in CS or ECE here. Don't get me wrong, being a musician isn't really sustainable, and I like what I study here, but at least I can make other people happy by going into music.

The only problem is that I'd have wasted a degree and four years of my life. :(
