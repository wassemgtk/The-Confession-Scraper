I'm about to start sophomore year and it feels weird. I still remember my first hookup in college and it seems as if just yesterday I was one of the many freshies traveling in the large hordes into collegetown to experience my first college party. Now I'll be watching these hordes thinking about what I'd do to relive that moment. But every memory has it's own value. At least now I get to say "I'm a sophomore" without having to lie to upperclassmen :x
