I am afraid to leave my club, even though no one cares about me in it and barely know who I am. They are all in my major and I feel they will know if I leave and further ostracize me from the group. I will have to see them in my classes and deal with the whispers. I don't know what to do, I lose either way. We are having a really big event this week but I can't do it anymore, I don't know who to talk to because I know they won't understand or take me seriously.
