American Express just raised my limit to $25,000. I'm 22. I can't stress the importance of having several credit cards and building up your credit, guys. I've run into so many people who are just opposed to credit cards on principle; don't know which ones to get; or have just 1 that their parents got for them; generally refuse to think for themselves when it comes to credit and finances. Trust me, I have 5 credit cards, I use them all for different things to maximize rewards, they make me hundreds of dollars every year, and I've never paid a cent in interest. I get the best offers, and by the time I have to get a mortgage I'll have stellar credit. And all it cost me was doing some research and some basic planning. Saying that credit cards will get you into debt is like saying that food will make you fat. Don't be dumb, get a credit card ASAP. A big part of your credit score is how long you've had a credit line, so the sooner you have one, the better off you'll be in the long term.
