"I may not be that popular with girls here at Cornell, but it's fucking ridiculous what they do when they reject me. They apologize, they justify slut shaming, they blame everything but the assholes who try to blame it on them for not wanting every guy that happens to want them.

Ladies, don't feel ashamed or embarassed for turning guys down. If they can't deal with that, they do not deserve courtesy in denial. Please, please do not apologize when you turn me down."
