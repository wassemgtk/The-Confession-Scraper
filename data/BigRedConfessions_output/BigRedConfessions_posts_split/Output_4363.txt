I wish surveys, colleges, exams, etc. could put a separate category for South Asians when they ask for race. I find it really stupid that only in America are people of the subcontinent considered non-Asian. I always have to put down "Other" and it make me feel as if I'm a member of some sort of exotic people on the verge of extinction with a total population of 10. Although a better alternative would be not asking for race at all...
