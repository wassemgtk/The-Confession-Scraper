I think you and I would be such a power couple.

You're incredibly smart, talented, and I really don't know what you can't do (seriously!)
It's also been such a long time since I've met somebody who could make me laugh so hard besides my girlfriends.
I love that you're so ambitious and that you can play hard to get...it just makes every sweet little thing you do or say mean so much more to me!

But of course...nothing's perfect.

It's really a shame...and I hate that it bothers me so much deep inside and I really, really try to not let it bother me.
Growing up my parents always told me that Christianity and good faith came first in a relationship. Now that I'm older and my family is starting to accept that I'll be dating more seriously...they're pushing it on me more than ever.
I can understand why and I owe so much to my family. Family is really important to me! But I just feel so conflicted using "faith" as criteria when I think about dating.

I love God and it would only be a plus if you were also a firm-believer, but I love you so much anyway.
and I know you love me back. Isn't that all that matters?
