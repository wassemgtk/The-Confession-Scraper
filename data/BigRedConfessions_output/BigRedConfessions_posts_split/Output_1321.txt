Cornell has increased my anxiety and depression so much to the point where I feel as if suicide would be the only suitable answer to submitting my paper 3 days late. This university has historically punished me severely for missteps like late assignments, so my own demise seems easier to face than an unforgiving professor telling me that I am going to fail his class. Not to mention, I am a senior who is already on academic warning, so if I get a low grade its over for me. Failed class=no degree=no job=no way to survive. I am lost.
