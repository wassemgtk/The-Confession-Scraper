There is this guy that I really like. When I hang out with him we get along so well and I get the feeling that he likes me too. But on days I don't see him I don't hear anything from him at all. I can see on Facebook when he was last online and what events he is attending so I can basically cluster together his life but I would so much prefer him telling me what he is up to. It is really frustrating to see the difference between personal and internet communication, it's like I'm talking to a different person.
