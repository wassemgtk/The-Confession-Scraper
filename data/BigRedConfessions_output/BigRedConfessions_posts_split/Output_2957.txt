I'm completely floored by the incompetence of all of the TA's and grad students at Cornell. Only one of the TA's I've had so far, across five departments, has been good. Just last week, in one Econ section, the PhD student / TA consistently mangled terms (referring to excise taxes as "exercise" taxes), couldn't solve a two-variable system of equations (in a class that requires multivariable calculus), and couldn't understand student questions. I can understand that some TA's have difficulty with English, and while this particular TA isn't a native English speaker, he or she studied economics as an undergraduate in America. Cornell clearly doesn't take grad students based on their ability to teach, but hoped at the very least that they'd at least be proficient in the fields that they study.

Does anyone else feel the same way? Or have I just been unlucky enough to get all of the bad TA's?
