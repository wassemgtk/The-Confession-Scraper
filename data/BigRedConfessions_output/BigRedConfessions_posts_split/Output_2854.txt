I'm in a fraternity. I have a fair amount of friends. I've gotten a decent amount of female attention here so far. People often describe me as funny and intelligent when they put the effort into getting to know me.

Yet in spite of all of these things, and in spite of my relative social success here at Cornell, all it takes is one person to think I'm weird or boring or unattractive. That's all it takes to bring back all of my pent up social anxiety from years spent as a middle school and high school loser, and it takes a lot more effort to make it go away than it does to bring it on.
