To the awesome students who work for the Tatkon Center:

Thanks for the warm "hellos" and "have a good night" every time I walk in and out of the center. Maybe it's cause you guys can see the stress written all over my face or you guys are just genuinely cheerful. Just wanted to let you guys know, your greetings always make me feel a lot better in the midst of all the work and stress. Stay awesome! :)
