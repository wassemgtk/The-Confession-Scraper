As someone who flies thousands of miles per month and with severe depression (unrelated to Cornell), its been very intriguing to try to get in the mind of the Germanwings copilot and why he decided to bring his plane down with 150 souls on board. 

One of the things I've arrived to is that the decisions you make as a depressed person aren't necessarily yours. In fact, even making a simple decision (what to eat for lunch) sometimes seems like the hardest decision ever. Because of that, you sometimes arrive to decisions that you know aren't the right ones, without having the willpower to think about the consequences. 

Needless to say, however, he shouldn't have been flying.
