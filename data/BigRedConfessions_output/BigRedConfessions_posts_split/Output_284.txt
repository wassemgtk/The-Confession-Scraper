I feel as though someone who has been very close to me for a long time has been making me feel guilty a lot lately.  It's weird because I have been doing great lately but every once in a while I get zapped with negativity. The only reason I feel guilty is because these messages/signals keep appearing.  It feels like this person is holding onto something and not giving me unconditional love as I have always given to them and always will.  Sometimes things change and it is okay to adjust and move forward in a new light.
