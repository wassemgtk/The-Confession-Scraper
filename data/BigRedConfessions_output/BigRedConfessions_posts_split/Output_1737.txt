I read Confession #6306 and even though I'm only a freshman I'm already really pissed off at Cornell too (the gov department).  I took AP US Gov & Politics and AP Comparative Government & Politics and got 5's on both of them, expecting to place out of the gov intro classes. Of course, the year that I come to Cornell they change its policies so I absolutely have to take the intro classes. So I enroll myself in Intro to US Gov GOVT 1111 and I absolutely hate it. For someone passionate about politics and government, I find intro to US gov horrifically boring, redundant, and makes me hate my major so far. "The national government reigns supreme to the states" echoed through the lecture hall for 2 weeks. "Blacks are more likely to be democrats". No shit. For students who already want to pursue a major and has already had high scores on AP/IB classes that clearly cover the intro material, just let us move on. I'm paying thousands of dollars to read the same textbook I used in high school, forced to sit through information I already know.
