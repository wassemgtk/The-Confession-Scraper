I'm a CS major, but sometimes feel like I shouldn't be.

Well, I think I possess the mental ability to learn all the stuff I need to learn, but I just don't have the time to do it unless I take 12 credits a semester or something (aka something I cannot do if I hope to graduate on time). If the average kid takes x amount of time to learn something, I take 5x amount of time to pick up a working knowledge of the same subject. It's hard to focus on the actual learning when I feel like I'm perpetually running a race that I'm losing. 

And for those who say that learning is a journey and not a race or whatever, when your grades are set by being compared to everyone else's grades, it is a fucking race. There's no time for me to stop and smell the roses and appreciate being here. 

I know there are a lot of resources like office hours and stuff, and believe me, I go and ask questions. But my understanding is so far behind that of the average student, and there's literally zero time to bridge that gap because of the nonstop onslaught of things that I need to get done. As a result, getting a project done basically involves crying to some TA or a friend in the class until he/she relents and feeds me small parts of the answers. 

This makes me feel really fucking gross. Why can't I ever experience the process of figuring stuff out by myself? I guess I could, but I'd turn in everything late then. Or I can continue doing what I do now AKA whoring myself out for answers because of 73489204789748932074983743 impending deadlines.  

I like the subject, I really do. CS involves some really cool stuff. But how on earth can I ever enjoy it if I'm always struggling like this? I feel like the only solution to this problem is go back by like five years and start learning what I need to learn now all the way back then. Of course, that's out of the picture. 

I don't know, maybe I just need to study harder. Study more. Sleep less. Socialize less. Work while eating and eat while working.  But there's only so much of all that you can do without totally reaching the point of mental breakdown.  

I used to think I was unbreakable, but this place is pretty close to breaking me.
