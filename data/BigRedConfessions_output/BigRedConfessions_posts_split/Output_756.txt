Typical problem: I'm just a girl who fell in love with a boy, graduated, and never even introduced myself to him. He was the last person in the world who I would ever expect to have a girlfriend, but surprisingly, he ended up with someone good for him. Maybe it's just nostalgia for Cornell, but I find myself thinking a lot about him these days and what might have been. I don't know if we'll ever cross paths again, but if we do, I'll be sure to actually talk to you this time instead of just barely meeting your eyes.
