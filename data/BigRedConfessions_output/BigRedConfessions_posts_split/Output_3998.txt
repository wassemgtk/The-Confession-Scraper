"This confession isn't very anonymous. Anyone reading this post who knows me will also know that I wrote it.

This semester, I wrote a novel. I wrote it for a lot of different reasons, but, in a lot of ways, I wrote it to cope with my own depression. For the past few years at this school, I've been pretty unhappy and lonely. It actually took me by surprise; I wasn't this way in high school, but there you go. Things change, people change, and nothing stays in place.

But I've always liked stories. So I channeled that, or maybe I just distracted myself. I created a little world, full of places I wished I could go to, people I wished I could meet, and characters who felt as unhappy as I did, but for better and more interesting reasons. I built a fictional place that I could kind of understand; it didn't have clear answers, but at least it had a few clear questions.

Writing kept me busy. It kept me engaged. It gave me something to do between classes and on late weekend nights in my dorm room, between the problem sets and exams.

But the book's done now, for the most part. Things have gone back to the way they were before. I feel lonely and sad again. And it doesn't seem like anyone will ever read my book. I'm going to try, but getting published is like one in a million. I can't even get my friends here at Cornell to read it; nobody has the time.

I guess I get that. But if I can't even convince people who know me to look it over, then what chance do I have with a literary agent or a publisher?

I'm pretty depressed at this point. I don't know what I'll do now. I guess I've got fewer things to distract me from classes. But I've also got fewer things to distract me from my thoughts. 

I guess I'll just work on finishing this semester well. And the one after that, and then the one after that. I have goals. I have plans. But I still feel really alone.

I need to think of other things. Thanks for reading.

[Take a creative writing class next semester, or try to find a professor that specializes in the genre your novel is in. Good luck!]
