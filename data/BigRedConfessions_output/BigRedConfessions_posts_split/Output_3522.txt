You totally seem like a great guy!  AND I’M SO GOSH DARN SHY I DON’T KNOW HOW IN THE WORLD I’D TRY TALKING TO YOU AGAIN.  At least I’m feeling shy right now.  Or antisocial.  I don’t know.  

Ugh.  

I mean, I might do it, if I get the chance at the right moment.  But who’s to say when the right moment exactly is?  I think any moment might be the right moment, which is slightly upsetting cause I’ve let a few pass by, especially in dining halls… :) BUT it’s a new semester!  A new beginning!  New opportunities!  Maybe I’ll try to think less and just act, because I think thinking incubates fears, which then inhibit actions.  And I’m a thinker.  So maybe I’ll try to think less?????????????????  

Also, I have to say, you have an amazing smile.  

If this may pertain to you, or maybe even if it doesn’t, talk to that gal (or person) you think might like you!  Don’t think too much!  Ask her to go ice-skating or maybe to grab a bite to eat.  Or maybe she’ll have mustered up enough non-thinking courage herself and say something more to you.  Maybe these kinds of interactions aren’t all that rare.  Maybe you’ll both stop posting confessions and just talk to each other!
