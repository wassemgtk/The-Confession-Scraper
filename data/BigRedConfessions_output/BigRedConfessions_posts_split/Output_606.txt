My roommate and I both rushed. I got cut, she got a bid. I'm fine with it - I rushed just to see what it all was about and honestly, i didn't really find my fit either. But now she is acting so above me - constantly commenting on her sorority/her new friends/how she has so many events/they are showering her with gifts/etc. I know that she's excited, but i can't believe how insensitive she is. She's started to act so much more stuck up in general. Just little things, like not even making an effort to be quiet when I'm trying to sleep. and making looks/backhanded comments on my appearance or clothes. I don't know how I'm going to survive another term with her.
