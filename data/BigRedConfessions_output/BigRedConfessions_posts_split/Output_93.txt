"Hi everyone. I know this isn't really a Confession, but I really need some help/advice on this issue.
Right now I'm not having too much trouble paying for tuition. But in the near future my savings will run out and I don't think financial aid will cover too much of my tuition. I'm only a freshman right now studying MechE. But I was wondering:

Has anyone had success working at internships in NYC during the year? Obviously it would be a very stressful semester and it would be nearly impossible if you have labs and such classes. But I've heard that some companies do allow a certain portion of their work to be completed at home. So maybe it's possible to spend half the week in the city and half the week in Ithaca? Has this been done before?"
