I'm a freshman and am scared as shit about Greek life and being hazed. Half the battle is that there's such an overwhelming pressure to join a fraternity/sorority to augment your social life, and everyone seems to be in a rat race to prove how "in the loop" they are to the whole process. The other half is realizing what you actually could be getting into, and reading about some of the hazing you'd never know about before rushing one of these organizations has kept me up at night in fear of a psychologically grueling experience.
