Dear Random Girl who is "studying" next to me right now. 

WTF? 
Firstly, why can't you just chill out? Seriously, all I want to do is just do my thing but you're always in my space. If I try to read, you just take the paper out of my hands. So relentless. Even right now, just let me type woman! Calm down!

Secondly, if you want to hold hands, just say so. You're so touchy-feely right now, why don't you just be more direct?  If you're trying to hit on me you're doing a really shitty job. Oops, sorry, I forgot you don't cuss.

Thirdly, literally, WTF. Girl, get your shit together. This is getting ridiculous! You keep killing my mojo. I'm trying to do stuff here. Just .... just .... okay! You probably don't even get that reference bc you're too busy watching The Office. HIMYM. Watch it! Go back to your physics. I need to work.  

Sincerely, the really annoyed dude who was trying to get work done before you started getting weird. I thought we had something. Now we'll never know.
