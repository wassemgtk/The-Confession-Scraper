I've been tempted to cheat on my girlfriend several times recently. Some really good looking, smiling and smart girls have shown interest on me (like 3 over the last 2 months). Don't get me wrong, I know when I am in the friendzone or not. Sigh... although I politely avoid them, they send me random texts, fb messages... I'll keep my loyalty to my gf. I pray every day to avoid doing something wrong. I was cheated on by another gf and I don't wish this to anyone.
