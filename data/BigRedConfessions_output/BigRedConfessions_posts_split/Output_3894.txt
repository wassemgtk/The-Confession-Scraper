I thought that the Mindfulness (Meditation thing that Gannett offers for free) was kind of a bullshit for crazy people. Even though I am NOT freaking out, I decided to give it a shot. Dude, that thing is so awesome! Itâ€™s a guided nap. You should try regardless you are feeling well or bad. It will make you more productive - trust me.
