I recently survived two near-death experiences with relatively little damage from causes that were completely out of my control and not my fault. I've been told to thank god for allowing me to live but lately I've been thinking he intentionally tried to put me out of my misery.
I have been extremely depressed and lonely lately with little motivation to even get up in the morning. Is it possible that God wants to kill me out of mercy?

Also, as a sidenote to those that respond, i am not christian nor do i wish to convert.
