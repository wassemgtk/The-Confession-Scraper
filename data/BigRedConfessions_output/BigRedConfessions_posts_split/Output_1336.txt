I'm so incredibly lonely. I feel like I'm in a glass case and there are constantly people around me but I can't connect with them regardless of how much I want to. There are people that I should be able to talk to about how I feel and that I'm sure would care but I can't bring myself to do anything about it. I don't want pity. I don't want to die. But I cannot say that I want to live, and that indifference is the worst part.
