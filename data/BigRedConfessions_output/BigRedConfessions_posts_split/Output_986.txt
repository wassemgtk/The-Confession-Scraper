To the Brazilian guy who great me on the street to Collegetown, at the same time last year: You stopped across me saying I'm very cute and asking for a hug, when I was holding my birthday cake walking towards Collegetown. You kinda scared me but you were really warm! You lighted me up in the cold weather. Wish you are having a good thanksgiving and a beautiful year! I've met Brazilian people who hug me and my friend as soon as we get of the bus and see them for the first sight. I like the waaaarm culture!
