Fuck! After a wonderful spring break here at Ithaca...silence, peace, and quiet, and all... my roommate is back. And people are slowly coming back to campus. This week made me realize how much I love not being forced to talk to people and just deal with people in general. I realized how much I love living alone in my own space without having to hear my roommate doing stuff in the background. I might sound selfish and egoistic but I really do love spending time with myself. This week I have really focused and concentrated on loving myself as this was a struggle for me for a long time now. And I was doing so good until people started crawling back to campus. I just wish I didn't have to say "hi!" to my hall mate or anyone for that matter. I wish I just could go about doing my business without really having the need to do small talks with people and truly not caring about it. Don't get me wrong! I want to make human connections but I want to have quality conversations with people, to understand them, and to embrace them. But I really don't want to fucking deal with petty socializing.
