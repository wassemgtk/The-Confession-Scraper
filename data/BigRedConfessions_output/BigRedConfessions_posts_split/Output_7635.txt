I have a problem. I know its wrong but I can't stop. Every night, when I go to the dining hall I eat a banana, however, I do not discard the peel. Instead, I fold the peel up and stuff it in my jacket, smuggling it out of the dinning hall. Every night I do this and I cannot stop. My purpose is to fill my backpack up with banana peels, and once it is full, run around campus dressed up as Wario, throwing banana peels from my backpack as it is strapped to the front of my body and distribute them everywhere. Then I will have the most epic evil laugh as I watch countless students slip on my peels and plummet to the ground. Regardless of how unhealthy I know this is, I cannot stop, I will not stop.
