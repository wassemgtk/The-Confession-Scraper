I know I said your hookup didn't bother me that much, but it really did.  It wasn't a dealbreaker, but it just made me feel like I never mattered, like it was so easy for you to just move on to another girl as soon as we broke up.  It really made me feel like shit.  I'm having a hard time looking back on us positively.
