To #5271:

I'm truly sorry for knocking over your bubble tea, and that you were having a rough night. I just wish you had accepted my offer to pay you back right then, instead of angrily brushing me off and then later posting about resenting me on a public forum. I have feelings too :) For the sake of resolution, if you have Venmo, comment below and I'll gladly repay you twice the amount you requested.
