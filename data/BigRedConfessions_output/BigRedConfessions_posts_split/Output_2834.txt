We met at the pledge party saturday night. you introduced yourself and complimented me and i did the same back, though it was too loud to say much more. when the party ended, i got caught in the crowd and by the time i made it out you were gone, but something about the look you gave, the way you smiled, and the way you were having such a genuinely great time just dancing was such a turn on. i haven t been able to get it out of my head.
