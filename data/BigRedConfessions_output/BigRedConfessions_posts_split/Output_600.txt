After watching Trump's Wounded Warrior and Veterans event yesterday in Iowa and missing the stupid Megyn Kelly-moderated debate on Fox News, I have noticed we are no longer the silent majority. I liked how the lady sang the National Anthem, reminding me of a video I saw on Youtube of the National Anthem being sung with a strong voice in the 1940's unlike most of today's weak squeaky voice singers. We are the majority and as a Cornell student from Iowa, my family is going out to vote in the Caucus to make America Great Again. I already voted on my absentee ballot! I can't wait until January 20, 2017!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
