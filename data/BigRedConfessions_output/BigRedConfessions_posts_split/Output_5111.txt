Cornell's infatuation with Keystone Light really confuses me. Like, I get it, it's cheap, and you can get a lot of it. But why not other low-end beer? Why do you never see Busch Light or Natty? Does the City of Ithaca only recognize the legitimacy of the Coors Brewing Company, or are we just so in the middle of nowhere that Anheuser-Busch refuses to stock the local stores? What's up.
