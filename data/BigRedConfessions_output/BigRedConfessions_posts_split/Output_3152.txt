I've always liked you but I've never told you. I put a wall against you and me because you were dating someone and I didn't want to come between you two. I said no to riding on your shoulders for slope day, to playing beer pong, to hanging out sometimes because you weren't mine. If I hang out with you too long, I realize the greatness about you and my feelings for you come back. I've never had a chance with you because you were in relationships from when I first met you to now. I watched you play your happy life from a distance, while also lightly liking others as well. Now that you're out of that last, you're into one of our other best friends. I wish I had  a chance.
