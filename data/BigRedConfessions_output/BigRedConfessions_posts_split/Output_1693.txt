I used to be good at school and, when I needed it, I also used to be good at faking my confidence in my abilities. Everyone at Cornell is better than me at school and everyone is better than me at faking their confidence in their abilities. Iâ€™m a sophomore and I've dug myself into such a deep whole of self-doubt that I don't think I'll ever see the daylight again.
