For those drug addicts out their who do illegal drugs on Cornell's campus, I support the death penalty for drug traffickers and abusers like in Singapore. I personally think that anyone convicted of abusing illegal drugs out there should be forced to a mandatory exception watching someone get fried on the electric chair who traffics illegal drugs. I think they would quickly fix their addiction watching Ol' Sparky do her job.
