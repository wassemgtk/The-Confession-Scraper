I'm shadowing doctors at a hospital this summer and I really like one of the young doctors there. I've caught him staring at me more than once but maybe I'm just seeing what my heart wants me to see. I'm kind of inexperienced when it comes to guys; I've never been in a relationship and I've never really liked any guy. So this feeling is overwhelmingly new to me.......*sigh*
