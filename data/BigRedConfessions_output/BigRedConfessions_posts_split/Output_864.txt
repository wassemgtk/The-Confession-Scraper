I got rejected from Cornell today. I didn't think I would be this upset, but I was a mess when I found out. I really loved Cornell because I thought the student culture was special, and I didn't think I could find that kind of environment anywhere else. I'm trying to make myself feel better so I'm making a list of the things I don't like about Cornell. So far, I only have oneâ€”the awful weather.
