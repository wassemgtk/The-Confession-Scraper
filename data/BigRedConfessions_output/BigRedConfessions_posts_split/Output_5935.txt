my boyfriend is graduating this semester. i still have a year left in ithaca. we have been putting off the discussion about the future of our relationship. we have a great relationship so i think he'll wait for me. but i am scared. before he transferred to Cornell a couple of years ago, he ended his long term relationship when he started dating me. even though i benefited from him breaking up with his ex, i am afraid of that happening to me. he says he loves me. but does he love me enough to keep the relationship going? i guess i'll find out soon.
