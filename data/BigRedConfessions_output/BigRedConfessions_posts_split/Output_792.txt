So after my first semester at Cornell, my GPA is a 4.06. How excited about this should I be? I'm taking harder courses next semester because I came here to be challenged. I don't want to become overconfident and overload myself, but I really want to put myself to the test and see what I'm capable of. I've never gotten below an A- in my life, and I want to have my first B, because that will mean that I was challenged and learned a lot and focused on my learning rather than the grade. Idk what advise do people have? I don't usually talk about my grades and GPA because I don't want to brag, so I kind of wanted to let off this steam and excitement. I mean, I have a 4.06 at Cornell, a big scary Ivy where I was worried about failing! Am I celebrating too soon? It must get harder from here.
