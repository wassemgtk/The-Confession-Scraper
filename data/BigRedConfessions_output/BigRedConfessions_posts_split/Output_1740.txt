I'm a non-traditional student here. I'm an undergraduate in my mid-20's. Needless to say, it's really hard to make friends. There are plenty of people who approach me wanting to be friends, but then it always gets to an awkward turning point. Most scenarios with girls go something like: "Are you in a sorority?" "No." "Really? Why Not?" "I'm in my mid-20s." Most scenarios with guys go something like: *Guy flirts a lot* "You know, I'm in my mid-20s." And that's that. I hope there are people here (undergraduate or otherwise) who wouldn't be completely weirded out being friends with someone in their mid-20s.
