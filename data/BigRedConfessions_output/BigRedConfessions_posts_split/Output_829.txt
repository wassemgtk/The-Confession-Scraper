Many of you post on here complaining how you didn't get accepted and how you're grades aren't exactly up to par due to the difficulty of the curriculum, atmosphere, etc. Some of you might even give up on your dreams because of how far south things have gone. But I just wanted to add some fresh perspective to this notion of the ""pristine"" college student with the best internships who ends up becoming a roaring success. I have personally known students who have come from even the shittiest of colleges and have made a name for themselves on Wall Street, medicine, and engineering. The schools you attend only tell part of the story. One person I know actually went to a school ranked something in the 600s and had an acceptance rate of 75%. But today she's working as an equity research analyst for a top tier bank in NYC. I also know of 1 individual who lacks a technical background, attended a so-called ""crap"" school and has just received 4 million in venture fund capital for his start-up. My own friend who was at the bottom of our high school class, went to a large state school, is today going to a well-respected medical school. 

The fact that you got into and succeeded at Cornell does not make you any better or worse than anyone else. But if you're a student at this school, there's a damn good chance that you have some hidden potential within you. 

Success does not come down to just your academic pedigree, your grades, and your fancy internships. Passion and hard work count for a great deal in this world. It might take some time and some luck..but I'm certain that most of you can achieve your dreams as well. 

Good Luck
