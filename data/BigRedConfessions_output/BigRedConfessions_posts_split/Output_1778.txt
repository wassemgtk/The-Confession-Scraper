When women use the "I'm not sure I'm ready/want to date" excuse after a first date -- while I think it's very polite and very much appreciate their letting me know and considering my feelings -- don't get me wrong ladies, I get it and you're not doing anything wrong. But just from a logical point of view -- how does that argument make sense? You went on a date. It's like getting a job offer after an interview and saying -- "you know, I'm not sure I'm ready to work"...
