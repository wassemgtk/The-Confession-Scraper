#4743 is about me.

It's part of a third person account of my sexual assault last semester. I wrote it in an attempt to step back and make peace with myself. Going through that made me very aware of rape culture. I was judged for thinking about coming forward and told to think about his future, to not ruin his life because I "felt bad." But I was also judged for not coming forward, because that makes me a bad victim. Everyone I've told has made me feel like this is not important, or that it was my fault, they don't think it was a big deal because I had originally given consent, even though it can be taken away. 

Consent is a very complicated issue, and sexual assault is a serious crime, but a lot of students here are very ignorant about the issue even though they think they aren't. I'm ok now, but I still feel the judgement and criticism of people who think I was in the wrong. I know I'm not the only one who has gone/is going through this and I think that's what makes me sad.
