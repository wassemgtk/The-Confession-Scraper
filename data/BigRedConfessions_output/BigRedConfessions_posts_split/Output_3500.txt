I had a completely meaningless hookup with a friend of a friend I was casually seeing from time to time. I don't know why I did it, I wasn't drunk or anything. The guilt hit me the next day, but I was also mad at myself for feeling guilty. There are no rules established in a casual circumstances, so there was no trust or exclusivity to even break in the first place. Also, this person always made me feel shitty and used. What sucks the most is that I'm probably the only one who still thinks about all this.
