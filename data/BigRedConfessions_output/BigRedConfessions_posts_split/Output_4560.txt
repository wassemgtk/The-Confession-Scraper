All the guys here keep talking about how desperate they are for sex and companionship. And as a girl starting out college, I feel the exact same. I recently entered a long distance open relationship with my boyfriend, so now not only do I have the pressures of school and making friends, I have a consistent mindset on wanting to hook up. Though my inability to find likely partners, let alone making friends in the first place, makes it even harder to pursue and makes me feel lonelier than ever.
