Freshman year just having ended for me, I'm begining to wonder if the friendships I made this year will last through the next three years. It feels like those people I used to spend long nights talking about anything and everything have moved on as soon as finals week began. I miss them. I know it'll be alright, but I wish there was some way to make them truly understand that, though they might not value my friendship as highly as I do there's and we will be living far apart, I will always be there for them.
