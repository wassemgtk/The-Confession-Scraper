I made a decision to stop shaving my armpits and legs this fall and winter...At first I felt really self-conscious wearing shorts in the library, but now I'm realizing that I really don't give a shit! I'm a hairy woman, and proud to be... Maybe I want that extra ten minutes in the shower to daydream instead of shaving...Not to mention the extra warmth!! Let it grow, let it grow!
