"I actually hate my friends. All of them. They're constantly laughing at me, mocking the way I am. I've struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts before coming to Cornell and being here has essentially intensified them. 
I know I go around smiling all of the time and taking shit from those around me, but I'm done. My GPA was shit my first semester in part because I spent too much time with people who treat me badly. 
I won't do that anymore, even if that means being alone.
Here's to turning over a new leaf. Wish me luck! :)
