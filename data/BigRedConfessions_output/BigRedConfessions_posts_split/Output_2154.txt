I feel like there are some people here who have known me (not super well) during difficult stages of my life or when I was working through challenging personal problems. I'm sure some of them thought I was weird, crazy, or maladjusted at the time. I wish I could show some of them how much better I'm doing now even if it doesn't really matter at this point.
