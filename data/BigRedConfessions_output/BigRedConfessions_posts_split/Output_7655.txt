COMMENT FOR THE ADMINS:  Can you put a limit on how many confessions you put out in one day?  Was talking with some friends and it gets overwhelming (for our newsfeeds and reading the page) when you post 25 in a row.  It also means a lot of the confessions don't get read because they are at the bottom...

[oops... I just posted like 40, didn't I? I'm working on getting more admins so that I'm not just waiting for the list to fill, then bulk-posting them between my classes. We'll see!]
