Being sober on Libe Slope on Slope Day is a considerably strange experience. I saw people practically having sex against a tree and people hooking up in the bathroom along the sides. I heard a couple speaking to each other about how them having wealth makes them more intelligent. I heard how horrible Chance and Magic were. And saw all the drunk Cornell students cheering them on. I saw a girl crying because she lost a ticket for food. I just finished my freshman year and I'm questioning my choice of coming to this school.
