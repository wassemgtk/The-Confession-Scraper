Although after each time I complained to you for not being a real friend, you got pissed and mad and said I'm just ungrateful. So I would quickly apologize for being mean. And then this would happen again a couple weeks later... 
After this last time u stopped talking to completely when I pass you. But although I told u that was wrong and your just so awesome in every way.... I wasn't wrong.... And your a fucking asshole.  My life has been no different before my complaint and after. We don't do anything less as we never did anything together before because we weren't actually friends!!! So now that I think I'm finally over it, I'll make some actual friends and u can fuck off.
