I wasn't any teacher's favorite student in high school. I was a quite guy and barely spoke. One other student, X, was almost all of my teachers favorite. We both applied to Cornell and I got in and he did not. He got into NYU and all my teachers were happy and proud of him, and nobody recognized my achievement, not even our college counselor. Even though I got into two ivies and X got into none, he got recognized in the graduation for his accomplishments and they did not even have a word for me. Only my mom was proud of me even though she had no idea about Cornell or about American education system in general. Today, after 2 years when Cornell came up as #11 university in the world, I was proud of myself and my university. I was so excited that I messaged few of my friends about it and they behaved like it is not a not a big deal or whatsoever (they don't even go to a top ranked school at all). I was hurt again, and it made me feel like shit. I feel like my achievements are always gonna go in vain like this and I feel like I will never hear somebody congratulating me for my accomplishments. Now you may say that dude, you are overly sensitive, maybe yeah I am a bit sensitive, but sometimes we all need that support to move forward, I know I have my mom who is happy for me and proud of me, but I need some friend(s) who will also recognize me and help me move forward. Thanks for reading/listening, I am usually not a whiny person like this, this is my first post at Cornell Confessions!
