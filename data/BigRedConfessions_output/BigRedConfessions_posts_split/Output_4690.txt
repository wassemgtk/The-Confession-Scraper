During freshman year, I became very close to one of my hallmates. We would often drink tea together and have a great time talking about everything. This year, we live on opposite sides of campus, so we rarely see each other anymore. I miss her, but I'm not sure if she misses me. She sends me the occasional facebook message or snapchat, but those are all. She's living with her friends and I'm living with mine. Should I let go? I often feel she knows so many people that she wouldn't have time for me. I've always valued our relationship since it has always been strong since we met during orientation last year.
