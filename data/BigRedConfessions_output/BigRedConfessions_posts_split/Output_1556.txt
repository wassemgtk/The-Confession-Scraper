Sometimes when I think of my childhood, I start crying. It was a nightmare filled with racist classmates who would just ignore me, an overworked father who was never home and an unemployed mother going through postpartum depression. Both my parents were strict and used corporal punishment and to this day, I instinctively flinch if I see my mom coming towards me. Not to say that childhood was all bad, but just that it makes me sad think about it now.
