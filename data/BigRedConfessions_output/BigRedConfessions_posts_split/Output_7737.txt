We used to talk but I guess I annoyed you because we don't anymore. I didn't think I had feelings for you but every time I see you something happens, it's weird. I'm not sure what we were, but seeing as that this entire thing was probably a projection of my own need to feel love I think it's time to let you go. But let's be honest, I 10/10 would bang.
