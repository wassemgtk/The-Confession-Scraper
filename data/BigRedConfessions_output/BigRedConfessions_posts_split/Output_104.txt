"Beware guys, something I've recently noticed regarding complimenting girls is, it is an incredibly risky thing to do that can completely backfire and cause them to lose interest. The thing to note is, it is really counterintuitive, at least to me, so you may be thinking you're putting in a lot of effort to come up with the right/specific compliments and you're being sweet, when in fact you are obliviously destroying your chances.

Here's what it is -- do not compliment a girl on something she isn't 100% sure you know about her. Don't say, ""I think you're genuinely sweet"" or something like that if you don't think she thinks you have a basis for that, even if in your mind you have a basis. Because here's what will very likely happen - she'll think (or say) how can you possibly know this about me? Don't make sweeping judgements. You don't know me. She might think you're being too intense. And another thing she might say is - you can't set such expectations for me, I'll end up being disappointing, it's unfair because you don't know me, etc. Of course it depends on the compliment, but this is the general idea.

And the thing is for myself, and I think most guys, none of this crosses my mind. I just wanted to distinguish myself from the crowd, I wanted you to notice me, I wanted to be sweet and clever, and the compliment IS based on some fact, I don't just throw them around. But you must be extremely cautious. In fact it may be better to compliment looks than personality.
I've had this response 5-6 times now to what I considered to be reasonable compliments. It can also come across as being aggressive, which combined with everything else will turn her off to you quickly. This is all of course for the courting stage, if you're complimenting your girlfriend, she will most likely take it as a compliment and not an expectation.

You just need to be casual and cautious with your kind words. That is my downfall - I am intense as much as I try not to be. If I sense someone losing interest, I start telling them why I like them and get into try hard mode and that backfires quickly. But often even if she wasn't losing interest, intensity will cost you. It's almost always a losing strategy, unless she absolutely adores you, it will scare her away, and she may even think you're creepy. So never take anything too seriously, no matter how much you like her. It's really difficult. But realize you'll be working against yourself, and try to use the right part of your brain. Save romantic and more intense stuff for the relationship. In the beginning, you have to be casual (albeit polite and still interested) as much as possible. And beware if compliments."
