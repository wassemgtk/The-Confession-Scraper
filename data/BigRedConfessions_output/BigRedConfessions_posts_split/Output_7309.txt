To the guy who snottily asked me if I'd be leaving soon in Temple of Zeus on Monday, I actually was about to pack up my things. However, your rudeness convinced me to stay there for an extra ten minutes just to piss you off. I'm passive-aggressive and had nowhere else to be. Don't be such an asshole next time and people might do what you want.
