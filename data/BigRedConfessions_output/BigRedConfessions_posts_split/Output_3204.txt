Sometimes, while walking down the streets in Ithaca, I think of my parents in my home country. The lovely people that I have only seen them through Skype during the last few years. Their adorable faces that are always worried of me, those faces that try to show they are happy yet God knows how much they are missing me. I hope one day we can again live close to each other, not thousands miles away. I miss my mother's kiss.
