To the person who dripped honey all over Bethe House and went into a couple of suites to steal items. I thought I would be angry but I am just really sad. Yo we go to Cornell but I guess stealing and defacing your fellow classmates stuff is OK? I don't give a crap if your drunk, if you can't hold your alcohol to keep enough sense in your system you shouldn't be drinking
