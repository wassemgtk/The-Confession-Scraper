I just feel like those of my friends who I really care about don't really care about me, at least not as what I feel towards them. I also feel so lonely because I can find someone that I can share my happiness and sadness... Even at Friday night, I always feel lonely because I can't find someone to hang out with... I don't know why, I am not an ugly girl...
