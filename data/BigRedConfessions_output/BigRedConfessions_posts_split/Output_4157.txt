You told me you still wanted to be friends.  That was a either a flat out lie, or you were telling the truth and just a not worth my time. Looking back, I can't believe we were friends for so long, how I defended you for so long. I cared about you way more than you deserve, I kept the door open way longer than I should have; my conscience is clear. I just wish I realized it all sooner.
