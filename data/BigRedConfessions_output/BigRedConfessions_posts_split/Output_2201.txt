Some of you people need to get your fucking heads out of your asses and realize there are other ways to build experience than getting a fucking internship. BELIEVE IT OR NOT there are these things called summer jobs that NORMAL college students do rather than some prestigious internship. Additionally, BELIEVE IT OR NOT 100% of Cornell can't get these internships because they're selective so IF YOU DON'T FIND AN INTERNSHIP GET A FUCKING JOB THAT WILL HELP YOU GET AN INTERNSHIP NEXT SUMMER GOD FUCKING DAMMIT I AM SICK OF HEARING ALL THE COMPLAINING I LITERALLY GOT MY INTERNSHIP BY TELLING THE INTERVIEWER ABOUT HOW I USED TO WORK THREE SHITTY JOBS WHILE GOING TO SCHOOL
