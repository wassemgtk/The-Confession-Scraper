Global warming is a hoax. We have the second coldest year on record and we have been cooling down over the years and overdue for another ice age. If it weren't for global warming we would be in another ice age unable to survive and grow crops to feed a healthy world. The industry peddling the lie of global warming or climate change is loosing though because Al Goreleone's movie was a flop and no believes these liberal politicians. Don't worry take all the hot showers you want we have lots of natural gas. Oh and by the way the water molecules are far more potent than your so called carbon dioxide yet no one complains about water vapor causing global warming.
