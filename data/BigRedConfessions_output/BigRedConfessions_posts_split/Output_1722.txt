All I've been doing this semester is work, and I haven't been keeping in touch with my old friends at all. Honestly though, none of them have noticed because they all have busy lives as well. It hurts that I've basically lost my friends, since whenever they go out and do something on the weekends, I'm always busy with something that can't be put off anymore. I feel so alone in this enormous world.
