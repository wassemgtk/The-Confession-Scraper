I think I've developed a crush on a student who's been in both classes I've been a TA for (current and last semester). We've only had indirect contact (like email/FB/etc), but it's been equal parts socializing and course related stuff. I'm not sure if she's interested in me or not but I kind of hope that she would recognize the (very) subtle hints I've given that show I'm interested. I thought I got past the point of developing a crush. =(

Thanks for giving me a place to express this though, it's very helpful. =)
