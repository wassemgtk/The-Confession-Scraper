When I'm feeling super stressed out (which is often), I like to go to the Cornell Store to just sit around, listen to the music (especially when they play classic rock!), and occasionally enjoy a chicken milano. Which reminds me, it has been a full week since I've gotten a chicken milano and I should get one soon....
