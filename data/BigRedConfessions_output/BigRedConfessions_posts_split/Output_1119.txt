My grandfather went to Cornell and met my grandmother, and he told me stories of how he used to travel by train from Ithaca to Buffalo to see Niagara Falls or to Binghamton to relax with her on either the Lehigh or the Erie trains coming into town. Today the stations are abandoned (one was transformed into a bank & the other is a Greyhound stop as my grandfather showed me on a personalized tour of Ithaca & Cornell) and I wish I could be like him. :/ Life must have been great when the Route of the Black Diamond or the Erie trains were traveling through Ithaca. Today we only have freight trains and I only hear the whistle twice a day. I wish we could have trains whistling all the time in Ithaca so that I could travel more and relax. Anyone at Cornell interested in trains? I wish we could form a club maybe with the transportation engineers and talk about train travel. Another great thing about train travel is it is long and forces you to talk to people who you would never talk to unlike the short travels we have today on buses where people text or look down on their phone and develop no social skills when they have their hands on their damn phones all the time. So many opportunities are missed and you could get a better view of the world around you if you just look up rather than looking down all the time on your phone or on the sidewalk. I see this phenomenon all the time on campus and on the buses. I don't understand why people are so afraid of each other not to look at one another.
