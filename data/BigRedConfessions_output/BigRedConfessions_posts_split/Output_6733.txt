"I see these prefrosh asking about how hard Cornell is, if they'll be able to survive academically, and, as a freshman, I want to tell them my honest opinion. More specifically, I want to let them know that Cornell will be the hardest thing they've ever done. I want to let the kids coming from my background especially know that, no, Cornell may not be worth it. If you're poor, struggle with your home life and look to college in general as an escape from dire living situations, no, Cornell isn't the place for you, imo.
I want to warn them because no one warned me. 
It's not just the grade deflation, it's the egos, the winter, the asshole advisors, and, if you're in the sciences, the profs who care more about research and their resumes than they do about undergrads. It's your friends who look down their noses at your either for your socioeconomic status, your low number of credits, or your grades. It's overachieving humble braggers who never shut up. 
And yea, folks may respond to this confession with, ""Well, not everyone has a shitty time here..."" 
And that's fine. But, on the other hand, not everyone loves Cornell to death either. I guess, overall, I don't want some poor kid making the same mistake I did. I don't want someone to be stuck like me and have to spend four years at a school they don't fit in at trying to fix it because they can't transfer with a shitty GPA. 
I want these kids to know that Cornell isn't just *college.* It is, to me, a back-breaking place that certain people (like myself) just can't handle. I don't care how smart you were in hs, how many As you got, how high your test scores were, how much of a nerd you were, you *will* work your ass off here (unless you're a genius). If you're ready for that, go ahead, attend. 
If not, find another school. Don't force yourself to go here because of prestige, or because it's the only Ivy you got into, or because your friends are going, or whatever. Make sure Cornell *fits* you. This decision is a pretty big one. Don't rush it. "
