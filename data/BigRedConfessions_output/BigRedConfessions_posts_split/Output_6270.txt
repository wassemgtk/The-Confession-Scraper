Housing on campus is so stilted in favor of West Campus it's ridiculous. Not only do they get such close placement to campus, but also all those dining halls and essentially free meals. As one of those people who is stuck in Schuyler by a time slot, I find that system to be ridiculous. There should be a different method than random selection, something based on GPA, the most important number and the fairest way to compare all students. If you want to live in a better place, then you have to work to get that place. 

[The meal plan? Mandatory unlimited meals. That's around 5k a semester. That's far from free to me]
