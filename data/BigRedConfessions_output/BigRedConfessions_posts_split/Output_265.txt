I just want to litigate the hell out of this stupid old lady who keeps fraudulently calling CPS on my parents over my little brother. It's caused them no small amount of heartache and grief that they have to keep taking time out of their busy schedules and what precious time they have with them to assure the CPS officers that no, they are not starving their little boy. He's normal weight! But at the same time I'm so scared of the court system and going to court, do we even have a case?
