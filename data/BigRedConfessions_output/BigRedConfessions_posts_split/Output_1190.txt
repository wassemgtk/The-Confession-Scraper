I would really like to have a sexual partner. Not because I'm lonely or anything, but because I perform better academically when I'm getting laid regularly - getting my brain doused in oxytocin and what not makes it easier to concentrate. In some ways this wish seems kinda sick - have I lost my last shred if humanity to the pressure here at Cornell?
