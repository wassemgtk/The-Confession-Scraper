ILR staff (and I love them) must think that the Quiet Area in downstairs Catherwood does not apply to them. Every time I come in before opening hours, they spend 15 minutes chatting. I'm usually here this early cause I have a prelim in a couple hours and I really don't need this distraction. Can they please go to the staff lounge and chat over coffee? Please?!?!?!
