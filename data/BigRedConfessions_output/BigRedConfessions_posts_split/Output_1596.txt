I first saw him when I interviewed for the club. Even though he wasn't the president, he was the one that stood out the most to me out of the interviewing officers. Something about the way he talked or acted was just so alluring. In one club meeting, he even remembered one of the ideas I came up with, but I was too scared to speak up about it. We've even ridden on the same bus for six hours. I think in any normal circumstance that it would be easy to just talk to him and try to get to know him. Only the issue is I'm a guy, and I'm not sure if I like guys yet, and I don't even know if he likes guys either. I'm feeling so confused on all of this. I just don't know what is wrong with me sometimes...
