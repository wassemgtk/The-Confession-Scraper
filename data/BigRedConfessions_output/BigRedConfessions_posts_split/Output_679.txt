I think most people at an Ivy League institution believe that they have to be a perfect (most productive, highly achieving, emotionally stable, most likeable) person by the time of graduation.

As someone who just graduated and is exposed to "adults", I can tell you one things: while those efforts one makes in college are useful, everyone must start from 0 when they graduate, as life becomes very different. In fact, I think one can never ever be a perfect person permanently in one's life: one can be the best version of him/herself in one period of one's life, but as life changes, one must also be able to adapt to that change and restart, many times becoming the person one thought one would never become.

The most we can do is to learn to be adaptive and patient during life's biggest obstacles. and if there's one thing that we should all take from our Cornell education is the ability to learn and reflect, not only for professional purposes, but also for our personal journeys in life. I've observed that many people who always strive for perfection often forget to remember that incredible lesson.
