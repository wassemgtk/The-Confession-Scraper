I judge white people...all the time...every time I see them...mostly because I feel them judging me and mostly for the ripples their ancestors left behind and for the ripples they make with their everyday side comments and implicit racism... I judge you especially if you are uneducated about the struggle of everyone who is not white. If you come to class saying that their are downsides of being white...I judge you.
