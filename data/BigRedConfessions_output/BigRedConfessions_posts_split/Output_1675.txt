I was sitting near a group of kids in Becker who were talking about Avatar: the Last Airbender, AKA the greatest show of all time. Something about an allegory between Jesus and Zuko. Sounded interesting, and I wanted to inquire or at least sit a bit closer so I could hear exactly what was being said, but I knew they wouldn't have been receptive to some random stranger. I wish I could have approached them without consequence. Why do people think gregariousness is creepy. Too bad...
