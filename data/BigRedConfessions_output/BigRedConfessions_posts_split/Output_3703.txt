I've always prized sexual compatibility in a relationship and desire it especially for the girl I would end up marrying. That's why whenever I'm about to enter a relationship, I always ask the girl if I can have sex with her before beginning the relationship to see if we're sexually compatible enough to even be in a relationship in the first place. The more sex we have and the more I like it, the more I know she's sexually compatible enough to be in a relationship with. Usually I have a 1-weekend test where I ask the girl if I can have sex with her Friday through Sunday night. If by the end of the weekend I'm happy and satisfied, we begin to date. Unfortunately, ever since I've begun proposing this sexual compatibility litmus test, I've been getting rejected more and more. Two of 8 girls I've asked out in the last semester have slapped me, 5 more said no and left, and the last one had sex with me but then stole money from my wallet and left Monday morning. The fuck!
