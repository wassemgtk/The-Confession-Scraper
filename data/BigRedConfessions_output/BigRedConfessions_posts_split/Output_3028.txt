I fucking hate this place. I don't much care for the people, the place, or anything else in particular. It doesn't really matter anymore because I'm a junior now and have only a year left. I didn't want to transfer earlier because this a pretty good engineering school or whatever. I figured if a suffered through it for 4 years, at least I'll have an engineering degree from one of the best schools in the country. But I've realized that everything is futile. All of it. I mean what's the point of all this? I get a job and I'll be a 21 yr old just making money with no purpose. I'm working hard now to work harder later. I still work hard and do well in school but deep down I know that all this is pointless. Oh well, none of this matters. I'll put a bullet through my head soon enough (maybe when I'm 25 or so). I've pretty much made up mind about this so no one can convince me otherwise.
