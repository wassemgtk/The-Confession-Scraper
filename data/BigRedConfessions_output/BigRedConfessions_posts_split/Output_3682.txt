Thank you for smiling at me everyday and brightening my day. Every time I see you walk by I get this warm fuzzy feeling inside which not even the terrible weather outside can take away. I just hope you give me the chance to know you better and spend some time with you. In just a few more months we will be walking away in our separate lives like we never met. Don't waste any more time. If you are actually even a little interested, reciprocate a little bit. I know what I am doing and what I want. I won't tell if you won't.
