Do you think I can get her back? Her friends hate me and never trusted me all along. They are a big reason why it ended in the first place. I was afraid of commitment. I thought I wanted to be single in college. I was so wrong. I am determined to marry this girl one day. I just hope she can forgive me. All is fair in love and war though, right?
