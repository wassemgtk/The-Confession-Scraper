After a very, very long time, I have feelings for this really nice guy. But it was doomed to start with because he was with someone else. And then, I drunk dialled him this weekend. From a text everyday, he hasn't spoken to me in three days now. In a way, I am happy because perhaps this is a divine order telling me not to go down that road. But in a way I am crushed, because I thought I finally, after four years, found something that made me feel hopeful! :-(
