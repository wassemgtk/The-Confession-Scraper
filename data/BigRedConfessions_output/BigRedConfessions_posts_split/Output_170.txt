"Fellow Students and Friends at Cornell.

I have suffered many week long constipation cycles at Cornell. And I have the solution if you are one of those few who suffer from chronic constipation. But this isn't advice just for those people; it's advice for everyone. EAT FIBER. Don't just stuff yourself with carbs and meats and those tasty entries at the dining halls and restaurants, get some fresh fruit and vegetables!

Your body will thank you, and most important of all you will thank yourself 30 years down the line.

LET'S ALL BE HEALTHY CORNELLIANS!"
