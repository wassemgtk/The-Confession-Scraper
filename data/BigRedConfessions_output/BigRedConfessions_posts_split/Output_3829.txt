Yet another relationship ended because of my atheism. It's amazing, religious people always complain about being oppressed, but atheists are the most distrusted people in the country. I've been on several dates now that underwent a 180 when the girl found out I didn't believe in God, and I've had a couple of relationships where that was a minor issue at first that ultimately led to our parting ways. And I really really liked the girls, but people just can't tolerate their most fundamental beliefs about existence being questioned. And I don't blame them. But I took astrophysics and I have a brain predisposed to skeptical inquiry and the scientific method and I just cannot believe in supernatural things. I wish I could. Because I really like you. And I can be respectful of religious beliefs, but I can never hold them. They are just completely irreconcilable with who I am. It's stupid that this is a taboo subject. Relationships and nations are ruined because of it.
