"I cannot understand how cat-calling is harassment. If a gay man were do the same to me, I'd be really flattered that he found me attractive. 

It's not something I'd ever do, but do you really think men are maliciously trying to harass you and establish the patriarchy by throwing a wolf-whistle your way? More likely they just want to make it known that they like you physically.

 It's great that you've spread the word about cat-calling to the Cornell community, where I've never once seen it happen. But sooner or later you're going to live in a great big city, and some bored, lonely construction worker will throw a suggestive cheer your way. And no tumblr posts, emotional breakdowns, or strategically placed posters can stop that. "

[So you're saying that because other people will keep cat-calling, that women should just suck it up? Eff that noise, man. Unwanted compliments, touching, forced conversation, or invasions of privacy all fall under the umbrella of harassment, bruh. The fact that guys like you think it's okay for other random guys to assert their sexual interest in random women further proves the point. Guys don't have the right to force themselves onto anyone, anytime, or for any reason. Cat-calling has objectification dynamics]
