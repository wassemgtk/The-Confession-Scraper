I'm so tired of meeting the right people at the wrong time. Is the universe so against me being happy? It's sad to think of the number of people that find each other, only to realize that time and distance stand in their way of building a relationship. I'm grateful that Cornell introduced me to these wonderful people, but I can't help being pained by the number of goodbyes I'm forced to say before graduation. I know this is not the end, but it sure feels like it when you will be 10,000 miles away from everybody in 3 months.
