I was really mad at you because you led me on, and I felt like you saw me as a total joke.  It took me a long time to forgive you, despite your attempts to be friendly again, and I continued to push you away because I still liked you and couldn't deal with just being friends.  But I realize now that I can't keep blaming you, or anyone, for being imperfect, making mistakes, and not being so great at dealing with other people.  I really want to be friends now, but it does appear that my pushing took its effect, and that you no longer want to be friends.  I really regret how I treated you.  I just want to go back to normal.  Please?
