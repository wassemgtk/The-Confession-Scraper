I always see this tall asian guy with sexy big arms working out at Appel or Helen Newman. I just want to go up to him one day and strike up a conversation but I always end up admiring from afar, since I stay on the treadmill and he's always by the weights. The only other thing stopping me is that every so often, I see him work out with this other guy who sort of reminds me of Mr. Bean. Normally, I wouldn't think anything of two guys working out together but the chemistry and sexual tension between them is so obvious that they're clearly in love. F*ck me. Seriously though, I would be in for a threesome.
