My boyfriend comes from a solid Republican family and I am working for Bernie Sanders campaign at Cornell (Democrat Party). He tells me that he wants to register as a Democrat but he is worried that his family and coworkers will disapprove - it's been more than 2 years and he has graduated already. I wonder if he is lying to me
