"For the first time since I was 8, I've gone without masturbating for more than 2 days. My average since age 8 is probably around 1.5 times a day. And 8 is a bit of an arbitrary marker, I honestly don't remember when I started -- I believe it was before 8. Some of my first memories ever were rubbing my penis on the couch, bed, etc. and I had no idea what I was doing or why I was doing it, but I remember hiding because I knew I wasn't supposed to be caught, and I remember associating it with girls somehow, but not at all clear on how or why -- this was way before I even knew about kissing -- and I remember the feeling of orgasm, which felt like this great tingling sensation going up to my anus, but of course nothing came out. I also always took off my pants when I did it... I honestly think I was 6-7.

But I digress. It's the first time I've managed to stop, and it took a LOT of willpower to do it. I am on day 5 and my testicles are really swollen and hurt, my entire worldview and thinking has completely changed. I have more confidence and less anxiety and I cannot stop thinking about sex for the life of me. The spectrum of what I consider attractive has expanded greatly. Nearly every female I run into on campus I find very attractive and regret not trying to talk to. It's a challenge to think about anything else, so staying focused in class has been difficult. Not staring is also a challenge, but I am doing an okay job with that for now.

Not sure if this is some initial period I am supposed to power through, but I am determined to go at least a week, and then maybe do it once and go for another week or more.  My balls are really swollen and hurt a lot, and the pain is going up to my stomach. So if that gets unbearable, I'll end this first streak.

But wow, it's been odd and difficult, and also a crazy adventure of self-discovery. The effects reach far beyond your reproductive system it's amazing. One thing that's happened is I've started to have vivid dreams every night. Not sexual dreams, just regular dreams, but very intense. I never used to have dreams ever. I've also become less jaded, and more aware and appreciative of things in general. And lastly, boy do I have more time. I never realized how much time I spent watching porn and jerking off before. I easily have an additional 90 mins to 2 hours a day now into my schedule. Try it guys, unless you have rape tendencies, then don't because you may not be able to deal with the side effects..."
