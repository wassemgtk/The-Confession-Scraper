I've never had patience for freshman asking for easy classes or easy professors or asking for how to get straight A's or whatever. I didn't have patience for it even as a freshman. You're not in Kansas anymore, kids -- you're not here to make grades, you're here to learn, and I know they said that in high school but this time it's actually true. If you got here by being lazy and always choosing the easiest route through life, then you'd either better transfer out or make a big change in attitude right now because you WILL be challenged here and you'd better figure out how to deal with that. Take classes that you want to take and figure out what you want to learn because if you're doing what you like it won't matter if it's hard, and as long as you learned something it's not going to matter what grade you got in the end. If you can't do that, at least get out of the hair of those of us who actually care because frankly, you're a drag.
