To the guy who is always rapping to himself as he walks home:

One time you were walking by my house at night while I was walking my dogs. You were rapping to yourself, but when you saw me you stopped and seemed embarrassed. Once you got further away from me I heard you start rapping again.

Two things:
1) don't stop rapping. I think it's cute. 
2) In the wise words of Nicki Minaj, boy you got my heart beat running away. Beating like a drum and it's coming your way. Can't you hear that boom badoom boom boom badoom boom base?
