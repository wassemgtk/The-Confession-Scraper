"It's strange. It's as though I can feel myself slipping away.

My mind gets easily caught in patterns, patterns of their own design that spiral downward and into themselves. I've become easier to anger. No, more than that, I've started to look for reasons to lash out. For that, I am sorry to the people around me; I am likely being unfair. Moreover, I have been silent. This anonymous confession is the closest I've gotten to asking for help. Yet I don't feel like I can trust our campus counselors; I've heard more than a few bad things. Perhaps I am simply too proud, or worse yet too ashamed.

Still, there's a cold, dull ache that settles into my chest when I stare out into the night. Slowly but surely, I feel like I'm drifting out into a void. 

I feel so alone. But of course, reading these confessions, I know that I'm not. Plenty of people posting here feel cold and alone.

What a funny paradox we are, all of us who are so cold and alone together."
