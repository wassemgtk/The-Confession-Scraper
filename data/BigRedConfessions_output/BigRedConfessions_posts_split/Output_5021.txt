Before I came to Cornell, I viewed a university - perhaps higher education - as a respite. I was driven by passion for knowledge. In high school, I greatly enjoyed Socratic seminars; to me, sharing ideas with others, and having others share their own, is grandiose. I fondly think of those days where we passionately debated existentialism, The Death of a Salesman, and other works in AP Literature. I yearned for similar experiences in college.

Yet, Cornell does not nurture this culture. There is no honest drive for knowledge, for enjoyment and refinement of abstraction for its own sake. What was the last time you discussed Nietzsche, Sartre, Kierkegaard, Freud with your friends at a social gathering? I am betting that 80% of people that are reading this line at the moment are laughing at the utter 'absurdity' of such a statement - that is if they even have any vague notion of who those men are. No shock the American education system has not produced anyone even slightly reminiscent of these great European minds - and how could it? After all, we are driven by a pursuit of money, cheap sex, Keystone, more liquor. Ask anybody what their goal after college is - I dare you. I am almost positive that 90% of the time it will be something along the lines of "getting out and making tons of money". How noble!

This lack of culture is absurd. Pervasive and detrimental it manifests itself in the feeling of hollowness abundant on campus. But we are cowards - we don't want to admit it and face it - so we pick a delusion over reality, drowning in pools of liquor (Lamar anyone?), weed every night. But it's all just a part of college experience, isn't it? Sure, to each his own. I am just tired of it all. Tired of meaninglessness. Tired of people that somehow got "dumbed down" upon coming here. Tired of living this silly little life surrounded by people who don't want to hear it, don't understand, and, I am afraid, cannot understand.
