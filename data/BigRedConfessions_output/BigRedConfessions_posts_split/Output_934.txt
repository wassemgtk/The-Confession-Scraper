I'm always the other woman. And I always find out after it's too late, after I'm invested. None of them broke my heart because I was never so invested that I was in love but after a string of these awful relationships that I unknowingly get myself into, I hurt. I just hurt and I feel worthless. And as awful as this is for me to say, when I find out and confront the guy, I want him to pick me; to leave his beautiful girlfriend and pick me instead even though I'm just the convenient fuck. I want him to pick me even though I know that I deserve better than someone who sleeps around even though he has a girlfriend. Why is it so hard to find a guy that wants me and only me, one who will choose me? I just want to be someone's first choice.
