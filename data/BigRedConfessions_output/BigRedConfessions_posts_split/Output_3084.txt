I want a friend so badly that the fact I don't have one is killing me. I think the reason I really want a friend because it will be statement for me and everyone else I know, that Im ""want-able"". That I'm not a loser. But until that happens I can only see myself as unwant-able. I wish I didn't care so much what ppl thought, but I do, and it kills me. 
This effect of lack of friendships is getting worse, because every new start ends the same crappy way - friendless. So I don't see how it could get better. 
It's getting so bad that I serious can't sit down to do work because I don't have friends and therefore am super depressed and can only think about the fact I don't have friends and Im super depressed... 
This is a new ending spiral downhill... (Or as they would say here in ithaca, a never ending snowball downhill...)
