Is it possible to message someone you've never actually spoken to in person on Facebook without seeming creepy? Because I really want to speak to you (and you popped up as "people you might know" on fb) but I never see you in person anymore, so I don't know how...
Sincerely,
The most socially inept girl on the planet
