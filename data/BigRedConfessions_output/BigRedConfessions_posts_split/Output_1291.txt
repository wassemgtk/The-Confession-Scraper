So I'm not really sure how the dating/hook-up scene works here in America. For example, is it socially acceptable to just ask someone out on a date - or are you suppose to hang out as friends first. What's the norms when it comes to dating between school years, is a grad student dating a freshmen considered predatory. What is a typical procedure for finding a partner, how long time are you expected to date before you sleep together.
