"I'm taking some time off from Cornell after completing my freshman year, but I have a problem.
At this point, I don't think I ever want to go back. And I know some people will comment ""don't come back then,"" but it's not that simple. During my freshman year I was unliked,  ugly and I earned a shit GPA. I was just some kid from an impoverished home who didn't belong.  Due to my low GPA I can't just transfer and because of my lack of money (barely able to afford food as it is) my choice of other unis is severely limited. 
I just can't see myself ever fitting in at Cornell or even enjoying it, but I need a degree from Cornell to get out of poverty. I never thought I'd find myself in such a shitty situation. The more I struggle and work to better my living situation, the worse it becomes. Part of the reason for my year off is because I couldn't even afford $25 to complete the financial aid process. 

I feel like human garbage, man. "
