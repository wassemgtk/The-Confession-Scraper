All these people saying Cornell over-reacted and was censoring Fox News really need to re-examine the situation.

1. All outside media news organizations need permission from Cornell's community relations department in order to film and interview on campus. This is not all that surprising. This policy serves to protect Cornell from the kind of stunts Fox News just pulled, and it helps to protect the privacy of students and staff members.

2. Fox News did not obtain permission to film or interview from Cornell's administration. This means that they were in violation of the policy. People argue that Cornell is public land since it obtains money from the state. If that was the case, then there would be no such thing as a private university, since just about every university gets some money from the state. Cornell is a private university, and as such, is well within its rights to have this policy in place and to react accordingly when it is violated.

3. Cornell did not pursue any actual means to censor Fox News. They could have issued a persona non grata. They could have had CUPD escort them off campus and have patrols running to make sure they don't interview anyone. Did they do that? No. They allowed Fox News to continue their "story" off campus without impediment.

4. This policy does not violate the First Amendment. It does not say "Fox News cannot record or interview students on campus." It says that all outside news organizations must obtain permission to record and interview on campus. This is the same ordinance that many townships have about organized protests:  you need to have a permit in order to stage your protest. This policy does not actively engage to limit free speech, nor did Cornell do anything to actively prevent Fox News from conducting their business at all (besides saying they can't do it on campus). This policy may be abused, but by itself, it is not limiting free speech or violating the First Amendment.
