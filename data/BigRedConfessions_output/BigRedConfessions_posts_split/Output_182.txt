"This white student union person is an obvious troll. But the fact that people are getting so mad about it is absurd.

The people spending so much time and energy complaining about white people, and then insult 'our' culture as non existant need to get a grip.

A. Which white culture? English? French? Italian? Russian? Spanish? Greek? I may be white but I have nothing to do with any of those cultures.

B. You're just acting like the troll if you go around putting down 'white' (broad spectrum of people there) culture as nonexistant. 

I'm German so I'll just go with German stuff, Polka, Alpining, Pretzels, Opera (started in Italy, made great in Germany), a vast chunk of the world's knowledge of chemistry and astronomy, helicopters, text messaging, the computer, etc.

So you can complain about this troll being an idiot all you want, but you can piss off if you want to tell me that I don't have a culture."
