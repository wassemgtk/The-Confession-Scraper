I'm already an addict... I've joined a 12 step program for my addiction... However I'm not sober and it tough. 
But my real confession is that it's 3pm and I'm supper depressed and I just want to drink some of my alcohol.... So reading this your thinking I'm an alcoholic. But I not. But I might soon ALSO be an alcoholic...
