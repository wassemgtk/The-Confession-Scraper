I'm in my early 20s and still a virgin.  If I wanted to, I could get a guy and just get it done with, I know I could.  But I don't want to do it like that!  I want to share that moment with someone I really like and who really likes me.  Someone I care about!  Is there something wrong with that?  I don't go around shouting "I'm a virgin," but it comes up in conversations sometimes (very rarely - like with friends or family, sometimes) and I'm made to feel like I'm weird because I'm "so old."
