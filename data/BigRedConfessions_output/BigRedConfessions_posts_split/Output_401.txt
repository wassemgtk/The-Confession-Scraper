I'm really really scared right now. I just checked Blackboard and I got a 42 on my Calc I prelim. The median was a 68 and the mean was a 66. I'm a freshman and I am so scared. I am scared that my life will over. I know it sounds pity and stupid but I have never failed an exam before. On blackboard, it said that 32-42 is D-ish. What do I do? I am so scared that my life is over. I am scared that I can't get a job. I am scared that my parents will be upset. I feel like my life is over.
