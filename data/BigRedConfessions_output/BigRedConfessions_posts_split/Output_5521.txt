Dear "friend" in my major. Talking shit about everyone is not okay.  Eventually we all hear about it, and while it might make you feel better about yourself, all you're doing is hurting everyone else and making them detest you.  I pretend that I don't know, but Ive heard what you've said about me and its not okay.  It really hurts to hear that someone thinks of your work in that way.  I can't wait to get out of hear and leave this shitshow behind for the summer.
