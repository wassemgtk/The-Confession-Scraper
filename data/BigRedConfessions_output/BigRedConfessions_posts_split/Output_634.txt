I have never managed to get higher than a 69 on a prelim at Cornell. I wish I had a friend that could reassure me I'm not a loser because I always think I am a massive loser. I just want to cry and drink away my problems. Alcohol helps me fall asleep after all this stress I have had going to Cornell. I knew I should have never went to this school and should have instead attended a state school back home like the rest of my friends did, and most of them already graduated and have nice jobs.
