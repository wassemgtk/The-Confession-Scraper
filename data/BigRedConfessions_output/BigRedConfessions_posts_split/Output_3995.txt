"My boyfriend never let's me get a word in edgewise. We are always talking about him or discussing his problem or hearing about what goes on at his school or his plans for the future. I have things going on too and I can never tell him. He used to be my best friend and we used to talk ALL the time. I understand that things come up so the quantity of the conversations may be cut short, but the quality has been too. 

He also has a habit of not letting me express an opinion. By that I mean that if something bothers me, and he doesn't think it's logical -- he tells me that I shouldn't feel that way; that I'm wrong. He never apologizes for anything he does. It doesn't matter if it hurts me or not, because if it isn't what he intended he shouldn't have to apologize for something he didn't mean.

I just let go of someone who was suppose to be my best friend here, because she managed to make everything immensely complicated and I didn't need that in my life. She constantly put me second, lied, and genuinely thought that the word sorry fixed everything magically -- instead of actually trying to not do the offending actions. So now, I'm completely alone. All I have is him, and he isn't really there. He would argue that he is, but if that's true why the hell do I feel so shitty inside? I need someone too, you know? "
