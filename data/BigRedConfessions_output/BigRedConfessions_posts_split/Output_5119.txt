I'm about to go into my junior year as a computer science major. However, I barely know anything about programming or computer science. I have a 2.7 and I've barely passed each of my classes. I just got fired from an internship that my dad got for me due to a, "severe lack of experience required for the job." I probably should have switched majors to something I cared about earlier.

Oh yeah, and I have no friends and no girl has ever liked me.

I fucking hate my life.
