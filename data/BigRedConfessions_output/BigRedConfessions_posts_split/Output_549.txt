"I want to live in the area I love, but I cannot.
I want to get a job in I got my degree in, but no one wants to hire me.
I want to be with my ex, but they no longer want to be with me.
I want to do the things that I am passionate about, but I don't have the time.
I want to buy the things that make me happy, but I don't have enough money.

Welcome to the real world indeed.
