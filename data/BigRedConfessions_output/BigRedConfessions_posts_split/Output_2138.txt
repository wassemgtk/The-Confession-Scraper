To the girl who I met at Collegetown Bagels on the morning of your biochem final and previously in the courtyard at Cascadilla, good luck with your biochem final and pre-vet goals! You're also a really great conversationalist. Looking forward to meeting you more often. Sorry for being rather uncommunicative at first.
