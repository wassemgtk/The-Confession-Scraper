You think I have branched out and met more friends...and although its true I thought you might have been my best friend. But the people who hang out with me now know more about me than you ever did and it sucks that I think I can't even tell you without being judged for it. At least my "friends" now accept me for what I've done. I doubt you could even get past it.
