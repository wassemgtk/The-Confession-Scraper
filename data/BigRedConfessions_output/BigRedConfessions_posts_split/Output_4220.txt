To me, snarky comments are the best kind of flirting.  My friends think I'm a little crazy.  That's how I think someone would fit me well; if they can return my goddamn snark.  You'd think that since I'm a girl looking for a snarky guy I wouldn't have this many problems finding them.  Aren't those supposed to be easy to find?  Apparently most people find them annoying......
