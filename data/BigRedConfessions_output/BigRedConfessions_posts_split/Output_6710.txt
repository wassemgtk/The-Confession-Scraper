"To #1218, and everyone else:

First off, I respect your struggle completely. And while we're being honest, I thought I'd shed light on my own, from another side of the coin.

I'm not poor, but surely not at all rolling in money - enough to not receive any financial aid but not enough to escape the hundred thousand dollars of debt (likely more) I will be in when I graduate. I don't just have money to blow, either.
I'm physically unable to enroll in a typical course load, due to mental health problems, as well as a medically-based need for a substantial amount of sleep (that I am often ridiculed for by my peers). Meanwhile, my parents are constantly on my case for not being able to make enough money, both during the school year and over the summer, even though it'd be impossible to handle a third job on top of the two I already run back and forth between. And my GPA has been suffering. (You mentioned an A average? What's that?)

I'm lucky enough to be close enough to actually return to my hometown over some breaks, but the environment there makes me not want to. Tensions rising to the point of a potential second divorce for one parent, the cliche but all too real hatred from a stepparent on the other side, a suffocating pressure to find a job for any break I have (but who even hires someone for two weeks?), and no friends in that town to see, either - friends was a concept I didn't get to experience first-hand until college. There was a job that I could maybe return to, but would get verbally abused at. So I don't return to that town, if I can help it. I spend my summers here, mainly because I can't go anywhere else. And am lucky if I'll ever earn enough to just break even on costs.

If you asked me if I was happy, I wouldn't be sure. Depression is a heartless demon, but on the off chance I get to escape, though rare, I am thankful. My experiences may have been painful, but having had them, I have more respect for others' - regardless of the form your fight may be in. It's a shame so many have wars to wage, but it's amazing we've been able to make it here. So props to you, too, for thriving despite the opposition. It's been inspiring to chase my dreams alongside all of you."
