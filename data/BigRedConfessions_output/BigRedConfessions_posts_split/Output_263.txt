Sometimes when I'm alone in bed I get extremely sad because I feel like nobody cares about me. I'm afraid to tell people about my problems because I fear judgement. My friends probably think I'm always happy, confident, and carefree. In reality I am so scared about my future and self conscious about every aspect of myself. My thoughts are so pessimistic and cynical. But I can't tell anyone anything because I personally wouldn't want to talk to someone like that. Nobody can help me. I tried CAPS, but they didn't offer much help. I revert back into my previous mental state as soon as I leave that place. I don't want to tell my friends. I don't want to tell my boyfriend either, since I feel like if I start depending on him too much, he'll think I'm needy and leave me. So I'm stuck feeling miserable and unable to help myself.
