My mother hates me for not being a good enough student. It's stressed me out since I was a child--her drive for excellence. I think she's internally very angry at herself for not rising to the pinnacle of her conservative Indian patriarchy and for being treated like filth for being too dark by her own cunt of a mother. Seeing what she's been through--all the pain from years of abuse and a forced marriage to an abusive, uneducated and adulterous man--used to motivate me to excel for her sake. Then when things started to get bad earlier in college, I lost all her faith. I never expected to be coddled either in times of success or in times of failure. But her defeatist attitude and her biting insults have destroyed me. I know she looks at me as a failure and that I'll just be a repeat of my dad. I want to help her, but I can't. I hate myself for being so weak, stupid, and depressed.
