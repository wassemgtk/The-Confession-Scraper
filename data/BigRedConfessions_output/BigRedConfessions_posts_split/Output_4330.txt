"So my ex-boyfriend was kind of really shitty, as in mentally and sexually abused me for months kind of really shitty. 
I never could really admit that that was the kind of relationship I had been in up until now, months after the break off. And I only manged to really realize this because of my current boyfriend. Although it was a painful realization, I don't have time to be sad because my boyfriend is so good at making me happy and feel satisfied with everyday life, despite my not-so-great past. 
So I want to thank him, who I know actually loves and respects me, for making me realize what it truly means to be cared for, and what a healthy relationship should look and feel like. 
Thank you, and I love you. I'm so lucky to have you
