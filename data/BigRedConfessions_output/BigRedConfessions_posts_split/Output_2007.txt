I am being told that you most likely still like me to some extent, even if you don't know what to do with that. A part of me agrees, and doesn't even know what to do with that info either. But another part of me doesn't give a fuck either way, because if you you truly cared, you would at least send me a message to ask how I am doing, but you never will, because I will never matter, and that little fact alone keeps me on my straight and narrow.
