Sometimes I play music in my room, close my eyes, and pretend I'm dancing with the love of my life. I don't know him yet but I was raised as a mushy romantic. My dad told me when he asked my mom to dance the first time he saw her, he avoided dating her after that because things would have been too serious. But the day he saw her on a date with another guy he knew that he had to make her his wife, she was the one. Every friday night for as long as I can remember, my dad would cook dinner for us, and they would play music, and we would all dance. My life growing up with my parents has been amazing. And I think it's because of how much they love each other. The way my mom made him laugh and his light heartedness has always been the best feeling to go home to. My parents being multiracial has only made it more amazing because both of them are liberal but have the same morals of what it means to be a good person. My dad said what he loved about my mother the most is that she was his best friend. She had a simpleness to her but a drive and zest for life. Mommy, dad and I miss you very much. As I stand here playing our song, dancing with my pillow, imagining the person I will spend my life with... I think of everything you and dad taught me. I know you're in heaven probably dancing along to this same song. This Thanksgiving, I am grateful for my family.
