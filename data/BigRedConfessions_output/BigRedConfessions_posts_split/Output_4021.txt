Its getting colder, my GPA is dropping despite being regular and working hard, my halloween sucked, i am in this i don’t know conflict with one of my friends who isn’t even trying, i miss home and cornell isn’t the best at keeping people happy. All i want is some sanity. i guess not in my destiny. I just feel too tired to do anything, i cry myself to sleep all the time and my roommate sucks, she’s a little too untidy. ugh.
