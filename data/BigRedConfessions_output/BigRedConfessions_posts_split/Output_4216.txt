There's no apparent problem with my life right now. That means everything should be great, right? I can't explain why I feel like crap. I've been suicidal since I was 12. I've used CAPS/professional help only recently. They've been helpful, but I don't feel like it will make a difference. It's a done deal, and it's only going to be a matter of time. I just don't want to trigger a massive streak of suicides like what had happened back in 2010. I need to disappear subtly.
