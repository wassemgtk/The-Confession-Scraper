When my gf and I cook, I offer to share with my roommate and he always accepts. Now that his gf visited him for a week, he never offered. I know I shouldn't do stuff expecting something in return, but it’s like “do you want some?” would change everything. We do have a good relationship and stuff, but I don’t know how I am feeling about this. Anybody has thoughts?
