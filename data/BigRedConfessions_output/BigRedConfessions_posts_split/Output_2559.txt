I'm tired of people bitching about how to talk or not talk about racism and other forms of discrimination. There's all these people posting extensive manifestos about who should and shouldn't be talking and it get's the actual conversation NOWHERE! There will always be bigots, jerks and assholes out there who disagree or have backwards thinking and they're always going to try to put in their two cents, but that doesn't mean that all white people are like that and therefore shouldn't be in the conversation and just because they have something to say/contribute doesn't mean that they're not listening! What's important is that the conversation happens and we all work together for change.
