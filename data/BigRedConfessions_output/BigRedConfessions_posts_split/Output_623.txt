To all the people that post here about their problems, frustrations, issues, or even depression... I hope when your confessions are posted and people comment stuff like "message me" you DO ACTUALLY message them. Don't be ashamed or embarrassed. If someone's offering you help, they mean well.... life's not easy, we all need help sometimes. So PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE actually message those lovely people that offer to talk to you.
