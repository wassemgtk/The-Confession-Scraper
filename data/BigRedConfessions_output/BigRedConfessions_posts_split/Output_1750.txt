I always thought college was the time to have as much sex as possible because you'll never have that opportunity as much again. I've been here for more than a year and still haven't had sex though. I've made out with a few guys at parties but it never really felt right to go home with them. I really want to have fun and get laid but I'm worried I won't find anyone I'm comfortable enough with to do that with.
