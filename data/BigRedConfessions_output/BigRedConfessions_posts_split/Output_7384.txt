"it's not really exaggerating to say that i live in fear almost every day. i've never feared for someone so much. 

please, no matter how much you can't stand your parents, your loved ones, please please please treasure them and spend as much time as you can with them. build memories and fully exhaust your time together. share as much happiness as you can before terrible things happen. often we don't act or change our ways or start making an effort until it's too late.

i'm so scared and i think my every breath and thought is jinxing everything else, i'm pretty much caught up in a web of paranoia and fear. i kind of know that if the worst happens, i'll have no choice but to go on like that. but somehow i really really can't accept it. it must be horrible to be a doctor, losing a patient would completely wreck me.

frankly i don't know how i would graduate if this were to happen, i just wouldn't be able to handle it for the longest time. please be strong, please win. i'm not much help but i'll root for you until it goes away. i'll work hard, i promise. will you be okay if i work my hardest? will it go away if i be a good girl and try my best? i'm sorry i didn't see it earlier and i'm sorry i didn't spend more time with you. i miss you already, dad. i'm scared."
