Today I didn't submit my problem set. I didn't submit it last week either. Nor did I submit a problem set for a different class that was due on Friday. That's a total of 3 problem sets that I just didn't submit because honestly? It's getting to the point where I have no motivation for ANYTHING. Everyone's like "just do your work, it's okay" but  it's not okay. I'm not getting my work done, I never have motivation. My personal life is a mess because for some reason I've become a boy magnet and it's flattering but so depressing too because I feel nothing. I want a boyfriend but I feel nothing towards any boy (or girl in case you start suggesting maybe I'm a lesbian). I want to do my homework but I literally am so unmotivated that when I try I fall asleep on top of it, no matter what time of day it is and how much sleep I got the day before. College was supposed to be fun, instead it feels like torture. I'm drowning and I don't even know what to do about that.
