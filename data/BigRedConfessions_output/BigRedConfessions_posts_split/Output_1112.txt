I'm really nervous about finding a junior-year internship for the summer. While my grades and extra curricular are fine, I'm afraid that I'm too boring and unconfident to land a job in consulting (something I'm honestly interested in). I don't know how to network or how to ace those interviews. 

I'm too awkward with new people. Maybe I'm not cut out for a job in this field. I hate to think that I have to give up on something I care about because I don't fit in easily.
