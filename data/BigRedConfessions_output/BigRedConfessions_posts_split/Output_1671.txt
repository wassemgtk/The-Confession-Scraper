Yea, that was me. You seemed angry, afraid, annoyed, disgusted, or maybe you didn't notice/recognize me at all. Sorry for that confession. Whether you believe it or not, a different person posted that, not me. As in, a different, stupider version of myself. So yea, even though I don't think about you or that post AT ALL anymore, I can imagine how you might have felt seeing me in the flesh. Especially on the small steps leading to West, in such an intimate space, without enough time for either of us to pretend like we don't see the other (me to spare you the stress and you out of an understandable aversion towards me). Anyway, you don't have to forgive me. I'll be alright, and I'm sure you'll be able to forget about me easily in time. Hoping it happens sooner rather than later, for your sake not mine.
