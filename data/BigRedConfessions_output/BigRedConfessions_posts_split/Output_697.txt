I feel like there's a huge amount of frustration, unhappiness and resulting lost productivity from people being sexually frustrated because they can't find anyone to date, be in a relationship, or just have sex with. A NYT article I just read said 45% of people in their 20s have not had sex in the past year. I think social media, and everything happening online nowadays have made the issue a lot worse. And so have computers in general -- people spend half their lives in front of monitors, that's highly unnatural and depressing.

And the social contract is pretty strict on talking to strangers, save for just the right circumstances/environment. Even at networking events and other places where you're expected to mingle, people stick in their groups and don't really talk to strangers, let alone try to start a romantic thing. You can go to bars and clubs, but that's not really how a lot of people want to meet, and despite having the reputation for being places to pick up strangers, it's basically just as hard. The internet has capitalized on this (ironically since it contributed enormously to the problem) with dating apps and sites, but I personally have a psychological block and don't take people I "meet" on those apps, like Tinder, to be "real" people. It's almost like playing a video game. It's not organic, it's not normal and the "stranger on the internet" image basically makes it very hard to commit and take it seriously.

I'm not proposing a solution, I just think it's sad that there are millions upon millions of lonely and/or horny people who see each other outside all the time, and like each other, but can't do anything about it. I've had multiple instances where I felt someone liked me, and I liked them too, but we just didn't have the right excuse to start a conversation. That leads to frustration because that's not how we evolved. I'm not suggesting we go back to how we evolved, because that's essentially rape, but I feel like the species does best when we can emulate, within reasonable ethical boundaries, the processes that helped us evolve. This is why capitalism works and communism does't -- people are competitive and greedy by nature. I think we need to figure out a way to apply the same principle to meeting people of the opposite sex."
