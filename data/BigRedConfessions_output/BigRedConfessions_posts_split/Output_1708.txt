It's so easy to feel bad about oneself, especially here in a place where so many people seem to be excelling in all aspects of their lives.  Don't compare and stop caring about what others think.  No matter what you are doing, IT MATTERS.  You don't have to be helping source clean water in Africa or designing a revolutionary, new power system to live a meaningful life.  As long as you do your best at whatever it is you do, that is what's truly important.
