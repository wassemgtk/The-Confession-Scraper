I cut you off from my life because I had an unhealthy attraction to you. I told you that I loved you and I still do, but I knew you wanted to be friends and I knew I couldn't provide that support that I wanted to be for you while keeping my feelings in check -- leading to those crazy outbursts. I said that we shouldn't talk, and while this is difficult just know that I need it to be able to get away from you. I hate the fact that I put stress on you, meaning that I needed to change. Maybe one day we can be friends again, maybe not -- just know that you're awesome and a cool kat (with a k).
