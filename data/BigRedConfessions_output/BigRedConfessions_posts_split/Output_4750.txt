I want to take more classes than I can handle. It's like shopping at a mall with unlimited cash but having a small car to carry all the stuff. I pre-enrolled in 25 credits and there is no way I'll have social life (or mental sanity) by doing all this. I'll reduce to 16 which is healthier. Drop drop drop. Yep, we also learn how to prioritize and make decisions at Cornell.
