When I hear people talk about Greek life, I honestly want to throw up.  It's disgusting how obsessed people are with a silly club they pay thousands of dollars to be a part of.  You're only a "family" because you were superficially judged to be "good enough" to fit in with that particular group of people.  How shallow can you get?
