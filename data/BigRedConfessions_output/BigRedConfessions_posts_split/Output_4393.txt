Cornell is supposed to be very LGBT friendly, and that's not wrong. Everyone I've met who finds out I'm gay has been perfectly fine with it. My question is, why is it SO hard to find other gay guys?! I feel like there are almost none, or I'm looking in the wrong places. The only way to find other gay guys here is by using Tinder or some other equally desperate "dating service", but where does that leave a guy who actually wants a relationship and not a one-nighter? I'd love to be able to find people without waving around a rainbow banner over my head 24/7 to let other gay guys know I exist. In all seriousness though, I'm getting really desperate...
