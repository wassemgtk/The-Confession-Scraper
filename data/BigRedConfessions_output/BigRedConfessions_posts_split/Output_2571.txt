I feel like the NSA is listening to all my phone conversations and everytime I walk past a camera they are spying on me and even perhaps through my webcam without me knowing it. I wouldn't be surprised if there were many agents listening to my calls and spying on me, and I would get offended if there was only one because I mean I have a home phone and a cell phone. They need to know that I order pizza from one and talk to my family on the other one. I feel so watched. I don't know what to do.
