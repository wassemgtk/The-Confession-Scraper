I know this is old, cliched, hippie, etc. or whatever, but it doesn't make it untrue. I really think it's absolutely abhorrent that we commit the equivalent of by far the largest genocide in history every day on innocent animals. At that, quite evolved mammals. Pigs are actually one of the most intelligent species in the world, up there with dogs. They have emotions, they reason, they have self-awareness. I am a complete hypocrite because I eat meat, and the reason we do it is because the vast majority of humans do as well. If we didn't though, and hadn't all grown up accepting it - think about how disgusting we would find the thought of it. You can go to jail for animal molestation, yet killing millions every day is okay. It's just a bit ridiculous is all, in the most terrible sense. On top of it all, nowadays animals are tortured, forced to live in their own waste, chained their whole lives in minimal space and shot up with insane drugs. I'm not a hippie, I'm actually quite a moderate Democrat, on a lot of issues conservative, but this is outside of political views. People used to think that slavery was acceptable, not because they thought it was okay to treat people inhumanely, but because they unconditionally believed that free labor was indispensable to their way of life. I think the mass killing of animals is an analogous situation. Not anything like it, not comparable, but analogous in how it's justified. I hate the fact we have to do it.
