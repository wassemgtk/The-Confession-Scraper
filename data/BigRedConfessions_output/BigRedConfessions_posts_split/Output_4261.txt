"This guy and I have been on-and-off friends for a couple years now and when he told me he liked me, I didn't know how to act. A couple weeks ago, he just stopped talking to me and has been avoiding me (which is pretty easy to do in this big campus). Now, another guy has started talking to me like he did and I'm suddenly so afraid. What if he likes me and I break his heart too?
