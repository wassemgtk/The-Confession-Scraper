Take the time before you leave this semester (or before everyone else leaves) to tell your friends and family that you love them. Tell them how much they mean to you, it can make a big difference in both of your lives.
This semester has been an emotional roller coaster for me; my best friend from back home was in a near fatal accident and spent a week in critical condition at the hospital (while I sat helplessly here), my sister was diagnosed with a life threatening disorder, I've spent more time sick and bed-ridden than not, and I've struggled to stay up in my classes because of it, at a time where my GPA and job prospects are slipping away from me. But through all that, I was able to meet a girl who I love more than anything else in the world right now. She has changed the way I look at myself and my other relationships. I realized that no matter what shit I was going through, I needed to take the time to put everything in perspective. I now take the time once a week or so to tell her a small thing about how much she means to me - making myself feel better in the process, and inspiring me to be the person that she is for me, for my other friends and loved ones.
I know how hard it is sometimes to be positive here at Cornell, with academics, the weather, social isolation, or whatever else. I don't have many friends either. And I fucking hate the winter. But it's better for you in the long run to put in that work to be positive, and to be a positive influence on others. So tell your friends and family how much you care about them; you might be surprised how much they truly care about you, too.
