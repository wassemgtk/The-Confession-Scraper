All the "nice guy" posts get mocked into oblivion here, oft cause the authors are twats. But I have a few guy friends who I just consider to be incredibly nice and respectful and well meaning and blah blah blah blah blah. And I have a decent number more guy friends who are ... less so. And the nice guys really do finish last. It's a shitty fact.
