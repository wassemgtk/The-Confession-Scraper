I feel like I'm not pretty enough to rush. I'm not so ugly, I get guys and sex but that's not the point. I hate being in pictures. I'm not super peppy, I'm not a fan of hugging or being all sisterly. I would feel so awkward seeing all these smiley people, even on bid day, having to be super huggy and happy. Though I of course appreciate the sisterhood, and that's part of why I want to rush. I barely have friends and had a bad first semester. I want to meet more people, friends and people to go out with. I don't really go out as much as I'd like, so I think a sorority would be good for that. But at the same time, I don't want to have to suck up to everyone I see for a week. I'm not a huge partier, but I drink some and like chill gatherings. I'm just not a sorority type girl, so I'm afraid I really won't like it. Any advice would be appreciated.
