This university needs to do something drastic about housing. I'm a freshman and I already have friends signing ridiculously priced 12-month leases for shitty houses in college town. The "guaranteed" housing here is an absolute joke. My understanding is, IF you're lucky enough to be one of the 300 non transfers who get to live in the nice buildings on west, you stay there for your junior and even senior years and it makes it even harder for underclassmen to find places to live.  
I have no desire to join greek life, so that isn't a housing option for me. Cornell is stressful enough without me having to worry about how I'm going to ask my parents to pay 12 months for a condemnable house in college town.
