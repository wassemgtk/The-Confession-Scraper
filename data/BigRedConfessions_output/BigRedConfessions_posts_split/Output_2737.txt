Dear the female engineer from #5309,

I know what you feel. I've only been in Cornell this year and I hate this place so much. I feel so shameful whenever I think of what I have accomplished this year and how much money my parents spent on my education. I went to a small liberal arts college before attending here and I was so much happier there. If it were not because my parents insisted, I'd never go to Cornell in the first place. Anyhow, I only have 1 year left from graduating with a degree from an Ivy League school, so even if I fail my classes, even if I have no motivation when I get up in the morning, and even if I have suicidal thoughts, I know I will be fine at the end. Soon enough, this experience will become the past. 
Girl, I know this is tough, but you are more than what people think you should be/do. Take a break, enjoy yourself, and know that we'll be fine at the end.

Best wishes,
A female junior
