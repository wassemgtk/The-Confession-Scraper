"My first five semesters at Cornell were the most miserable two and a half years of my life. I was lonely, anxious and depressed. I went through weeks of staying in my room watching shows I didn't even want to watch. 

I went to parties and didn't talk to anyone because I was scared to.

I ate a lot with people I didn't like, just to feel less lonely.

I lost confidence in my academic and social abilities. I felt like this place had ripped me apart.

And then I started being honest. First with myself. Then with other people. I found out when I was completely honest with people they would reciprocate with honesty. I stopped worrying whether or not people liked being around me. I started to ask myself who I liked being around. For the first time in my life I made real connections with other people. People who I genuinely enjoyed being around.

I realized that I didn't have to be the funny guy or the loud guy or the guythat'sfriendswitheveryone guy. I just had to be me.

And I'm happy.

So many people have a hard time creating functional relationships. Even the people who seem to be always surrounded by people. For those still struggling, know that you are not alone. Far from it.

I think it's about opening up. Being completely honest about your needs. Learning that everyone actually has the same necessities in life.

It's kind of difficult. 

But you can do it."
