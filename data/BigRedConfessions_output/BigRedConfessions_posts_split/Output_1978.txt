I really like this guy, and maybe want to spend my life with him, but I'm just so worried about our futures. I mean, he's going to grad school, and me the year after. We're in different fields so we probably won't be going to the same grad school. And even if we make it through that, the odds that we'll get jobs at universities close to each other (because let's not pretend we'll get a spousal hire fresh out of grad school) are super low. I love you, but I don't want to be the thing that holds you back, and you've said you don't want to hold me back. I love you, but what if the best thing for both of us is to let it go? I just wish the two body problem was easier to solve...
