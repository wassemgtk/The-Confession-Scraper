I know that when you insult me in front of everyone you're just trying to impress the group, but I'm still insulted. I'm insulted that you think you can embarrass me, belittle me, and degrade me in public, then come crawling back for emotional support, encouragement, help, and guidance when we're one on one. I'm insulted that you take me for granted, that you have come to expect my unconditional generosity and understanding, but most of all I'm insulted by myself for allowing this "friend"ship to continue. No matter how livid you make me, I always seem to forgive your rude, hurtful, behavior. Lucky you.
