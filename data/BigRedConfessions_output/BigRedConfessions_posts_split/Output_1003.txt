For me, Cornell isn't that academically difficult, but the thing that ruins this school is the people. The majority of people here that I am around really do not know how to deal with a friend who is depressed. Giving somebody the option of just leaving a group of friends they have spent month in is not helpful at all, it just makes a person feel hopeless. I understand that not all people are made to be friends, but is it that hard to be a kind and respectful person? It seems like the only times my so-called friends care that I exist is when they think I am going to hurt myself. Other than that I feel like I don't exist.
