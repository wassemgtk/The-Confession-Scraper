I'm learning/learned the hard way that love is not a game. Real relationships are not rooted in manipulation. I can't try and change your mind to make you want me back and I can't blame myself for not being what you want. I can't walk by you looking decent and make you realize that you should try again. I can't remind you of the girl I was when you first liked me because that girl was mostly an illusion of your mind. Nothing's going to change your mind if your mind has already been made up. You don't want me. Fine. There's nothing wrong with me because you don't. I'm not lacking anything. If I feel the need to change, it'll be on my own terms. In the mean time, I have to resist the urge to contact you because it'll be like chasing a dead horse and only hurt me. I have to recognize when situations are bad for me. I have to love myself.
