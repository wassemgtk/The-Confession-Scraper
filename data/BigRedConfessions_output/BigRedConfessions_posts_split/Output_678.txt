Median grades on our transcript is the worst thing cornell can do to us for graduate school, medical school, law school, etc. If the class has a high average  then that makes us look bad if we get a bad grade (or even a good grade). If the class has a low average, the graduate schools will realize it is a hard class, but still take the person from Harvard with straight A's and a higher GPA. Every other ivy league doesn't do this to their students, but Cornell is determined to try to prove how hard the classes are to everyone else. It might help Cornell's reputation, but it hurts the students.
