Ever since I was young I've always been perceptive to how people felt just by interacting with them. I noticed that I could tell what kind of day a person had been having without even having them say anything. With this skill I try to interact with people to gear the conversation to them feeling better, but lately, I've felt like I've been neglecting my own well-being this whole time. I've been focusing so much on others that I haven't been able to notice how soul-crushingly depressed I am. I want to explode and see all that comes out.
