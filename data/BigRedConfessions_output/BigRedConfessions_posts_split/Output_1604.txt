Last winter, I noticed how many kids on campus were wearing Canada Goose down coats. Apparently, these jackets are ethically manufactured, which is another point in their favor, along with their popularity and cuteness. So I visited the website today, thinking that I will get one this winter. The cheapest coat is $500. This just put into perspective, how rich Cornell kids are! Sigh!
