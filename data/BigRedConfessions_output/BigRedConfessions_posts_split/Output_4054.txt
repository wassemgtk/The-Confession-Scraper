"When making one of my many Starbucks runs, I noticed that the girl working the cashier was really cute.  I didn't make any bold moves.  She was just there to do her job, and I'm not one to go out on a limb like that.  I just smiled, made eye contact, and tried to be as friendly as I could be (without seeming creepy of course).  But for a split second it seemed like the friendliness that she was giving back was more than what she had to for positive customer relations. After I ordered, I looked back, and she had this really cute smile on her face that for the slightest of moments made it seem that she might be interested in me.  Instead of capitalizing on the situation, a pang of surprise and panic struck through me, and I walked away from the cashier even faster...

  Wtf is wrong with me?  oh well, there's always next time... "
