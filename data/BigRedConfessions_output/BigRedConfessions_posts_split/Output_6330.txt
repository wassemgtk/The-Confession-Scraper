To post 1600: I was raped not once, but three times during my four years at Cornell. You may have had a shitty experience, but I never spoke up after any of my experiences because I was terrified. And I'm sorry you were wrongly accused. But I know of my own experiences, as well as the experiences of many friends of mine, and I know that the Cornell environment is not conducive to people coming forward and letting people know when crimes have been committed.
