My friends this year are really mean to me. Like I can laugh and smile and I know I do some ridiculous things. I pretend it doesn't bother me, but it really does-especially in front of other people. You degrading me in that way allows other people to do the same. So, everyone at Cornell, please be mindful of what you say to those around you. They may just be embarrassed to tell you how they feel.
