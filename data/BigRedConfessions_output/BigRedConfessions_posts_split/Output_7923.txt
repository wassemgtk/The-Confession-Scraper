I can't express how much I respect and admire you, but I feel that you've left your friends behind. You've turned hostile, and when I try to help you lock me out. True, there was a time I thought we could be more than friends and I know you knew, but that doesn't mean I still can't be there for you, as a friend. I care about you a lot, and I don't know why, but please don't keep laughing me away when I try to help.
