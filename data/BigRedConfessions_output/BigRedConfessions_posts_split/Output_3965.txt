I hate to say this but last night I became a stalker. There's this person who lives below me on west that always plays really good music. I decided last night to go downstairs and find this mystery person. Saw a name on the door with a curious spelling and went to the cornell people finder page to find the person's last name. When I got their full name, I facebooked them. I was completely shocked to see how beautiful she is. Why have I never seen you? Is it possible to fall in love with someone just based on their music preferences? Because I am confident that is what happened. I have never in my life done something that stalkerie. I feel so guilty right now...
