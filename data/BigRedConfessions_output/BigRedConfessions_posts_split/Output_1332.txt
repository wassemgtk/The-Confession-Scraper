My wife and I graduated from Cornell but we are very traditional. We came from low income families and recieved financial aid at Cornell but we always felt like we were judged at Cornell. Today we are still just well enough off to pay our bills after graduating nearly 8 years ago. I don't donate because we feel as though we did not make it better than lower middle class. I work and my wife is a housewife because she couldn't find a good job in the area in which we live. We live in a regular trailer out in a rural area because we couldn't afford a home even after graduating Cornell. The reason my wife decided not to work is because our taxes would be higher if she did and she's a great organizer who saves money in our household by shopping wisely and saving a lot with coupons as frugal living has become necessary for us. She's also great at taking care of our trailer so we don't have to hire a cleaning lady. We figured we can live frugally and save money that way. I am just happy we can live comfortably even though we have a little bit of debt left on our student loans. After finding out what Cornell really is, I don't think I would send our kids to school here or anywhere in general because it's not worth the hard work and effort we had to put in especially if we had to pay full tuition. Our kids might be better off getting a real career as a plumber or as a skilled union laborer rather than going to school. These people make more money than most kids graduating from college these days and they have a skill sought out in the real world rather than a theoretical textbook view that most jobs could care less about. When we both graduated and started looking for jobs no one really asked us about what we knew but it's good that we both had some skills since my dad ran a business and allowed both of us to get some real world experience that helped us more than our wasteful education at Cornell. It's just a piece of paper that's worthless. I'm glad I didn't have to pay much to become a janitor.
