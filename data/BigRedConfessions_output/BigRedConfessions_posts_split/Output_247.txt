I've had it with everyone and everything here. It's my last semester of my senior year and I'm not enjoying any of it. All I want is to get the hell out of here and move on with my life. I'll be grateful to finally have my degree and be done with school, but aside from my degree and education I can't think of anything positive that I'll be taking with me. It's a little depressing to think about - it's not for lack of trying. I joined a sorority, joined clubs...I just didn't make any deep connections and honestly won't miss anyone here.
