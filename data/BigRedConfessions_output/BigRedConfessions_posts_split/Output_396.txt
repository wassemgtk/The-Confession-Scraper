I've been with my boyfriend for a few years now, and he's really sweet. We have a great relationship. He's smart, supportive, and we're pretty compatible. However, I can't shake this feeling that I want to sleep around. I would never cheat on him, but I'm wondering if it's worth ending this otherwise good relationships over something like this. I've only got a few months left of college, and I can't shake this feeling of wanting to experience sex with more people than just him. Any advice?
