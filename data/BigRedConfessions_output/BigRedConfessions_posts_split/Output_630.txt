I just read some of my old facebook message and text convos that I had with crushes and had a visceral physical reaction. Beyond cringe-worthy. I literally balled up while laying down on my couch and coiled into a semi-fetal position, eyes closed. I was just reading them and thinking to myself...what the hell was wrong with me? Sigh...it had to be done. I must never forget.
