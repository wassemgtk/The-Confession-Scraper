I have been single for a year now. I was in a very unhappy relationship for a long time and breaking up felt like the right thing to do. I was convinced I was going to find someone soon and I will then have my share of happiness and togetherness I felt I deserved. I have had no luck till now. I like a guy in my class, atleast I did, but he turned out to be an arrogant person. I went out of my way to help him ( which I would have done for anyone ) but when I need help he always has reasons to not help me. He seems to be very friendly when he needs my help and at other times doesn't even acknowledge me. I tried hard to make myself believe that he is not that petty at this stage of life but turns out he is and now I have lost interest in him. His actions make me feel like he thinks I am way out of his league. I wish I still liked him though, would have given me something to hold on to, something to look forward to. Everything just feels empty now. I hope next semester will be better than this one
