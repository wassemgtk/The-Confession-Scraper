Quite frankly, I do not want to give up on my relationship. Two years, and the most amazing feeling of love I have ever experienced, but recently, I've felt ignored and forgotten. I've felt like my problems are driving us apart. I stood by you through the lowest point in your life, but you don't seem to have the strength to do the same for me now that I'm experiencing things I've never had to deal with before. I love you so much it hurts, but maybe letting go would be best because I'm tired of crying more from the feeling you don't care than I do from the fact that my entire life is falling apart.
