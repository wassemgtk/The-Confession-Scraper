I love Cornell, I am so glad things worked out and I ended up here. I have the most amazing teammates on the women's track team. They inspire me to be the best I can be everyday and I hope I can make the future freshman on our team feel this way too. The spirit of our team in contagious.Thanks so much to all of my teammates :)
