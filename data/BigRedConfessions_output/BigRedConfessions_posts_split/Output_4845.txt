I had liked a guy who made me feel intense emotions.  I felt exuberant after he talked to me like I meant something to him.  I felt bottomless sadness after he ignored me.  Now I've lost touch with him and the emotions are all gone.  I feel nothing and I'm convinced that I'll never like a guy the way I liked him.
