It's been a year since the last time we ever saw one another.

You came and visited me for Fall Break. It was so bittersweet. Right from the start, it felt like a goodbye; you were cold and distant, unable to conceal your frigidity...nothing like the girl I fell in love with. But I can't fault you for that - we hurt one another pretty badly. I guess that's easy to do when two people care about one another so much.

We'll never speak to one another again, never see one another again; I've spent many months coming to terms with that. I've made my peace with it, as much as a body can.

But you still own a piece of my soul; I can feel the hole in my heart where it belongs...it aches every time I hear one of our songs, or remember the scent of your hair. You've got that little piece of me tucked in your pocket, forever and always.

"I love you so much; never forget." Great line from a great song.

Every time the leaves turn to orange and gold, I'll pour out the spirits and raise my glass to you.

This one's for you, Red. I hope you're safe and warm, wherever you are.
