I came into Cornell wanting to join a sorority. I've always wanted the sisterhood/family/community aspect. But talking to other freshman who want to rush, it seems like everybody is just wants the party/social status part of it. Is that really what it is like here? I like to have fun and go to parties, but I'm not super into drinking and partying more than once a week. I don't know what to do.
