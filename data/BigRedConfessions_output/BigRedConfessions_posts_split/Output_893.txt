I fell in love with someone and over the course of a year they slowly changed and became more dark and selfish. It's hard when you love the perfect image of someone but they no longer match it. It makes it impossible to move on because you know they CAN be what you want but they never will be again. So now I just deal with frustration and sadness every day and I don't know what to do. I could make a list a mile long of reasons why I shouldn't be with her but at the end of the day I still find myself wanting to talk to her but I can't.
