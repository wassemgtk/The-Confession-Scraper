When I say I'm "alone," I mean in a romantic sense. I have everything I could ever want, and I really shouldn't be crying over this, but I want a guy in my life to love who will love me back. I can live without him, but still. And I've actually been through several relationships, all where the guy breaks up with me in the end, and I tell myself, "No big deal," and continue on my merry way. 

I know that I won't be forever alone and that people will come and go throughout my life, but it's during times like these when my confidence falters and I wonder if I'm wrong and that I'll truly be alone. I know I shouldn't judge my self-worth off of whether or not they stay with me, but sometimes I just can't help but wonder what is it about me that makes guys realize, "Oh fuck, this girl isn't as cool as I thought she was. Big mistake. My bad. Gotta go."

Oh well.
