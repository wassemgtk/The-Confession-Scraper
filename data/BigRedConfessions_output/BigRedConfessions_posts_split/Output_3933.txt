"I captured a local skunk in the Ithaca area and kept it as a pet in my apartment after getting its scent glands removed. Nobody knows about it. When I'm playing around in my room with her, my roommates assume that I'm in there with a girl and congratulate me the morning after. He he he. Jokes on them!
Note: I am not a furry."
