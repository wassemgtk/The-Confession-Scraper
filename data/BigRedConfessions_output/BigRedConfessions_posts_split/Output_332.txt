I have a somewhat embarrassing question to ask: Does Cornell allow you to take multiple leaves of absences and how long are they allowed to be? I'm afraid I won't be able to pay because my dad just lost his job. Can I go and work for a few semesters, come back and do school work? Also, is it possible to finish some work over the summer at comparable schools? I don't know who to turn to in this situation and I feel like my asshole advisor and the school deans would just tell me to leave. Any advice would be appreciated my fellow Cornellians!
