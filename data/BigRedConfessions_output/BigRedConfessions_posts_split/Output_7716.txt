I'm a CS 3110 TA. In several semesters of TAing the class, I've never seen a class that collectively whined so much until last Fall. You're at an Ivy League university with a highly ranked CS department. We can't give you the answers in office hours, we can't extend (easy) projects because you can't handle the curriculum. Last semester we passed a lot of people we shouldn't have. This semester we won't be. We've been told we cannot do this again and this semester we will fail people that don't know the material. If you can't get it without us telling you how to step by step, pick a new major, you won't pass in this one.
