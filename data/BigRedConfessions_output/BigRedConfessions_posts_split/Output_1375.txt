I'm unattractive, disliked by many people, and have barely existent job prospects. I'm constantly crying because I'm sad/anxious about the above things, and especially the last thing. I feel like I have a lot of potential in my career field; it's just that Cornell went a little too quickly for me and I never got the chance to fully fine tune my skills. In general, I see people here with their lives together and I just feel profound sadness because compared to them, I'm nothing. Having only really one true friend to talk to (with others who hate me) doesn't do much for my self esteem either. I'm not one to whine and bitch in front of others, so I keep all my emotions bottled up. Because of my pain and insecurities, I always give off this emotionally distant vibe when I meet new people. It really sucks and I promise I don't do it on purpose. I really hope that all those people out there who think I'm a b*tch will forgive me- I'm just going through a lot of personal insecurities right now, and I can't even explain or control what I'm feeling.
