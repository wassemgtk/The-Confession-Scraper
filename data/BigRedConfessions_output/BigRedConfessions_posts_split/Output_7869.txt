"I hate how petty and immature you all are.  The appropriate response to the vast majority of these confessions is to grow up and to stop spending time with children.  don't know how to tell somebody they like you?  try moving your lips and vocal chords... if thats too hard, try moving your lips and tounge instead.  Your roommate is mean?  Boo hoo, we go to a school of 13k people, you can find somebody else to be your friend.  Never been kissed?  Get trashed and kiss somebody.  Or be sober around trashed people.  Your problems are far more likely a result of who you are than your surroundings.  If you want to change who you are, just do it.

Sometimes I feel like half of us figured out how to solve our problems and the other half just never bothered."
