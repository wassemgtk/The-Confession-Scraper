I just want to let you know that I miss being your friend. The last time we really hung out and actually interacted with each other to any significant degree, we were alone together for the first time and we had so much fun! We always got along so well despite how different we are, and I can honestly say that you're exactly the type of person that I came to Cornell to meet: someone that is as friendly as you are, someone that is totally unlike me, and above all, someone that's wildly more intelligent than I could ever hope to be. I can't be too specific about what we did or where we went because then you'll instantly know who I am and I think that you'd find this more strange and unexpected than flattering if you found out that I wrote this. But I still want to let you know my perspective - in case anyone's out there wondering, the only hint I'll give is that this hangout was a totally sober and platonic evening, and I'm a dude and she's a girl.

But that was a while ago, anyway. I still don't really know what changed or if this was even intentional, but I think that you started to avoid me after that night - it wasn't like you changed behavior overnight, but I didn't see you for a little while and the next few times I saw you, you had started acting differently around me. You stopped sitting near me in lecture unless there was at least one mutual friend between us, we stopped texting, and pretty soon it was like we had never met at all. I figured that you had thought it was a date or something and didn't want to lead me on, so I decided to let you have your space. And months later, when we were both a little buzzed (surrounded, of course, by mutual friends), you started talking to me a little again - but something just didn't seem right with you. It was a little subtle, but there was something very different in your tone of voice (it was noticeably bitter, which is unsettlingly different from your usual warm lightheartedness) and the subjects of conversation that you wanted to talk about were definitely a little... darker. You've changed a lot since we first met and especially over the last few months, and while I get that people change and that's a part of life, I'm worried that something happened to you or that there's something wrong that you're not telling me (or worse, not telling anybody else). But now I feel like I'm too distant of a friend to bring it up or that you'll think I'm simply judging you rather than trying to be a caring friend, and maybe it's possible that I'm just being a little paranoid and reading too much into things. I just hope that you're okay and that the brilliant, beautiful friend I miss is still in that crazy head somewhere, because the girl I see now seems like a shade of the one I knew.

I miss you, and I care about you, and I hope that you're going to be okay and that I'll get to witness your warm personality again sometime before we eventually graduate. I've started to move on to other friends because I feel like you don't want to be around me any more, and sadly it looks like I won't be getting to know you nearly as much as I'd like, no matter how many more classes we'll probably have together. I just wish I knew what happened and why you've changed so much, but I guess I'll never know - in a matter of years, we'll never see or hear from each other ever again. If you ever want to talk or be friends again, you know how to reach me. Otherwise, I guess that this is my last real goodbye to you. I only wish the best for you, and that hopefully someday we can be real friends again.

Goodbye.
