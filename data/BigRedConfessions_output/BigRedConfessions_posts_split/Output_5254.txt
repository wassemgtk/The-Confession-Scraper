I only knew you for 37 days before we graduated... I know there's nothing that can be done now - we're literally half a country apart and I might never see your beautiful face in person ever again. I wish I would have known you were going through the same struggles freshman year that I was ...and walked just down the hall to meet you and turned 37 into 1100 or so.
