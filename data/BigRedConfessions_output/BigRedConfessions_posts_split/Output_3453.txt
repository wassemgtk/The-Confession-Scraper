She said she had to leave me because the thought of being my happiness scared her, and I needed to focus on myself. It's so hard because I haven't been able to love myself in a long time, and there isn't anything good about me. I regret that I had shown her my depression, my weakness, and now she doesn't want to be around me. I'm a terrifying burden. From now on, I know to keep it to myself. It's time to put my happy go lucky mask back on. The same one I had perfected to keep people from my horrible self. I hope that maybe some day you will see my mask and decide that we can at least be friends.
