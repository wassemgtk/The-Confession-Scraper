Often times I feel that my friends are unappreciative of their parents' generosity. Some of us are struggling daily to keep a job (or multiple) and keep our grades up at the same time. I could not choose what class I was born into. I could not decide how much my parent would support me. Despite this, I try my best to balance work and classes, hoping it will pay off in the future. Thank your parents. They deserve it.
