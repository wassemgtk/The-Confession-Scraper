I have a real problem. I cannot go a day without masturbating. I wake up in the morning, go to class, and during a break I'll find time to go to the bathroom and masturbate. It's fucked up, really. I've been late to events, I've put off work, all just to masturbate. I've masturbating on planes, trains, even a bus.

I know that virtually everyone at college masturbates. And that's even more fucked up. Everyone here masturbates all the time, yet no one admits it. Masturbating has to be the best kept secret of all time. Chances are, if you're in a public restroom, the person in the next stall is probably masturbating. Isn't there something fucked up with that?

I consider myself an introverted person, and I hate it. I am naturally awkward, and I go through these awful mood swings where I just cannot tolerate human interaction and I'm just overall depressed with the quality of my life. I've never had a girlfriend, or really any girl who has expressed interest in me. I have a stuttering problem, and it is generally difficult for me to give off a good impression of myself and just make new friends. I know I'm fairly attractive, so the personality I exude must be deficient in some way, shape, or form. I want to be more outgoing, I want to have more people to talk to, but I just don't. I take out this frustration and anxiety by masturbating. In reality, though, I should be facing my social fears and be productive with my time. But it's way easier to jack-off. This has made me socially inept, and an overall weird and lazy person. I know I can do better.

I'm going home for Fall Break, and I'm looking forward to reflecting on how my freshman year's been going, and what I can do moving forward. One thing I'm going to try to do when I return after the break is to stop masturbating. It's a bad addiction. Stroking my penis is literally consuming my life. Not only am I wasting time doing this stupid activity, but I actually think this habit is affecting me psychologically. I've been reading the sub-Reddit "NoFap," and there's a lot of positive things to be said about quitting masturbating. You become more motivated to do things in life, you have a greater sex drive, and you become more extroverted. I want to meet more people, I want people to like me, I want to do amazing things, and I think quitting masturbation is a step in the right direction towards achieving these goals. I know it's not going to be easy to end this addiction, but I'm up for the challenge. By abstaining from masturbating, I will become more self-reliant and confident in my abilities. College is all about trying new things, and I seriously think this will make me happier.
