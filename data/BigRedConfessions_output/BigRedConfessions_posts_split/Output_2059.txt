"I was recently accepted into Cornell--CALS. It is my dream school and I can't begin to tell you how immensely proud and suprised I was accepted!!...and not rejected or not put on the wait list. I'm so excited and very nervous about the workload! I know, I got this (I hope!) I'm also doing PSP. But, I'm scared. I was always a social caterpillar in high school and easily made friends. I'm scared that people won't like my craziness or weirdness. I'm scared people won't find me attractive. I'm scared that I won't find my ""squad.""

 While this seems like a petty thing to be concerned about, let me defend myself by saying this: if I am not comfortable in my environment I do not do well. And I can't control how people see me or know what they think of me. I can't believe I'm doubting myself right now. I know I'm stronger that this but sigh. I made some friends with the help of Facebook Groups but idk I get offended quickly if someone doesn't like my comment or comments back. I take it personal and I want to get over it, but I feel like I'm over thinking it. As mature as I appear, I have insecurities that I can't conquer yet. It's eating me alive. 

Any advice on how to get over my fear of being in a new environment, making friends, and staying confident would be greatly appreciated. "
