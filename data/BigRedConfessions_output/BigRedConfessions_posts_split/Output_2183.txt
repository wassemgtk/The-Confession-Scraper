To the guy whom I hooked up with: you're a coward. I let you into my home, shared a bottle of wine and some interesting conversation and treated you extraordinarily well. I had no expectations except for you to communicate clearly and let me know whether or not you wanted to make this a regular thing. I don't understand why you just can't say, "No, I'm not interested," instead of doing exactly what you said you wouldn't do: say nothing. Someone claiming to be a humanist should know better. Yuck, take note, everyone. Don't treat people like that...for a number of reasons but especially because we live in a much smaller world than you'd imagine....
