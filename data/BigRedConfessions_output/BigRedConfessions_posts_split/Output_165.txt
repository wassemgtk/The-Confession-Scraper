No matter how well things are going, girls I really like always eventually stop texting me back. For no particular reason, they just phase me out of their lives after 1-2 dates. My record is 3 dates and I've tried a lot. I don't see one ever sticking around. They just lose interest. :( The sad thing is I'm not ugly either. They generally agree to go out with me, and I am okay with first impressions, but once they realize how much of a dork/awkward I am, they lose interest. So much sadness, so much rejection...
