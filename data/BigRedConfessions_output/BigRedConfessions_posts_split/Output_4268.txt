To those who do not understand what sexual assault does to a person, I like to share my story. I was 9 years old when an older student on the bus home pulled my pants down and forcibly fingered me and forced my face onto his penis. No, I didn't scream. I was to scared, I knew nothing about my body or what was going on. I cried as he told me this is what good girls do. It happened again before he switched bus routes. 
 I felt so violated, helpless, and lost. I told no one because upbringing said anything sexual was shameful. I feared to be touched, I'd cry during physicals for years. It is still ever present in my mind, sorry society it doesn't just disappear. It still effects me, I hate masturbating and I have little desire for sex (even though I have a loving, understanding fiance). I also have anxiety disorder on top of that. 
 Unlike some, I do not see my abuser walking around our campus and not being held accountable. That is what we must change. So do not take what happens to so many of my sisters and brothers lightly. Stop the rape jokes and tear down this rape culture.
