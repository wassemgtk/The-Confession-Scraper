I'd like to believe that there is someone out there who would think of me and cry every time they listen to Passenger's "let her go". Cos I do. Every time I listen to the song, I think of him and what we could have been, if he gave me a chance. I might be an idiot, in love with someone who doesn't love me back, as usual. But I would like to believe that he is just holding back and he loves me too. Sigh
