I haven't had sex in a year. I'm an attractive female grad student, but I'm shy until the ice breaks. I was in a long-term relationship, but after we broke up I threw myself into my studies, and before I knew it a whole year went by. I'm crazy about sex, but I'm not really into the current hook-up culture, and that seems to be all anyone wants anymore.
