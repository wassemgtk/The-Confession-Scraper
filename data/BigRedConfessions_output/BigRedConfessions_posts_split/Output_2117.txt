Need advice:

I'm a virgin and have never kissed a girl or been shown any kind of affection beyond a simple hug or maybe a girl sitting close to me. I have a girlfriend (relationship is only a couple weeks old) and I know for a fact that she has had much more sexual/intimacy experience than myself. She seems to think I'm well versed in all this, maybe because I've been playing everything real smooth and also because I lied and said that I wasn't a virgin (not to her, but to a few of our mutual friends and I never have explicitly stated or acted otherwise whenever sex is brought up in the conversation). 

I could hope that my smooth chillness or whatever will translate to a very natural, impressively executed loss of virginity--that I will open up the condom quickly and with confidence, slip it on like I've done it drunkenly 1000 times before, and do all the things I've hoped to do for a woman once I met someone worth being in a serious relationship with (only took 21 years of life haha.) 

But somehow I know that is extremely unlikely, especially since I'm notoriously awkward and uncoordinated when it comes to women and just physical activity in general. This could be a nightmare for both of us. We're inching closer and closer to making out, and then Sex. I just know it.

My question is: Should I tell her the truth before that moment so she can be prepared for a terrible, inexperienced kisser/ love maker or should I just wing it and hope for the best so as not to risk ruining the moment with my honesty and teenager-like anxiety/flaws?
