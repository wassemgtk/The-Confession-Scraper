"I need advice, and I didn't know where to turn. I know this is trivial (even though it seems like a big deal to me). All my friends are rushing (obviously I'm a freshman) and I'm not ( I'd like to, but parents, money blah blah blah...) I'm not happy about that (because I really wanted to...) but I'm dealing with it (nope...but let's just pretend i am). I don't know how West housing works, who you room with or anything. I'm kind of scared, because I have NO idea who I would even room with because all my friends are going to be in a sorority. How easy is it to make new friends second semester? I know its not like I'm loosing them, but I feel left out. 

I know this so so so so trivial. Even when i re-read this post I'm gagging. But I thought I would ask.
How easy is it to make friends second semester freshman year? Is it hard when all your friends are (potentially) in greek life and you're not?  What's west campus like?
