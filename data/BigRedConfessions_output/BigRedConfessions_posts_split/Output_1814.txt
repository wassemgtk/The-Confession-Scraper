I really want to fall in love with someone right now, but I don't have anyone particular in mind. I've got a fraternity date event coming up in less than two weeks, and I keep hoping I'm going to meet the perfect girl in a class or in a cafe on campus or at a party or through a friend.

I've listened to Michael Buble's ""Haven't Met You Yet"" an embarrassing amount of times.
