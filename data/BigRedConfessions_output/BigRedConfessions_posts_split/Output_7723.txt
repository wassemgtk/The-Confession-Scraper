I have many different friend groups.  I get to see them all and get to hang out quite frequently with them.  yet despite all this, I feel so alone.  I am able to talk about deeper things like the meaning of life and of love and of my wants and dreams with them on many different levels.  But I never feel like I am completely understood.  I never feel like I get to know all of each friend as I wish I could.  I want to be able to see people for who they truly are behind any barriers or walls they put up....I want people to see me. I want to be truthful. But I don't know if I completely know myself.... Some days I just sit in buildings like Physical Sciences or Olin and just look out the window, people watching.  each person I see I know I will never meet, yet I still wonder where they are going, who they will be meeting up with, what they want to do with their life, etc... Yet I am only able to see a glimpse of their life in front of me... I just want someone who will do this with me. Who wonders. Who questions. Who wants to know who these people are that we will never be able to meet.   I just don't want to feel alone amongst a crowd.  Does anyone else at Cornell experience these feelings? I feel like so many people are so well put together, while I just listen to the same sad songs on loop all night. On the outside I am a very happy outgoing person.  I have a very active social life, and am very dedicated to my work, always am busy. Yet I stil end up finding time to lay around on my bed and just stare up at the ceiling wondering, Who am I? What is life all about?  I care very much about people and am always there for them, but where are my friends who are there for me? Sorry for the rambling... I am having a somewhat sad reflective kind of night. Im tired of the friends that know I feel this way telling me to talk to gannett or professionals.  That isn't what I want. I want to feel connected to my friends. I want them to accept me for who I am. I want to know who they are without any barriers. I want them to do for me what I am always ready to do for them....That is my solution. I want that support. that community. Where are you Cornell?
