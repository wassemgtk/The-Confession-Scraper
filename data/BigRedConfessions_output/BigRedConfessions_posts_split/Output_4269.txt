Ok, here’s the deal:  I’m sick and tired of your shit.  Yes, you fools who put a mattress in front of Day Hall with the words “Skorton, here is your oral warning, we’re fighting back” spray-painted on it.  First of all, it’s written, not oral, you abysmally stupid fucks (at least pretend you’re intelligent enough to go to Cornell).  Secondly, what the hell are you even talking about?  Cornell has a highly developed system in place to address sexual assault.  In fact, it goes so far as to remove the suspected rapist’s “innocent until proven guilty” rights, which I actually appreciate (in my opinion, rapists deserve no rights; if I were in charge, rape would merit a life sentence in prison).  But all of this leaves me wondering what your complaint is.  I have no doubt that there are improvements that could be made to the judicial system, but how about you address them like civilized human beings?  Like maybe in writing, or at Skorton’s open office hours?  But I must say, I’d like to see what kind of pointless, juvenile way you choose to “fight back”, you dim fuckers.  I laugh at your empty threat written on a soggy mattress.  On a different note, do you want to know what the worst part of this whole situation is?  That it’s impossible to take the other side without getting torn apart.  I just watched on the Overheard at Cornell Facebook page as one guy with good intentions stood up against everyone else (he was arguing for due process in the trials of rapists, which is a valid point).  And then I watched him get shot down.  But it wasn’t about the quality of his argument, it was about the people he was de facto supporting.  When he said “but what about due process for rapists?”, everyone fired back with “so you support rape?”.  That wasn’t what he was saying, and that isn’t what I’m saying.  He and I (as well as every other decent male on this campus) hate rapists with every fiber of our beings.  So if you want to involve the student body in your campaign, you’re doing it wrong.  You’re not leaving any room for conversation to take place, and you’re turning people away from your cause.  And to the people who left the mattress message:  grow up.  When you do, I’ll pick up a banner and join the protest."

You don't hear about the written letters, or the survivors talking to the administration about their respective crimes, OP. You likely only hear about when survivors go to court because the administration silences the survivor, or when the media gets involved. It's severely under-reported, and the administration would rather have the survivor shut up about it. The event yesterday, as well as the tell-tale mattress represents a turning point in a dialogue that was silenced by university administrations across the nation. If you "hate rapists with every fiber of your being," then join those who fight against rape culture. ]
