Why is it that the only person I told, my best friend I had ever had, couldn't be bothered to help me when I was on the verge of killing myself? You were the only person who I wanted to talk to, and your work was more important? My life was saved thanks to someone who found me in the alley, and now I'm left alone and wondering if I made the right choice that night.
