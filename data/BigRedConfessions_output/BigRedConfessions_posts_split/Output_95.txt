wtf.  there are so many sinks for my attention.  for your attention.  what are you doing on here?  wasting time?  wasting brain power.  day dream, motherfuckers.  daydream.  don't let your thoughts be guided by someone else (unless you're reading this post, which you are, so....... JUST GET OFF THE SCREEEEEEEN).  God.  why is it so easy to get lost in technology?  it's easy because it's easy.  that is all there is to it.  it's easier than reading Lord of the Rings.  it's easier than writing your own fucking poem.  it's easier than sitting in the common area and talking with some strangers.  wtf are we doing here.  wtf.
