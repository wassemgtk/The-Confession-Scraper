"Recently, I lost my virginity. I am not a person you would think still has his virginity. I have hooked up a decent amount and have done everything else. I even had an opportunity another time, but didn't have a condom. But, I digress, I kind of like this girl, but I'm not sure what to do. Somebody once told me that ""try all the ice cream flavors first"" before choosing your favorite. I don't want to miss out on anything and I don't want to be clingy. There's so many other flavors I have yet to try. So, back again to this girl, I want to ask her out on a real date because she's actually cool, but I am afraid that I will be missing out on other ""flavors.""

Furthermore, she stopped texting me. We've texted quite a bit, but recently the texts have stopped, replaced by silence. 

So, if she does text back (which at this point I don't think she will) should I ask her on a date? But, maybe she doesn't want a relationship. Fuck, this is confusing."
