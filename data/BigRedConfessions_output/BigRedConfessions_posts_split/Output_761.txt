It's a damn shame that humanities fields aren't inherently valued as much as STEM fields are in the workforce. There's plenty of stuff I'd love to learn about WAY more than what I'm studying now, but I can't study that stuff in depth because it ain't gonna put cash on the table. 

A lot of people paint romanticized visions of college as the one time where you can truly pursue your interests and explore who you are and whatnot, but I feel like I have to instead treat college like some boot camp for the workforce. And it's very frustrating.
