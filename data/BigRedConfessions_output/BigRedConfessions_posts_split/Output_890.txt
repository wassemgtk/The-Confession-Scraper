I am the most conservative person on this campus, and I am voting for Donald Trump come this election. If only the non-conservative people I associate at Cornell knew, I would need to hire a private armed body guard. I support all of Donald Trump's measures because he follows the logic of my favorite talk show host, Michael Savage. If only people listened to Michael Savage, we could make this country great again and reduce the problems that exists. I wish I could come out to more people and they could embrace me, rather than shun my beliefs.
