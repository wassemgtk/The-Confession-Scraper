Gay guy here, (not trolling) I don't understand the crazy passion and anger that went into the rights for gay marriage. Sure it's a nice thing, but at the end of the day, it's a meaningless ceremony that started as a religious one. We don't live in some Bob Ross world where everyone is a happy little person with equal rights, sometimes you get the butt-end of the stick and you just deal. I don't understand why any gay person would want to be associated with a religious ceremony that scrutinizes homosexuality. People need to chill. Also fuck those SJW shitters at Yale. And fuck Hillary, that lying psychopath. /rant
