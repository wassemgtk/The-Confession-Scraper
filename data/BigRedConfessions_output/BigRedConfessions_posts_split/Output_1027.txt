I'm taking a class right now where the professor is a bit on the young side, so he understands things about our post-teenage culture, like memes and random songs. However, he's also a bit of a dick, and recently I learned just how much of one he is. Some kid asked about the way the class was graded, and instead of pointing to the guy to the syllabus like any other professor would, said professor decided it would be okay to mock the student and tell him to look at the syllabus via a meme. It came across as like... "why would you ask such a dumb question, just read the syllabus you moron".

I mean, don't get me wrong, the kid is super annoying and I would probably do that too, but a professor should respect his students regardless of his personal views on their demeanor.  I don't think that kid did anything wrong, but the professor probably got tired of his shit. Sorry not sorry? The kid didn't seem too fazed by it, but I think I'm going to refrain from answering questions now, lest the professor mock me for giving a wrong answer or some shit. Man, what a world it is, where you can't even trust your professors to show you some respect.
