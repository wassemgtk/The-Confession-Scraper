there's a girl around here that I see from time to time and I need to know her name. I NEED TO. I believe she's a freshman. shes a red bone (could be black, I suppose), a short girl that is maybe about 5'2, and really fit. I see her at Helen Newman sometimes. She hangs out with a white girl a lot, usually they work out together and I've seen them in the library together. She's absolutely gorgeous. I wish I could tell you more about her...any guesses?
