I graduated in May, couldn't find a job, so my parents threw me out of the house and now I am living on the street. I occasionally get to use the computer at the library for free and spend my days there, but other than that I typically sleep on a park bench or in a subway station where it's warm because the homeless shelters are filled with crazies or people who have extreme illnesses and are unsanitary. I think I am the worst alumnus ever and I just feel hopeless. :/
