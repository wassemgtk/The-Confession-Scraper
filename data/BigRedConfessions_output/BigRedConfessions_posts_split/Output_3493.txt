Dad,
I sit here in my dorm room writing this letter three days before your birthday. Wow, this is already hard. I miss you. I like to think that there is a heaven and you are up there watching me live my life. Because it makes me sad to think that my dad doesn't know how I'm doing, what I'm doing, or how much I've already achieved. It's hard because you never expect your dad to not be there, not be able to celebrate everything. Like how you said that we'd get drinks on my 21st. Well, I'm 21 now and I'm going to have a drink for you on your birthday.
In case you didn't know, I've done some really awesome, exciting stuff. I'm even at Cornell! I'm 99% sure you'd be extremely proud of me.
The one thing I really hope you know though is that I love you. I really, really love you. No matter what. It's been hard since you left this world. I can't even believe it will have been five years this September. But I trust your judgement that heaven was going to be a happier place for you. And I still love you. I forever will.
With much love, I hope you have a good one, complete with cake, chocolate, fish & chips, and tea. 
Happy birthday, daddy.
