I lost one of my best friends that I ever had here at Cornell. She didn't die or any of that stuff. I alienated her. I got so caught up in doing extracurricular work and took on to many of those responsibilities and I couldn't handle the stress. That excess stress went to her and I basically yelled at her and called her filthy names whenever she made fun of my bad sleeping habits or any of my personal details(although it's due to the fact I'd been an addicted to pills after I saw one of my friends pass away in high school and I've been clean for 5 years, but the stress is making me revert back to eccentric patterns and behavior. The irony is that I used to do journalism and extracurricular work in high school as a way to take my mind off my friend, but now it's just working against me). I don't wanna tell my friend these things because I don't want her to be scared of me and what I am capable of doing in terms of hurting myself. Of course,this plan backfired as it resulted in her not knowing me at all and I take on the apparition of an ass-wipe. It also backfired on me because I don't make many friends out of the fear of losing them, as I did my closer friend in high school.

Even worse, I'm also "unsupportive" of her ambitions, but I really don't feel that way. I'm glad you got the stuff you wanted and you're in a good place. But I also feel that she can do better, and she thinks that invalidates my previous compliment.

Now, she doesn't want anything really to do with me, and I feel lonely because I alienated everyone to the point I have nobody if she's not there.

I get it. I'm a shitty friend. and I'll gladly admit that. But what I'm worried about are the steps I need to take to be the best friend one could possibly ask for, because I'm ready to change. I know it's too late to be there for her and she being happy about it, but I'm sure I can do something differently as to not repeat history.

So, guys.... what are your suggestions?
