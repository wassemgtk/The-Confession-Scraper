I'm leaving Cornell and I have nothing to show for my time here but missed opportunities. The same can be extrapolated to my life. It's so stupid to just be genetically predisposed to not enjoy life. I am perfectly healthy, I'm smart and got into Cornell on my own merit with near full funding, I am above average looking, I will most likely get a great job... There is nothing preventing me from having a perfect life and enjoying it, but I just can't and I don't. I've never been happy. All the things that make people happy - money, family, boyfriend/girlfriend, friends, job, entertainment, going out, etc. I find absolutely no substance in. The only thing that ever made me happy was being alone with my thoughts and that's started to lose its value. I see no point to life. And I mean that in the most apathetic way possible. Meaning I'm not depressed/suicidal or anything. That would require me to have an attitude toward life. I have no attitude. There's just nothing.
