"Someone stole my coat last night at Pixel. Maybe I would be less upset if it didn't have my keys in it and it wasn't the coat given to me by my sister who is currently in the Army and I have no idea when I will see her again. 
It's people like this that make me hate the people even more. Do you not realize how much of a dick you're being by stealing someone's coat and then not returning it?
Please give it back. I won't be angry if it was a mistake and if it was on purpose, then get a friend to return it so you're not incriminated. But just give it back with my keys please."
