I'm reading all these sad confessions about missing someone and I'm just like chill out, you will love again. You are free. You are vindicated. This is a new chapter in your life. Love yourself again. Don't be pathetically pining for someone. But while I'm not sitting in my room crying for you, I miss you so much. This is a loss. I miss kissing you, having sex with you, being in the library with you, talking about random stuff or classes. I wish there was a way for you to still be in my life. I wish I knew whether you wanted that in the least, but we both have too much pride and too big egos and I need to resign as Bob the builder because maybe I can't fix this as much as I've tried.
