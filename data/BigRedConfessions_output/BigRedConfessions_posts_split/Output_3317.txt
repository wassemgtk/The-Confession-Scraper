Looking forward to working out tomorrow and seeing familiar faces in the gym. Gym = home. Go have your flowers and sex, people. In 2 years I'll be a buff dude in my prime and all the girls will flock to me (I was told that's how it works), and in 2 years you'll still be skinny people who may or may not be with someone. Invest in a good body early - enjoy a life as a living legend longer.
