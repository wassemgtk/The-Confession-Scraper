I've been told dozens of times, "Pursue what you love and money will follow."  Well, I'm fucked.  I love sleeping and watching movies.  I love working out.  I love not adhering to a schedule.  I love being isolated and independent.  I can't really make money doing these things.  And if anyone out there knows of a way I can, please let me know.  I want that job.
