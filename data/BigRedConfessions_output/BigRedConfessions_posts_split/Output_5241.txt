The reason these Elliot Rodger killings have struck such a nerve is that a lot of people – myself included – can identify with some of the feelings he raised in his “manifesto” and in his videos. What, does that make me an asshole? I’d be willing to bet there’s a lot of other people reading this who can read some of the things he expressed and see something similar to what they’ve felt. This cultural emphasis on sex as a measure of self-worth damages guys too. Did Rodger do terrible things? Obviously. Is there any excuse for what he did? Of course not. But lots of people out there can identify with him in a way no one identified with James Holmes or Adam Lanza et al. There’s nothing wrong with seeing that.
