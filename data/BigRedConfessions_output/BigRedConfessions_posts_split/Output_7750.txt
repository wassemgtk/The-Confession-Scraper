I'm clinically depressed pending diagnosis of bipolar.  And the worst part? I have to deal with regular people problems too.  Friends who don't understand me. A guy friend who doesn't understand that I just don't see him that way. And another guy who cares way too much for me and is terrified to be with me. Yes, I am mentally ill and unstable, but all I want is for people to ignore that fact unless I bring it to the forefront.  I want to be treated like a normal person and not like someone who's going to go to pieces in a second. Because you know what? I'm more likely to go to pieces when I'm treated that way. And I don't want that anymore than they do.
