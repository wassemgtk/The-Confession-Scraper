"I was flagged for federal verification, so I still haven't gotten my financial aid package. But couldn't Cornell look at my stuff and give me an estimate? Tuition is more than our income, so I'm basically crying myself with worry to sleep every night, debating registering for community classes (BTW I'm not a freshman). C'mon Cornell. Way to take five years off my life.

Has anyone gotten significantly less money the second year?? Our income increased by 30,000, but it's still under the poverty line and I'm just worried we will have to pay too much.
