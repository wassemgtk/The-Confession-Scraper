I found that I like freedom. The freedom to do things when I want without stress. So, I decided that I wanted independence. I am going to save money for 10-15 years after graduating and then retire. I don't have crippling student loans so my time frame could be smaller. I want to get up in the morning and drink tea while reading for two hours. I want to leave the country because I'm bored. I want to do whatever whenever I want. I want the power to say "fuck you" to anyone who makes me work. If that means living like a college student, so be it. This has also made me more focused on my studies because I have to get a high paying job. My dreams drive me and I know they are only 10-15 years away. Everything else is insignificant. Since then, my life has been a blur. I let go of things that truly do not matter. I'm so focused on my goal that nothing can stop me. It's a high like no other. You might be wondering if I might get bored. I mean a 35 year old guy with no job. What are you going to do? The beauty of it is: I don't know. Maybe I'll learn an instrument or live in another country. I might become a part time community college teacher. But the point is, those are all things I want to do. Totally up to me what I want to do with my time. Not work 40-60 hrs a week as an engineer, be stressed, or have kids. Sorry, I haven't told anyone this and I don't plan on it. I am overflowing with excitement. I had to let it out somehow. And who am I? That's one secret I'll never tell. xoxo g.g.
