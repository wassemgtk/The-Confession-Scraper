"While I am medically on the upper end of normal weight, I would consider myself really fat as my stomach probably has three inches on it that don't need to be there. I was wondering if I could get some anonymous fitness advice:

How should I be exercising when I only have at most 1-1.5 hours every other day to commit to exercising when I mainly want to lose stomach fat and gain a core? I don't want to be buff - just have no flab and *maybe* have a rough outline of abs. I know I can eat better (which I am on a mission to do so for the rest of the semester and over the summer), and can go harder on workouts, but am I doing the right exercises? I usually run for 20-30 minutes and then follow it up with equipment at the Cornell fitness centers, but I'm not organized in any way. What exercises should I do (or not do), and how should I organize them?

Thanks"
