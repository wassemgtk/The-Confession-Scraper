"Actually knowing somebody suffering from depression makes me angry at the lack of support given. I have always agreed that it isn't just as easy as thinking happy thoughts to feel better, but having somebody close to you attempt to end their own life makes me so angry that help is near impossible to get for some people. 
If people can send out good vibes, thoughts, or prayers to those suffering something just needs to be done. "
