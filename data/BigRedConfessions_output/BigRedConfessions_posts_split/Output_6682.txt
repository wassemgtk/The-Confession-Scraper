"You want to be friends? Fuck you. Here's 2 reasons why we can't be friends anymore. 

1) Every time I see you, I just tremble in the hopes of being able to hold your hands again. But that's never gonna happen again, I know. 

2) You never had any interest in me. Basically, you only led me on just so, for the first time, you could know what it felt like to be in complete control of another vulnerable human being. WOW. Go fuck yourself. 

You can take that friendship and stick it up your perfect ass.
