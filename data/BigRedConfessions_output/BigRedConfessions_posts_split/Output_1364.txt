To cut a long story short:

 I'm lonely, I'm frightened, I'm behind, and I can't speak about any of this because no one here knows me well enough to care or want to help me.

 I'm afraid to let people know me, mainly because I'm secretly a somewhat soft-hearted, well-meaning, very weird/contradictory naif who's put up a shell of coldness and aloof behavior to deal with constantly crap reality.  It's not that I don't want/have friends - but this wall I've put up makes it so difficult for me to reach out and make human contact. I can't stop projecting it now though - without it, I'm naked, free for the metaphorical vultures to peck at. You live with the mask for long enough and it's all that the world can see. 

I know there might be "easy" solutions to this problem, and that my problems in the grand scheme of things are relatively meaningless, so if you'd like to criticize my behavior on either of those fronts, go ahead, I know these things are probably true. I mainly just wanted a venting session though, and now I've gotten it, so I'll be attempting to get on with this business of living. 

Best of luck to all of you.
