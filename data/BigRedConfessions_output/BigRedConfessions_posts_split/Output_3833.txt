"God I wish I knew the person who posted that confession about wanting to go on coffee dates. Like everyone else I'm super busy and stressed but if you ask me out for coffee, I'll make the time.
We always have time for things we want guys.
When someone says they don't have time to date/be in a relationship, even if they're being sincere and really think they don't have the time, subconsciously it means they don't want to make the time for you. "
