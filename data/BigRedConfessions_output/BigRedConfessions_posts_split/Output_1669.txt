I do have friends, I laugh everyday, and I am quite optimistic. It's not that I am depressed, it's just that I haven't defined myself yet. Too often, I find myself easily slipping into different personas when I'm around different people or in different circumstances. It's like I haven't decided which version of myself to be. I'm not sure why that is, but frankly I'm tired of the uncertainty and self-doubt.

From this day on, I will be best version of myself because nobody could ever do that. For the record, I'm truly sorry that I disgust you, but normal doesn't exist.
