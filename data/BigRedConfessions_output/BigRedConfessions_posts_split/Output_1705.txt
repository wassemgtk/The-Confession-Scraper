It's so funny to me. In the past week, five different girls I know have either rescheduled/cancelled a get-together or brought someone else without any prior warning. Back when I was a dummy who fell in love too quickly and made poor decisions too often and read into everything too much and tried too hard without ever even asking anyone out on a legitimate date, this would have been a shitty time, and I would have had an illogical anger for these girls--my FRIENDS, who did nothing wrong at all. It's so funny to me who I used to be, and I know there are some poor guys out there who are still like me, though probably not nearly as bad because I was one of the all-time WORST when it comes social adeptness, reading signs, and pursuing a relationship. I really did NOT see things clearly, or understand these matters AT ALL. Not saying I'm an expert now, but I'm at peace, and I'm so much more difficult to upset these days, and I suddenly understand so much more. And I'm happy, and I'm confident, and I'm at ease. This is truly wonderful.
