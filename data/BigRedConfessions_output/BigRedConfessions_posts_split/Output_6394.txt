"I'm bisexual. I've known for a long time and yesterday I told my one of my best friends. She is the first person I have ever told and I was not expecting all of these emotions to go along with it. I didn't think it would be a big deal for me to finally tell someone, but today I feel like a whole weight has been lifted off my shoulders. I feel like a new person... jittery, happy and alive. I'm happy to be free. I don't feel the need for the whole world to know, but it is an amazing feeling to know I have someone to talk to who knows and will listen :)

Thank you for being there for me :)  
and have a good day!"
