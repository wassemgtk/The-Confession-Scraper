I've been depressed since long before I came to Cornell. Sometimes I just want to quit everything and run away but I can't. I feel trapped and I haven't felt anything close to happiness in a long long time. If you knew me, you probably wouldn't recognize me from this. As a matter of fact, I have friends, I laugh everyday and I might be one of the most optimistic people that you know . But only I know, deep down, I'm lost. I have a disgusting habit that I use to get away from everything but it damages my health, adds to my depression and makes me feel horrible about myself. I can't find interest in anything. All I do everyday is wandering around thinking about how much I hate myself. 
I get upset and self-destructive because of the stupidest thing. For example, there's this guy that I like, but I never had the courage to initiate a meaningful discussion. Whenever I see him gets close or flirty with a girl I would turn to my habit and waking up the next morning swearing that I had to change, but I never did.
I know nobody would want to be in a relationship with someone like me and tbh I don't think I could keep myself together if I am hurt by someone I love one more time. So I guess I should just sit around, keep hating myself and watching him being taken by some girl that is far more normal than me. I kinda brought it on myself, so I guess I deserve to be miserable anyway.
