We communicated, we hooked up, and then all of a sudden you texted me saying you weren't interested anymore. 

We started texting a couple of days ago. Then you texted me asking to come to your place for Netflix. I was excited to get to see you again, as I hope you were to see me again.

But then something happened: you cancelled on me again. For a second time. You have the right to make whatever decisions you want about where you want us to go from here, but you owe it to me to have consistent communication and to not juggle me around as if I were dispensable. 

I would like to see you again, one more time, for old times' sake. If you want to as well, then text me; you know who you are. If you don't, then just text me letting me know, and we never have to play this game again. I'll get the text and I won't respond.
