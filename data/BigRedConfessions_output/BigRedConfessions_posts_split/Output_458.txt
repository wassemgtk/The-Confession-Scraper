I hate that you hurt me and made me feel less whole.  I hate that this happened so long ago and it still bothers me. I hate that you made me feel lonely even when I was in a relationship with you. But what I hate worse is that you found someone new to be happy with and I am stuck here, alone, just hating being angry.
