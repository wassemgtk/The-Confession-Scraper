My mom makes me feel worthless. She hates my major, my career aspirations, and the way I look. All she ever talks about is how I need to lose weight, wear make up, and wear clothes she likes. I can't wait to graduate so I can move (hopefully across the country), change my number, and never have to hear her put me down ever again
