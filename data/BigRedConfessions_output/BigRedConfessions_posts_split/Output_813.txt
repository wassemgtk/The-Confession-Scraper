For half of last semester, I stayed up all night, went to breakfast, went to morning class, and then went to bed. Don't like getting up early for class? Make it an evening class! I also did very well in all of my classes, b/c there are few things to do at night but work. Other benefits -- no more alarms, you get to sleep as much as you want; going to class leisurely in the morning and being fresh and attentive when everyone else is struggling to stay awake; your professors will appreciate your focus, attention and attitude; you get to have breakfast for dinner! If you're already a night person, try it.
