Sometimes I wish I still had my friend at Cornell to talk to because I feel lonely. Not in the sense that I don't have anyone to talk to but because I feel isolated. I cannot sit in one place for too long because I get bored easily, and depressed. I need to move around, explore, see new things constantly. I need to invigorate my hunger for knowledge and learn about the past constantly, especially things of a certain time period in which I love. My friend knows my fetish for this, but we are completely different people and don't see eye to eye. I wish I had a friend who could check things out for me that are what I like in another town/state that I cannot go on vacation to because of work obligations when I'm free. I would need them to act as an agent for me on a reconnaissance for me and obtain pictures of a few things for me, but high quality pictures not the iPhone type. I'm not talking about spying on anybody though. It's different, they just never took pictures of what I asked them to in the first place because they were busy I think. :/ Hopefully one day they could message me again and satisfy my hunger for knowledge.
