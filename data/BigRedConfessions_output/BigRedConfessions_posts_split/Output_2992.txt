My best friend thinks it's acceptable to hit on guys that are into me.  I wouldn't have any issue with this since she's boring and can't keep anyone's attention for long but she spends half the time insulting me in front of them.  The net result is I lose all interest in the guy and never want to see him again after being so embarrassed.  How can I make this a conversation instead of letting it continue to bother me and ruin our friendship?
