I've said it before and I'll say it again. I wish I was a high schooler in the 80s. I wish I could have been a Star Wars/Back to the Future geek but also be in a sex-driven environment like seen in the Breakfast Club and other great movies. (I naively, honestly was shocked to realize that people had sex in high school.) Don't get me started on the music.
