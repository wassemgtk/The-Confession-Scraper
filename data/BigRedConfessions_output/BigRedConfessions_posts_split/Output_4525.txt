I know some people don't agree with me on this but I think the guys on Cornell's campus are wayyy more attractive than a lot of them think. Guys, have some confidence - you're sexy with brains. Trust me, it's a great asset. If one person, or 50 rejects you, it doesn't mean you're not attractive or not desirable. It simply means that specific person is looking for something else. Keep on moving guys!
