Moving back home is just weird. Cleaning out my room felt strange - like I was just picking up and throwing out everything my life had become and so much that made me happy. Looking in at my empty room just before I locked the door made everything that happened here seem transient and replaceable when I still feel so attached. Guess I'm going to have to get used to being separated from all that I come to know and then being thrown back into the past every few months. Not to mention suddenly being thrown forward and starting all over again. Places seem so intertwined with emotional experiences for me. I look at my room at home and remember things I'd rather forget as well as times I never wanted to pass. Seems like it'd be easier to simply not see. I need a lesson in numbness. I know it's only a few months but it feels like such a crazy shift.
