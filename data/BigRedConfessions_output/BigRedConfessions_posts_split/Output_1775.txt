There was a post on here about income taxes previously. I have the same sentiment - why does the government deserve nearly 60% of my income every year? In the past 7 years or so my federal went from 35 to 39.6%, capital gains from 15 to 28%, no more deductions for charitable contributions or anything else, and now all of the government healthcare taxes. 

I do NOT deserve to work for 40 cents out of every dollar I make so that the government can get into even more massive debt and spend it away on stupid programs and wars
