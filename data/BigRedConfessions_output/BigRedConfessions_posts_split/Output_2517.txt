I love my family, but I think it's time I struck out on my own. It's hard to be independent when your family sees itself as this weird hive mind--I feel like Cersei under a less ruthless Tywin Lannister, constantly struggling to assert myself and being shut down every time. And as much as I feel responsible for them, I also don't want to give up my prime years taking on a burden that I probably shouldn't be carrying in the first place. College is supposed to be about learning and having fun, not becoming the de facto head of household. My mother gave up her life for her royally f-ed up family, and I think she expects the same of me. I'm getting the feeling that I should get the hell outta dodge before that can happen, but out of all of us, I make the most money, which means that my stipends, my grant money, my extra cash money goes to pay bills back home. How am I supposed to be independent (especially financially) when my family can take my earnings whenever they please? What happens if I do leave? How would that conversation even go?
