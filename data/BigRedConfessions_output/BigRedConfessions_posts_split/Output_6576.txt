We were in the same class last semester. He was always really sweet and nice to me, going extra lengths to help me out in class. I added him on Facebook to keep in touch once classes were over, but he still haven't accepted my friend request. We have mutual friends and I know he has been online. I just don't understand. It's not like I have feelings for him or anything. Is it that weird to want to be friends?
