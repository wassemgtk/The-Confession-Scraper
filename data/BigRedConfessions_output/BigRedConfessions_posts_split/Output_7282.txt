"I feel like my anxiety is consuming me. It is so difficult to set up an appointment with CAPS when all of the time slots are so far in the future and when my schedule is so unpredictable. I really need some help and someone to talk to, but I keep putting it off. There's so many different resources I don't even know what would be best for me, or if I should still try to make a CAPS appointment even though I might have to cancel for the 3rd time in a row. It's strange to think of how easily I used to shrug off mental illness as someone else's problem until I found myself with one. Now I understand.

However, I can't leave my first Cornell confession on a bad note. Although things have been getting rough this semester, I can honestly say that I've fallen in love with the best guy at school. He really looks out for me and I couldn't be more thankful for that, rain or shine.

I'm going to keep trying my best at this. It's going to hurt at times, but I'm going to get through it. For my parents, for my boyfriend, and most importantly, for myself. I just need to find those first steps- whether it be CAPS or EARS or, I don't know. Anything. "
