"Cornell's fucking broke, and I wish the Board and Administration would just admit it. No, we don't have reasonable financial aid, and yes, we're switching to ""need-aware"" aid for international applicants because Cornell can't afford to help international students. I've worked in different parts of the University and I've seen it firsthand.

What's really frustrating, though, is the fact that Cornell's alumni donate so much money: We're ~ #5 in the world, in terms of alumni donations. Yes, much of that money is earmarked so alumni can stick their names on things before they die. But our Cornell can't manage the endowment, either. 

In fiscal year 2015 Cornell's return-on-investment was 3.5%. It was the lowest in the Ivy League (highest, Princeton, 12.7%, closest, Brown, 5.7%). The median return for other Ivy League schools was 8.4%. 

Cornell has the most students, the most alumni, and some of the best programs in the world in their respective fields. Yet we have the third-smallest endowment, and the worst performing. Even if FY 2015 was an outlier, the fact remains that Cornell can barely make ends meet - We can't even afford chairs for Klarman Hall."
