I saw you around Becker all the time, even before we met briefly. You are beautiful, and maybe the smiles and your enthusiasm whenever we saw each other meant something, but maybe not. I Just didn't want you to think I'd been ignoring the signs; I simply don't trust my own ability to read them anymore. My fault, not yours. Maybe next year. :)
