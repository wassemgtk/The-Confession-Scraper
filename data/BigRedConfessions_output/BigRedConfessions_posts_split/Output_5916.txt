"Dear girl who finally let me buy her coffee after saying no before,

I was happy to see you and your new hair was awesome. But it seemed that you did let me get you coffee to rid me of your presence. you rushed off to your class... the class that starts at 2:55... at 2:30. in the same building as mine. 

If you didn't want to talk to me... then don't say hi and notice something about my picture on fb. Don't deceive that you'd like to talk to me. It hurts. "
