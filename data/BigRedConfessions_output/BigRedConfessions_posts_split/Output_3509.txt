Maybe I've had no luck with guys bc I'm not a Manic Pixie Dream Girl who's in love with faeries and unicorns. Maybe my INTJ personality shows through and guys recognize that and avoid me. Maybe it's bc I'm plain bordering ugly and still fat (but changing) whilst having the gall to be black on top of it. Maybe my standards are too fucking high. I don't know. It's weird bc I've never even wanted a boyfriend before. Ever. I had a (rather intense) crush freshman year, but that didn't pan out. I couldn't even talk to the guy bc I'm super shy and I was extremely unattractive. All of a sudden, though, as I'm taking some time off from Cornell, I have this urge to be with someone. But then I can't? I'm just undesirable and I have a feeling I'll be alone forever and truly become the cat lady I've always aspired to be. :/
