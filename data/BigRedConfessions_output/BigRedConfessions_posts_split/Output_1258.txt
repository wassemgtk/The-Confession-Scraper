I've recently taken a leave of absence from Cornell for mental health reasons, and I already feel like nothing's ever going to get better. I haven't spoken to anyone or left the house in days, and the only conversation I've had with a Cornell student since I left has been maybe 4 messages long.

But then again, the only alternative is going back to campus, where not only am I invisible, but I also am surrounded by Cornell students who are doing actual things with their lives.

Either way, I can't seem to imagine a future where I actually matter to someone, and I can't imagine a future worth sticking around for.
