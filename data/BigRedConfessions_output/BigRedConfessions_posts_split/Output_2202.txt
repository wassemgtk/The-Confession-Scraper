This is super random and I'm probably not going to find the guy. But to the really tall guy at slope day that whispered in my ear and said something along the lines of " oh you should be jumping more to the music". I was the girl with the kimono. I just want to say thank you. I don't feel like guys like me here, and although you probably were not flirting with me, I just want to say thanks for making it look like you were at least <3 ...I should've just kissed you and not given a fuck about it.
