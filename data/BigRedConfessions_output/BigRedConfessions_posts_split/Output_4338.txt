I live in a triple, and I just met one of my roommates this semester. She seemed nice at first, but after barely a week since meeting her, she started walking around our room pantless in her underwear. My other roommate and I have already asked her SUPER nicely to please wear pants at all times, but she still walk around pantless most times…she even walks to the bathroom on our floor pantless. Did I mention she sleeps nude too?! And sometimes without the blanket covering her?! I don't know what to do anymore…...
Literally think my roommate from China is a nudist or porn star. She always wants to be naked in my room. This is NOT okay. Like wtf. PUT YOUR CLOTHES ON.
