As someone who is depressed, with close friends who are also depressed, I am sorry. In the worst moments, it is really, really hard to love those who are depressed and/or suicidal.
THANK YOU, to everyone who takes the time to care about others, depressed or not. I hope your efforts do not go unappreciated.
