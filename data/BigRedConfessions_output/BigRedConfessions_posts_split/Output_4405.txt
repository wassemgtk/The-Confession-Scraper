Re: the confession trying to categorize the word "bitch" for some reason: I hate that word in general. It makes me feel disgusted and uncomfortable when someone says it or calls me it for any reason. It is a hateful word overall, and I want to run away when someone uses it. Don't try to make it quirky.
