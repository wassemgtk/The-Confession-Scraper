I fucked up. I fucked up big time. My friends were ragging on me two years back about how I never kissed a girl and have never even asked one out. I started joking with them that I was gay. For some reason, the "joke" got out of hand and somehow made it from my small circle of friends into the wider global community. So now everyone thinks I'm gay. It makes it so awkward to talk to a girl and she starts looking at me weirdly when I try flirting. One girl even just came right out and said it "Wait, I thought you were gay. Why are you hitting on me?" People are even encouraging me to go to LBGT meetings and guys are hitting on me left and right. I've got nothing against gay people, but holy fuck, how can one joke get so out of hand??? So now I've effectively come out of the closet when I was never in the fucking closet to begin with and I'm still a virgin! Part of me just wants to accept what's been done and find a nice gay guy and settle down. At least then I'll have that V-card taken care of.
