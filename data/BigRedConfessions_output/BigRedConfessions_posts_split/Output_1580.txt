I haven't had confidence in my abilities or intelligence in a long time, so I thought I would start anew here at Cornell, try and muster up some self-esteem. Throughout high school, I was constantly pushed aside or looked down upon by my more successful peers. There was no one subject or area that I could excel at and call it my own talent. Even though I understand things are all relative, and that I shouldn't care about what others think, but today just completely proved that no matter what I do people will still think lowly of me.

This week, when we got back our prelims, I was just average on the curve, nothing good or bad I think. But then today, when I was struggling with some homework, I think my friends got fed up me, and then they just started calling me things like retard and dumbass. Although, I shouldn't be let down by people or name-calling like this, I still feel that no matter how hard I try, what I do, or where I go, there is no escape from being viewed like a pathetic pile of crap. It's just too easy for me to lose faith in my skills these days, and there is no way back up.
