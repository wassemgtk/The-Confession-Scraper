I piss my liberal friends the most after I graduated from Cornell several years ago. I never show off, but I noticed I started losing a lot of liberal Facebook friends after people find out about my success. It seems they are just jealous and it's quite common with leftists. After Cornell, I realized how to pay the least taxes by living in a state where there is no income tax. I also live in a state where I can own any firearms I want, including full auto machine guns, and I can even conceal carry to protect my family and friends. I work on capital projects and made a six figure salary right out of college ($123,000 a year to be exact). I now make $135,000 plus bonuses and company benefits. I invest that money and make 3-4 times my salary. I own a nice Corvette, an H3, and a Hellcat. I own nice shoes that I polish myself, since I cannot trust anyone to shine my own shoes. I belong to a beautiful country club and have many nice conservative friends who would do anything for me. I isolate myself from idiots and the majority of people I consider to be the "lowest common denominator." I have a nice girl friend who's getting married with me soon and I just put a down payment on a new house with 50 acres of land, a nice salt water swimming pool and cedar sauna and hot tub. I am living the American Dream and yeah my house is surrounded by a nice tall iron wrought fence with spikes on the top to keep the riff raff away from my house and property. Thank you Cornell for starting me up on the route of success. It pays off to work hard, stay determined, and to believe in the power of capitalism. If you don't quit and have perseverance, you will never be a loser. One day capitalism will reward you too if you stay true to yourself!
