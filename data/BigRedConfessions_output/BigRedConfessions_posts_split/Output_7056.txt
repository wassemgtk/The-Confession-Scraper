"I hate having to hold in the fact that I care. I am intense, emotional, and passionate. It's been a while but I still feel these things bubbling up inside of me. I want to just go up to you and talk about why things didn't work out; I just want to know. But I know it'll seem weird if I do. I'm supposed to act like I don't care, not texting, not calling, only occasionally saying hi. If I show I care, then I lose. What exactly? My pride, I guess, my dignity. Definitely the game. Who gives a shit about pride though? We lose anyway when we don't do what we want. It's not that I'm scared; I'm sure you couldn't give me a real reason anyway, I would approach you but I don't think it's going to be worth losing my pride. It's just going to suck either way. I wish I could just take things as they are; you're clearly not into me anymore otherwise you wouldn't have given up. You never have to guess whether a guy is into you. You'll know. But I can't accept defeat. I just can't give on any aspect of my life....
I could go through all this effort and a few things could happen
1) You could say sorry not into it
2) You could be all for trying again until a) my intense side scares you off b) I remember the reason I pushed you away in the first place- we're opposites, and not necessarily in a complementary way

So what is worth the fight anymore? And why don't people fight for anything anymore? And why do I care so much?
