American black people tend to be by far the most racist people that I know. Indians and East Asians are tied for a relatively distant second - they're more exclusionary than outright bigoted. Whites, Hispanics, and non-American Blacks are all along the spectrum of racism - these are too geographically diverse groups to make an adequate stereotype out of.

And me? I'm pretty racist, too. It takes one to know one, apparently.
