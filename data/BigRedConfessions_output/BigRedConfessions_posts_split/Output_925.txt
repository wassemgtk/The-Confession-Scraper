Going back to my comment about building the people mover system at Cornell, I decided to scrap my plans and instead invest in more extensive people mover systems at Cornell since it comes to my attention with all the latest market research I have done that students at Cornell would be too cheap to pay $2.75 per month or $150 a month in order to justify building my system. I simply would not get enough students to pay in order to make a profit, unless of course I could get the university to subsidize the rides instead of subsidizing the disgusting TCAT buses.
