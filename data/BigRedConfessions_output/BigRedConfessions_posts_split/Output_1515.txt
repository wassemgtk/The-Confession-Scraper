I GIVE UP. DONE WITH CORNELL. GONNA GO FILL OUT A DROP OUT FORM TOMORROW AT THE AG SCHOOL. EVERY EXAM I GET IS LOWER THAN A 65 AND THIS IS ONLY MY FIRST SEMESTER. I HAD THE BEAR, AND THE BORING UPSTATE NY COUNTRYSIDE. I'M TRANSFERRING BACK TO A COMMUNITY COLLEGE OR CCNY, EVEN THOUGH I WILL BE BACK WITH MEDIOCRE STUDENTS AGAIN IN NYC. AT LEAST THERE I WILL GET BETTER GRADES! THERE YOU HAVE IT I GOT OUT OF MY MIND WHAT I WANTED TO SCREAM OUT IN CLASS BUT WAS AFRAID THAT I WOULD GET CONFINED TO A MENTAL HOSPITAL FOR HAVING A MENTAL BREAKDOWN!
