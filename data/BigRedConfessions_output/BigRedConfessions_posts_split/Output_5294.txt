Maybe it isn't quite fair to say, but it wasn't really me who fucked everything up. I've lost my sense of self to this disease - that, at least, I am sure of. Some people destroy others, some people destroy themselves. I honestly don't know which feels worse, anymore, but at least you're all okay. I don't dare plague anyone else with the consequences of the mess that's perpetually dragging me down.
