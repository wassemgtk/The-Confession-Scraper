Why do we take two tests that determine the majority of our grade? Why do we take these tests in chairs that seem to be made for children? Why does anyone think that sitting down trying to answer questions for 2 1/2 hours straight is a good measure of being able to solve problems? Why do tests cover material that was only mentioned in class -- you aren't supposed to "teach" on a final exam, thats what the entire semester was dedicated to.
