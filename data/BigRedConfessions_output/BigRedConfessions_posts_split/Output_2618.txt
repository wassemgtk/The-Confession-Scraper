Let me preface this with two facts: 1) I am a gay man. 2) I have no problem with attractive women.

Now for my admittedly hypocritical rant, which will almost certainly draw the ire of internet warriors. 

I hate how attractive women seem to think every man they see must be attracted to them. I can almost see it in their eyes, like they're just waiting for me to try and talk to them. Unfortunately, I love people and try to be kind and nice anywhere I go, so I probably will talk to them. Apparently I don't look gay because they almost always take on the persona of "standoffish attractive women trying to dismiss desperate love-struck boy."

Ladies: I LIKE MEN. I don't care about you. And, quite frankly, I'm sure there are a lot of straight men who don't care about you either. For example, there are a lot of attractive men in the gay male community. But if they open their mouths and ignorance, superficiality, or trivial and uninteresting shit comes out, I automatically lose ALL attraction to them. So as far as those gorgeous attributes might take you, I'm willing to believe there are straight men who will immediately dismiss you if that's all you have. Your ego can be so infuriating that I sometimes consider going out of my way to make sure you know that I'm NOT attracted to you. But I'm too nice for all that.

Worst of all, sometimes attractive women seem like they want you to engage them. If I were straight, I'd consider this to be an incredibly sadistic and ill-advised game to play with someone's hopes or heart (though that's not to say that men can't demonstrate equal or greater cruelty.)

More broadly: Folks, you don't know everything about a person by just looking at them, OK? You just don't. Stop thinking you do and hope people surprise you. Because whether its sexuality, race, religion, gender, or any number of other things, assumptions will almost never lead you down a righteous path.
 
Alright, I'm done.
