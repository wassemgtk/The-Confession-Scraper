"Dear Travis Dandro, author of Mr. Gnu in the Cornell Daily Sun,

(no need to black that name out he's a public figure...but if you do please leave in that it's the guy that writes Mr. Gnu)

Your comic strip, Mr. Gnu, is possibly the least funny thing ever. It is aggressively unfunny. I have never once heard anyone express a positive, or even neutral, opinion about it. You might someday be capable of drawing funny comics, but the way you are currently doing it is destined for eternal failure. Please either attempt to improve Mr. Gnu or stop plaguing the Sun with your unbelievably terrible efforts.

Sincerely, literally everyone on campus"
