Hopefully I pass and graduate, since I feel like a worthless loser leech sucking my parents dry for tuition, and room and board while doing bad in my classes this last semester. :/ I don't know what to do since I failed my first prelim with a score under 50 in two classes, because I am having a hard time with life stressing out over finding a job and drinking a lot. I'm such a waste of my parents money and I don't know what I will tell them come December and I don't graduate like everyone else. :(
