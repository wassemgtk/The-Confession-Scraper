I had this fantasy when I was 9 that we could live in a society where everyone would walk around naked and you could just make eye contact with whomever you wanted and if they made the appropriate eye contact back, you could just immediately start having sex. It's funny b/c I hadn't thought about it in years and yesterday it randomly popped in my head while I was masturbating. An spin-off of the fantasy I thought of when I was 10, is that you would somehow accrue a score or a rating, and a person with a lower rating could not say no to a person with a higher rating. I was a sexually frustrated kid.
