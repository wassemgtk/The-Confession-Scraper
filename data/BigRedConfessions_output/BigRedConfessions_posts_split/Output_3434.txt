She makes me the happiest man alive. I love her so dearly and I trust her with all my life. I would honestly do anything for her. The sad part is that this semester she can't be here with me. I really miss her so much. I feel like a piece of me left when she left. I don't feel as alive as I do when I am with her. From day one, she was always able kindle my love with her smile and beauty, but its just a small flame that yearns for her warmth. It's just scary that she has this hold on me. I am afraid it will end one day and I wouldn't know how to get back from it. I promise to do everything I can to make sure it doesn't happen and prove you wrong. Just remember, I will always be yours. You are my always and forever. You, only you, complete me.
