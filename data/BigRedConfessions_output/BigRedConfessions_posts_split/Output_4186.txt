This is the first time I have had a major thing for a guy and he probably doesn't even know I exist. The only thing I look forward to every week is seeing him in class every Tuesday and Thursday. I love his sense of humour and I just feel so madly attracted to him. I wish I could tell him how I feel or that he felt the same at least a bit. I know there can never be anything between us. I just hope the year doesn't go by with me remaining invisible to him. I would love to get to know him better and spend time with him before we go our separate ways. I keep checking his Facebook page and somehow imagine maybe he looks at mine sometimes. Maybe it's just the notion of a little excitement in my life that doesn't let me get over him. Maybe we can just be visitors in each other's lives for a while.....
