I can't believe my professors are allowed to hold on to tests (after we are allowed to glance at our grade). The only possible reason a professor wouldn't allow students to keep tests is that he or she reuses the exam. I's lazy, disrespectful (you can't even be bothered to do a key part of your job?), encourages cheating, and hurts students. The purpose of an exam is to allow students to demonstrate what they know, and to help in assigning grades. Practical feedback on what students do and do not know or understand is crucial when huge percentages of our final grades (60,70,80+) is on the line. I've had to go into finals blind, without being able to study any of my prelims and without a single piece of feedback. Your job is to teach. Don't hurt our education, our grades and our futures.
