"Here's what I did when I was 18. I bought an airline ticket to New York City. I went to the airport. They told me my suitcase was over the weight limit and I had to pay an extra $20 to get it on board. I did not have $20. So my solution was this - I removed the single heaviest object from my ginormous suitcase - which was a DESKTOP - that's right - a DESKTOP computer tower. I removed a bunch of heavy clothes too. I asked for a box. I put the computer and the clothes in said box and I asked them if they could hold on to it for me; that I would call my friend and have him drive by and pick up the box. I would do this once I arrived in New York, because I did not have a cell phone at the time, nor change to use a payphone.

They were 1) shocked that I didn't have $20 or a credit/debit card that could be charged $20 2) that I could not call anyone to ask for money or help in general 3) that I pulled a DESKTOP computer out of my suitcase and 4) that I asked them to do this, which I could tell was the first time anyone had made such a request. But they said okay. I arrived in New York. I called my friend. He said he would drive by. He did the next day and he told me he couldn't get it. So I lost my $1000 computer, with a 500 GB HDD full of my life and a bunch of other things too in the single weirdest and dumbest possible way. This happened in 2006.

I've since graduated from Cornell, accomplished a fair amount and, and I am currently rather successful by most standards. And I am a few orders of magnitude smarter than I was then, by any measure. What is my point - you are going to do a lot of stupid things when you are 18. Don't think too much of them, don't read into them, don't try to figure out what went wrong and how you should fix it. You will do dumb things as a teenager and into your early 20s. A lot of them will involve people of the opposite sex. But it gets better. It gets much better. If you're intelligent, work hard, and have good intentions, amazing things will happen!"
