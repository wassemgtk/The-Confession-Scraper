I'm graduating soon and I feel so lonely and like a worthless piece of crap. I don't even know what to do. I am crying a lot lately and don't even have anyone to ask for help because I feel like I have been ignored by everyone in the past. If I slipped away no one would even notice because I am insignificant.
