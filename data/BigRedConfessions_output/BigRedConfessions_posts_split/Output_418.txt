"There was a brown-skinned girl standing at the bus stop across from Uris today, and her face was turned up, her eyes were closed, and she was smiling a little when the sun hit her (can't blame you...sunlight in February in Ithaca is unheard of). And the wind was blowing her hair around, and she seemed really happy just standing there waiting for the bus. 
If you're reading this, I thought you were really pretty. And I wish I could be as peaceful as you seemed to be. I tried to follow your example and at least take a moment to appreciate this weather, but there's just too much shit going on in my life right now. "
