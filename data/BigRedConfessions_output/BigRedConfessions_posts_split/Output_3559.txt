I'm considering something I call "Operation Bad Dream"-- it's where I never come back to Cornell and never speak to anyone here again, effectively treating the last two and a half years like one long, bad dream. All those rejections and failures and those awful things my "friends" have said and done to me over the years would have never actually happened. If anyone cared, they'd probably start treating me like a human being. Who knows where I will end up! As long as it's not here...
