"So moving-in day Freshmen year, I took a bus alone to Cornell to move in. I remember the bus ride being so nerve-racking, I was wondering what life would be like for the next four years and if I would even have any close friends. So once I got to the Ithaca bus terminal downtown, I took a cab to campus. I ended up sharing the cab with some other students returning/moving-in on the way up, and I remember one of them was an older student. I think she could tell I was nervous and that everything looked so new still. I mean to be fair I was gawking at the scenery already. She asked if I was a freshman and some other small talk. 

The thing that really stuck out to me though, was that she made the effort to give me her number and said that I could text her if I ever wanted to hang out or needed someone to talk to. I don't know why but that surprised me so much, she really had no obligation to help out the nervous freshman. It gave me such a great first impression of Cornell. Just wanted to share."
