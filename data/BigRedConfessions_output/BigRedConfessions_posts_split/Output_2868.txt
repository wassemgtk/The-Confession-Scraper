Back in High School I felt like a total rock star. Despite being a kind of quiet guy, I was the epicenter of my friend group. People became friends because they were [first] friends with me. Everyone knew my name, and in terms of girls, it was usually just a matter of which one to turn down for the other. It was socializing time, all the time.  

Fast forward to Cornell: I can’t ever find time to hang out with the few friends I have, and I sometimes go days without seeing or talking to a human being at Cornell. My close high school friends are all at other colleges with countless friends and weekend plans, going about it with their significant others and fantastic grades. “It seems like you never have time for anything, Cornell sounds like a s**thole,” said one of those friends this past weekend. “You’re telling me to take a break from doing homework? That’s weird coming from the guy that hardly ever stops,” said another.

Engineering, I blame you for all of this.
