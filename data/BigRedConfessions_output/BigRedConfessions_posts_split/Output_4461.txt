I'm Christian, and my Christian friends irritate me. People who practice other religions don't bring up their religion in everyday conversation nearly as much as my Christian friends do. I like to be able to have a conversation without hearing how something "is a sign of God working in our lives". I mean seriously. Your faith doesn't need to be announced every five minutes for it to be real. Silent (or quiet) faith works too.
