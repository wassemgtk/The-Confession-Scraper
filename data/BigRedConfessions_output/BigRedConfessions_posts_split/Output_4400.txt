I have never felt so alone in my life as I do hear. I am not a part of anything and seem to dwell solely in my own head. I see happiness and joy in the faces of my peers but it just seams to evade my grasp ever so slightly. My friends are thousands of miles away. I see their giddy facebook posts and smiling pictures. And occasionally one will send me a text: "How's Cornell?". How am I to respond? They want a yes, they want to know I'm okay and move onto whatever interesting stories currently rivet their lives. I cannot bare to tell them how miserable I am, how deeply sad that tears won't even dare to flow. Alone. Sorrounded by people.
