I love my boyfriend. My friends keep telling me that they can tell that my boyfriend loves me, but he has never said it, so I have to disagree. Next year is going to be hard with applications,  research, school work, and his interesting apartment situation. I can't help but wonder if I should break up with him and take that pain before he really hurts me emotionally.
