I've been seeing all of these posts about fighting back against sexual assault recently, and I just want to make one thing very clear to everyone: Cornell does not care about rape or its victims. It cares about one thing and one thing only: not getting sued.

Sure, individuals might care-- counselors, professors, etc. But the university itself could care less about anything other than lawsuits or negative publicity. It is run by self-serving jerks and idiotic bureaucrats. Otherwise, they would crack down on the frats and this would be less of a problem.

Same with mental health. They claim to care about depression, but newsflash: They don't. Kind of sucks to pay 50 k a year to attend this place, doesn't it?

Oh, and don't get me started on the police department. They are complete imbeciles who were barely able to catch a couple of teenage paintballers and have neither the intellect nor dedication to actually accomplish anything significant.
