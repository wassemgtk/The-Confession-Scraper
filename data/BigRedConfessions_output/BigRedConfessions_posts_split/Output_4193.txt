I confess to being the kind of woman who will drop everything for her man, regardless of how much it'll cost me later on. I put my partner ahead of my school work and other obligations and it makes me sick! I pay too much money to go to this school and worked my ass off for a long time to get here- why am I letting losers (who lack respect more often than not and do not know how to treat a lady properly) distract me from what's important?! My career goals and aspirations are too big and too important for me to be distracted by the "all mighty power" of the D. I need to shake it off and hit the books harder than the sheets GOD DAMMIT *end rant*
