I have a huge problem. My girlfriend of 3 months had decided to get intimate with me just a few days back. The problem lies in the physical size disparity. She is MUCH shorter than me (her head only reaches to about my chest level). So the other day we were making love and I could tell she was faking it. SHE WAS TOTALLY FAKING IT. I know because the sounds she was making was of someone in pain, not those of someone experiencing sweet pleasure. Shortly after the nasty deed was done, she made up some excuse and hurriedly scurried out the door half-limping and half sprinting with a very noticeable thigh gap. I feel horrible. I honestly think she's going to break up with me because my dick is too big. We haven't talked to each other since..
