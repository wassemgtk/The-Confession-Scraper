Recently there's been a lot of fuss over the Student Assembly's refusal to vote on Cornell's investment in Israeli corporations.  I personally think the whole idea is stupid.  Everyone forgets that Cornell is not an individual person, but rather a conglomeration of diverse people.  The Student Assembly's decision to avoid voting in favor of either side was the only reasonable option, the only choice that represented the idea of Cornell as a group of people.  There Cornell students that fall on both sides of the Palestine-Israeli conflict, and I for one appreciate that the Student Assembly recognized that.
