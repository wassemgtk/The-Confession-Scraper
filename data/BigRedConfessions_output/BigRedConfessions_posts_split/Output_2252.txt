I have no idea why I came here. Almost all the people I knew that were vastly inferior to me academically went to state or local schools. They all graduated college with high GPA's and got accepted into high paying jobs into the six figures. I know I'm not entitled to anything just because of my school's name. But it irks me to no end when an idiot high school bully will probably end up doing better than me. I hate my life.
