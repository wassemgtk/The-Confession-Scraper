I'm sorry for spending too much time in the lab and not listening to your problems with me and making amends. You know I am trying to be the best I can because you know my friend died back in middle school, and I'm trying to honor him by maximizing my productivity in terms of trying to bring change to the world. I told you when we first met during the first week of freshman year that I'm gonna try and be the best and push myself  to the furthest extent that I couldn't even imagine. I told you that if I ever deviated from that goal, I needed you to tell me to get back on track and continue pushing until my friend's death was fully honored. 

However, I failed to listen to your problems with me and our friendship had soured because of my selfishness to do lab work and not balancing that life with your own. I'm sorry I had put you second. I'm sorry that you were pushed away. I'm sorry even for the fact that you met me because you had a protected childhood, and it's not right for me to expect you to fully understand my feelings and perspectives. And I'm sorry for "making you push your friends away" after you and your friends made fun of me. And I forgave you soon after your insensitive behaviors too. Like, I enjoy talking to you and don't hold your ignorance against you as I believe you will learn. There is just a communication gap between us, and ignoring the problem won't help. I had tried to hit the reset button several times, but you just ended up crying anyways. And I know you tried to explain to me what your problems were, but I still don't understand. But I WANT to understand them. So, why can't we make tangible changes and reconcile for the better?

Or should I just do what you and everyone else told me to do and move on? I'm still not over my friend's death, so how can you expect me to move on past your leave of absence? I mean, moving on feels like betraying a conviction. If I have a feeling, I follow it 110%, and my feeling is that you are someone I care about and want to be involved in your life because I can never forget the boldness of your laugh. When you laugh with your friends without me, I smile so much, and have a slight ache that I'm not the one who can make you laugh. Well, you never found me funny anyways. Maybe it is all for the better. Point is, I'm sticking to my conviction for you as that is what makes me genuinely, deeply happy. Whatever you choose that makes you genuinely, deeply happy will make me genuinely and deeply happy. But I'm still sticking to that conviction.
