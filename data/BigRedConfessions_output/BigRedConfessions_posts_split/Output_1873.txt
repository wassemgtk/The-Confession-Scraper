Dear frat-star,

You're in one of the best/well-known fraternities on-campus and your pictures are always filled with attractive people. But freshman year, you drunkenly came up to me and asked me how I was doing. I was wearing a sweater on a Saturday night and I was definitely not the type of girl you were into, so I didn't know why you even acknowledged me. You talked about how you talked your friend out of suicide once and that you would always be open if I ever needed anybody to talk to. You were laughing, but I could tell you really meant that and had a good heart. Maybe you saw a bit of sadness in me. We joked about writing an essay due tomorrow and you left with a friend.

I'll always remember your intellectual comments in our FWS and how slightly shy and friendly you were in class. You gained a lot of confidence since then. I hope you didn't lose that good in you to the fraternity culture or life at Cornell.
