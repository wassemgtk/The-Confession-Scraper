"My reflection", he calls me. And though I've recently tried to distance myself, with every passing day it is reinforced that he is the one. He must be because no matter who I talk to, or who I kiss it is simply not the same. 

I'm sorry if these recent actions of mine cause you pain. I just hope that you know that I've loved you, perhaps before I even met you. Everything I go through serves a purpose, to help teach me what it is that I should have in this lifetime. Although we have doubts about the future-you were always the one to tell me that fearing and doubting are the two greatest evils. I want you to listen to your heart and mine when I say all of this. I just want you to recall it all. Each and every second of us---even those we've spent away. I want you to do this because I want you to fight for us, to make it happen. That's all I'd been trying to do---but now that I've eased off of it I realize my life is empty without the drive of keeping you, fighting for every ounce of your love. 

It's you, it's you, it's all for you.
