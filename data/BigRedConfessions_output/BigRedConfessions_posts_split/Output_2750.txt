My little brother (16 years old at the time) wanted to be a real life superhero. He dressed up in this weird outfit made out of spandex and leather. His weapons were: pepper spray, one of my dad's expensive belts, and a tazer. He even went out at night to patrol the streets of the Upper East Side at night. He spent most of his time just brooding alone in his bedroom, reading comics and listening to Fox News for local crime at night. My parents were really getting weirded out by his antisocial behavior, so they told me to do something about it. When I went home for the summer, me and a few of my buds followed him creeping around the neighborhood. We dressed up as the Joker, the Penguin, and Lex Luthor and beat the shit out of him. 
He finally cut that shit out of his life and took up an interest in programming instead. He just got accepted into MIT. 
Moral of the story kiddos: Don't be a fucking idiot and dress up as Batman to protect your city at night. Do something worthwhile. Like science. Or read a fucking book. Idiots.
