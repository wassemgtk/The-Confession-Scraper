I think you're really awesome person to talk to, and would love to ask you out although we only talked once. In fact, my friend really wants me to date you because we both are busy people, and it was our busy schedules that our previous partners couldn't cope with. But I don't wanna ask you out because we are in the same classes and it'd suck if it doesn't work out. Moreover, you're more outgoing than I am, so I'd only bring you down. Still, I'm looking forward to interacting with you in the rest of the years here at Cornell...
