I used to have a friend at Cornell, but the friendship didn't last more than a few months. My friend had mental issues and I was trying to help them with finding the right path, but unfortunately they always wanted it their way even though they were wrong most of the time. But time reveals the truth and more and more the things we debated on are proving accurate. The recent shooting, which actually happened near my former friend's hometown, actually proved I was right on the issues, and we need to fix a lot of the issues our country has rather than be passive and hope for the best....that will get us down the wrong path. :( I hope one day they can come to the realization that I was only trying to help them, make sure they were safe..........Maybe they will never realize it and it saddens me everyday that sometimes you cannot help people.
