I'm lonely and I want to be in a relationship. I'm a really strong minded, independent girl and I'm aware that I don't need a guy to make me happy. That said, I've just never felt comfortable with casual hookups and I have needs that I want to be fulfilled. I know everyone's super busy and stressed here (so am I) but I wish I could find a guy that wants to be in a relationship. Yes, relationships take time and effort but I feel that if two people are on the same page they can live their own lives working on meeting their goals and still be together. So not having time is just a bullshit excuse. I am not without flaws, but I am pretty, smart, down to earth; I know what I have to offer and I don't understand why on this big, huge campus, this big, huge earth, I or anyone else should be lonely.
