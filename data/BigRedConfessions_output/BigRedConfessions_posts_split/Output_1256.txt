This is in response to the couple previous post about STEM major writing off non-STEM majors.

I'm a STEM major. I know the world needs all kinds of professionals - engineers, lawyers, hotel administrators, writers, therapists, etc. But at the same time, its frustrating when I see my friends in A&S/CALS/HumEc spending a couple hours a day in class, a couple hours on HW, and then having buckets of free time to hang out or do fun things. I feel like I never have free time. 

I am taking 20 credits this term. My flowchart has me taking 19 credits/term as an upperclassman. My flowchart. as in the minimum requirements to graduate. My friends in other schools are averaging around 14. They have to petition take 18. I have to take 19 just to graduate. Thats not even considered the fact that all credits are not equal...

I know that I choose my major. I know that all of the majors and careers are equally needed. But, yes. I am bitter that the workload is so uneven. This is what leads me to "look down on" other majors (which I am not proud of). It is something I am working on, it is something a lot of us need to work on. But at the same time, I hope non-STEM people can see where this is coming from.
