#6511 If you're who I think you are, then you're referring to me. I'm as sick of this is as you seem to be of being reminded of it. I'm glad you don't think about me anymore, and honestly something in me believes that. I don't know, maybe it's your sense of humor regarding the whole mess.Still, I'm guessing that running into me is really messing with your head, which is why you apparently keep turning to confessions to cope. I'm not even mad anymore really, though I don't know why you think I need to "get over myself." But, considering our history, you saying that is the least of your transgressions lol. I'm not mad about that either.

Anyway, you're right on both accounts: What you did was dumb. But this is also a dumb thing to stress out about. Let's just deal with it. The next time you see me, I'll stop walking. If your confession was about me and mine is about the person I think it's about, then you'll know and you'll stop too, I hope. I'm sure a brief convo will end this. Then you really will be free of all thought about me, even when you see me. And I can stop dreading seeing you too. Hoping you'll think much longer and harder about these decisions from now on, though I think you've already started.
