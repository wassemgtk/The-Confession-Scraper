I think I am falling in love with a married man. His marriage was pretty much over before I even met him but I am trying so hard not to fall in love because I know he won't actually divorce his wife and I have no chance with him. Him flirting with me and having a wide smile everytime he sees me or talks to me doesn't help at all.
