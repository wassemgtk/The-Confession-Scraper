The reason why I am so intense and achievement-oriented sometimes is because I am lonely. I figure that if I can't ever have a relationship, well then I might as well improve on myself. Good idea right? Too bad there is little to reach for anymore, and the more awards, and accolades I get the more separated I feel, and the more I can't let people down. Catch-22
