I wish I had never come to Cornell. I came with dreams of becoming a doctor, but then I started failing classes. Graduated with a 2.2 gpa, and now I'll never have any chance of getting accepted to medical schools. Now I'm still unemployed, and I can't help but wonder if my life would have been better if I had gone to an easier school.
