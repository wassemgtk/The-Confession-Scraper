I had no idea that I could HATE someone this much! Dude, you are the most despicable roommate ever. I hate how much I hate you because it is causing me to have such negative thoughts,  which I try to avoid. I hope after this semester I'll never see you on campus again. And, even if I do, don't say shit to me, bitch!
