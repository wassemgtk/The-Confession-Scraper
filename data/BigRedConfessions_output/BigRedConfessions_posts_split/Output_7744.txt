I know you've been going through something awful lately. You work so hard, but it's apparent that you're exhausted and that whatever you're dealing with is eating you up inside. I know you don't want to talk to most of us, but I think it could help you to know that we care, and we will listen if you need someone to talk to. I've been in similar places myself, and just knowing someone cared was like a little candle in the dark. It might seem small to someone who is in a good place, whose world is filled with light, but when dark is all you can see and feel, just a little light can seem like the sun. So I while I hope you can find your sun soon, I know it isn't likely, but we'd light a hundred thousand candles for you.
