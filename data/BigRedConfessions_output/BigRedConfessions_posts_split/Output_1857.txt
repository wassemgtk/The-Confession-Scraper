To the guy last fall in my discussion section: We had so much chemistry. We flirted all semester, but neither of us took it any further. 

I saw you waiting for me after section toward the end of the semester, and I knew you were going to ask me out, but I pretended that I didn't notice. 

I was totally into you, and I wanted to dive headfirst into wherever that was going. But I found out you were a senior, and that you were moving away in May. I wanted to remember you as the "one who got away" rather than "that shitty long-distance relationship that didn't even really begin until you left and fizzled out agonizingly slowly."

I know you're going to do well in med school.
