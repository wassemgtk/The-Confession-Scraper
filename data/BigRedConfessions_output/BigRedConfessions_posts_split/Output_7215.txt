You are like a positron - you have energy, you essentially have no mass as you are a petite gorgeous thing, and you are always positively charged. Let me be your antiproton. There aren't enough ions in the Universe, there isn't a temperature high enough, there isn't enough ordinary matter to ever break us apart. E = mc^2 won't apply to us. We'll break all the rules. We'll be the theory of everything that redefines love, the unification of great ideas that produces something truly beautiful. When I'm with you I understand how everything works. When we're not together I only see entropy. The total energy of the Universe is zero, because your beauty balances out the splendor of 400 billion galaxies. Please give me a chance.
