I need to cut my loses. My patience has run out. All the energy I had, has been wasted. I'm amazed, you carved a hole into something I thought was impenetrable. And then you destroyed it from the inside out. There is a crater that reminds me of what was once there, but that doesn't matter. I don't care. Maybe this is for the better, because I knew everything was spiraling down either way. This way I don't fall with it all. I followed it deep down, much farther than I would like to admit, but at least I still have enough strength to find my way back up. A few seconds out, these feelings were so intense, that ending it sounded so much more pleasing than losing it all. But I wasn't even given the choice. I didn't lose, I just don't care enough to hold it anymore. My sanity is returning. My power is returning. I will be a man once again. A man without you, but there is no reason to be one with you. You aren't worth it. You never were. I was clouded by a euphoria of your greatness, a greatness that I won't lie, still remains. But your flaws stabbed me, continuously, not until I couldn't stand it anymore, but until I finally decided to give in and walk away. No conceivable reason for me to stay. I learned my limits, even when it came to something as great as love. But these limitations, I do not want to push against. I will accept I am no god, just a mortal man. That I know matter how much I can conqueror, I can't take every single thing head on. Today my love for you died, my heart skipped a beat for the last time. That beautiful warmth was killed, by you, and I am happy you did it, since it is something I have wanted to do for a while now. Today I can be truly happy.
