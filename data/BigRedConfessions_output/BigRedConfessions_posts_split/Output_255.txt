Well, it looks like I'm stuck. First semester here as a transfer student (2nd Semester Sophomore) and after two months, I can tell this 'soft-skill' major type stuff is absolutely not what I expected to be learning about. I wasn't sure until now, but my last chance to transfer out of here (Harvard or Yale) seems to have been March 1st (as I'll be a Junior after this point). I can't even do an internal transfer into Dyson. 

Damn, this is going to be a ~lovely~ two more years.
