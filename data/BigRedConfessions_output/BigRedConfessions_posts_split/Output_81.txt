To #8023:

You are definitely not alone. There are plenty of normal people that choose to have sex only with people that they care about. I'm a (straight) guy, fairly social, fairly attractive (at least that's what yo momma said-jk jk!) and have received a decent amount of attention from the opposite sex, as well as a few advances from members of the same sex. I've had 1 one-night-stand (freshman year) and it sucked ass (no pun intended) and I felt incredibly dirty (in a bad way) afterwards. I never tried hooking up again. Multiple friends of mine have had similar experiences and the few that won't come out and decry the hook-up scene have still seen some shit. Oh and these guys aren't exactly the religious type either (I think most are either agnostic-atheist or irreligious) and they have pretty active social lives--student athletes, club leaders, student government positions, project teams, etc.

Luckily, I found a girl about a year and a half after the incident. She shares the same views on sex as me and we're planning on getting engaged after graduation. The conversation was pretty difficult to bring up; but at the appropriate time I made clear my views and hoped for the best. The point is, there are definitely a good amount of people who don't buy in to the whole hook-up culture--(guys and girls, straight and otherwise) and I don't think that they're all religious freaks either. 

For the record, while I don't judge or partake in slut-shaming individuals, I definitely agree that promiscuity is not a positive character trait. It's probably not a deal-breaker for me (after all the heart wants what it wants), but I always think twice before dating a girl who's...been around the neighborhood. It signifies that the individual doesn't value sex as an act of intimacy and love. Many people are able to separate the two--sex and love--or at least convince themselves that they have. But I don't think the two can be so easily uncoupled--at least, it can't for me and many of my friends. 

I hope you find your special someone fellow Cornellian. Just try to expand your horizons and look elsewhere rather than among a specific subset of the student populace that is notorious for one-night stands and risky behavior.
