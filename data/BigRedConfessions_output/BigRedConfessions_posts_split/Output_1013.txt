It has been one year since our break up and I honestly never thought I would be where I am today. I often think about the fact that I spent 1/6 of my life with you, which is crazy! I spent nights crying over you. I spent mornings crying over you. I even went to EARs and spent two hours crying to a stranger about how much I missed you. I haven't talked to you or seen you since that cold Friday night in November and at some point over the summer, I stopped wanting to see you or talk to you. I am so grateful for the year of lessons that this heartbreak has taught me. I have matured in ways that I never thought were possible and learned to step out of my comfort zone over and over again. When I was ready, I entered another romantic relationship. It didn't pan out the way I wanted to but our break up has taught me that life goes on. This time last year, I starved myself for two weeks and I contemplated jumping every other day. A year later, I am the happiest I have ever been in my life. Yes, I have bad days and things don't always go the way that I want them to, but I am happy and in love with my life and in love with all of my decisions. It's a wonderful feeling to think about how far I've come in just twelve months.
