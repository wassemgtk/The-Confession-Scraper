I have a friend. They are quiet yet outspoken, soft yet so strong, small yet so big in my eyes and I'm sure in the eyes of others. I didn't know what I wanted to do here at Cornell but it was essentially his/her diligence and passion that made me want to jump on board with them -- this is the major that now as an upperclassman I see myself devoting my life to. I don't know for sure how they feel about me but to the person whom I respect and care for, there will always be someone who holds you in high regards. Thank you for being you.
