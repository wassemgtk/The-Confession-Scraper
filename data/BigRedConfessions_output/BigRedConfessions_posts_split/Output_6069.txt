I'm like, purposely cold and unfriendly to my roommate, moreso than I've ever been to anyone on this campus. This is because the first few weeks after I moved in, she revealed herself as not only whiny, but kind of a bigot. I've never given 0 fucks about how I treated a person, so I find this so interesting...
