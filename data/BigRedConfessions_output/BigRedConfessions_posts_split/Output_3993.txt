Oh god.. I am so attracted to you, its driving me crazy. I crave your attention and would love to get to know you better. Your smile drives me crazy and every time our eyes meet, I feel like a 16 year old with butterflies in my stomach. I am not in love with you, I am just terribly attracted to you and I am going insane about not knowing whether you even remotely feel anything for me. I just hope that this either leads to something while it can or that I get over you as soon as possible. Being this way is making me impatient, restless and really distracted. I keep thinking of excuses to walk by your room just so I can catch a glimpse of you, hoping that if you see me, maybe you will give a sign. I check your FB profile a dozen times a day and stop myself from sending you a message, not sure if it would be appropriate because I have no clue how you feel. We both have our separate lives and I don't expect anything from you. I just want to know you and spend time with you while we are both here because I have a feeling what we could have will be really good. So if you are reading this and know who I am, give me a sign. There is only so much I can do without any initiative from you.
