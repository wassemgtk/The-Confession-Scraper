I finally let a guy kiss me. And I couldn't help thinking that I was doing it all wrong- because it didn't feel that great. He kept insisting that he's had absolutely no complaints before, but I don't know. I like him a lot and I would probably do it again, but I couldn't help feeling crappy after letting him kiss me and touch me. I sure hope it gets better.
