Just a reminder for all of the girls out there in STEM: having "self-confidence" is different from having a huge superiority complex and being an asshole (i.e. saying your major is better than others). I really don't think most guys think that this is a good quality, regardless of the boy's major. I get that you don't *just* say stupid stuff regarding this topic to impress guys (duh), but it's really not a desirable quality. You're turning a lot of people off. And not just guys either. Everyone outside your circle of huge egos and thinking you're better than everyone else really just sees you as an asshole.
