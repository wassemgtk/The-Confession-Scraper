Being unhappy and doing badly in classes at Cornell is knowing you're wasting TONS of your parents money and letting them down. All while being stuck because transferring to a state school is just further having wasted money and losing the reputation that comes with an ivy name, and the pride your parents felt from having a kid there. And, y'know. Bad grades just sort of means that you can't get in as a transfer to a similar tier school. Long story short, I wish I had gone to any of the other schools I was accepted to.
