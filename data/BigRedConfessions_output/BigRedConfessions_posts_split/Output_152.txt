To the beautiful girl who works at CTB who always has a braid and a white headband - I have always wanted to talk to you about more than the bagel I want, and it makes my heart leap when I walk in and see you behind the counter. I came in yesterday and heard you telling someone about your girlfriend, and I actually almost turned and walked out. You are so nice to me always, and to everyone, and your smile literally lights up the room. I didn't walk out though, I went up and talked to you, and even though I know now that you're in a relationship I want you to know that your kindness and your smile have brightened so many of my days here, and I hope you keep smiling at me. I hope your girlfriend knows how lucky she is.
