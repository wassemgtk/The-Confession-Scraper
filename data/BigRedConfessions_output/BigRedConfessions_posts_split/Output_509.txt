I love, love, love Beyonce's new video. Formation is gripping, vivid and simply gorgeous. I didn't like the lyrics much though, simply there were too many "bitches" and "hoes" in it. But, still it is a tremendous song and it has reaffirmed my faith in Queen Bey following the "Hymn for the weekend" debacle. That being said, is it cultural appropriation for non-black people to use terms like "slay" and "work it" in their speech or writing? As an aspiring, non-black POC poet, I am curious about how the word Slay should be used...
