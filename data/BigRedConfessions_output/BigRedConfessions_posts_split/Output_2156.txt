Why does Cornell keep asking me for money when they have a $7 billion endowment and I still have 90K in student loans. It honestly adds insult to injury a little. It's a private organization that charges an absurd amount for a product. The product is okay, but still it's not like it's a charity. Apple doesn't call me to ask for a donation because I spent $1200 on a laptop and it's a good computer. If anything I should be asking them for money. I'm poor, I qualify for charity. You made an insane amount of money off of me, maybe give some back? I can invest it in a family rather than redo the roof of some building for the 3rd time in the last 5 years.
