A couple of recent confessions were about guys feeling bad about the size of their sexual organs. Just as a reminder, another expression for sex is "to make love". The physical aspect is just one of the sides of a good intercourse in a relationship, the other important factors are emotion, kindness, unselfishness, being concerned of your partner, mutual understanding and many other things. If you think you have imperfection in the physical aspect just work on other aspects. And of course, stop comparing yourself with actors in porn, not all the males in a good healthy relationship have penises equal to the size of a baseball bat.
