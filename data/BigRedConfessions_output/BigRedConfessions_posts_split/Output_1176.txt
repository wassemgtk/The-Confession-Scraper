It sounds as if this person considers you to be a booty call, but only when it's convenient for him/her and forget about your schedule/time/priorities. Putting out  messages like this and saying "I would like to see you again, one more time, for old times' sake" is really just setting you up for the same, as your "old times sake" was just hooking up. Was it THAT good that you're putting yourself out there like this for one last romp? I kind of doubt it. I'm sure a gal/guy like you can do better. If he/she does send you a text, do yourself a favor and ignore it anyway.
