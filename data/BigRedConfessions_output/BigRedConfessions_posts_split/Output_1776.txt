I am 99 percent sure that I was dating a sociopath. Just textbook relationship. I didn't just Google this, I used to study social disorders and I remember throughout the relationship feeling uncomfortable because it crossed my mind a few times. He probably thinks I'm angry at him because of all the things he put me though in the relationship, but honestly I just feel really sad for him and I hope he gets help (regardless if he's actually sociopathic).
