You're so annoying to me at work, but whenever you tease me, I can't help but smile and get these crazy butterflies in my stomach. I don't know why I am feeling this way, considering I am leaving next semester, but I want to let you know that I did have a little crush on you, totally unexpectedly. Even though the amount of time that I knew you was short, I would like to let you know that you were a great friend of mine, and I wish you nothing but the best in life.
