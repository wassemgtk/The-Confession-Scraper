I'm alienating my last two "friends" here.  Friends.  Yeah right.  One admitted that we have little in common.  If we were not in the same suite last year, we would never have had reason to talk to each other.  Nor would we much tolerate each other, I think.  The other...she only talked to me because she pitied me.  Well, fuck em.  Don't need no pity.  Soon this semester will end and I'll go back home.  At least I can be depressed and alone without having to see other people enjoying their time here.  Or at least people who don't go to bed each night trying to figure out the best method of suicide.  Fuck those people.  Fuck me for coming here.  No point in even thinking about transferring.  Broken as I am, nowhere and nothing can really improve my state of mind.
