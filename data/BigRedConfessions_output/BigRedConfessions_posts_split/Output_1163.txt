Anyone who watched the Yale students surround and berate Nicholas Christakis see the students throwing things similar to temper tantrums? "When it hurts ME! It's all about ME!". Especially that girl who screamed obscenities at him at the end (ironically she was part of the committee that hired him!); that was disgusting and despicable. I think the Mizzouri U students deserve commendations for what they did to combat racism and systematic ignorance of their problems for so long, but I think the Yale students are being little privileged dickwads who can't stand anything unpleasant at all. People really have double standards when it comes to racism, because it seems okay to many of the activists to call the black students who don't really agree with them "Uncle Toms". Why is that okay?

And spitting, jeering, and harassing the students who attended the Free Speech panel over at Yale...my god.

The sad thing is, I'm posting this on confessions because I feel like if I posted my opinions elsewhere, I'd be blasted by people trying to deride me with strawman attacks, ad hominem attacks, or otherwise just sarcastic and patronizing comments. Instead of someone considering an opposing viewpoint calmly, rationally, and if they thought I was wrong explaining it to me in a non-patronizing non-derisive manner. Too many people I know get off on insulting people with beliefs that aren't 100% progressive, and it rattles my soul.

I'm a racial minority (asian specifically) who grew up without a green card or citizenship in the US on borderline poverty level family income up until I was halfway through high school, so I really hope I don't get ad hominem'd with "check your privilege". I experienced racism and I hate it just as much as anyone else. But a white girl wearing a Mulan costume for halloween? I feel like you have to be REALLY sensitive to find that offensive
