My girlfriend told me she loved me after only knowing her for a month, after two months she drunkenly asked me if I could see us getting married and having kids? We've now been going out 6 months and I can't figure out how to break up with her without devastating her. She breaks down crying from thins that happened to her 10 years ago so I don't know how she'll react to this
