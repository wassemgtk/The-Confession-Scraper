The truth is even though I hooked up with other guys and spent the last 2 days crying when the guy I went out on a date with didn't get in contact with me, I still think about you all the time. We were together not even officially so briefly in the beginning of the year but you were some of my firsts. You acted like a douche; I know you're bad for me and you barely cared about me. But part of me just wants to say screw it; I'm here for 3 more days and I want to be with you one more time. It's so crazy and I hate myself for even thinking it, for even acknowledging it or wishing for it after so much time has passed and so much crap I took from you. But I know better and I know more and the problems I brought to what we had are less relevant. It would be crazy and I don't know how I could look at myself after but part of me wants to... then the other part says you might develop some stupid expectations or see it for more than it is. I know we could never be together, but part of me still wants something from you. It's crazy. We've had numerous talks and opportunities for me to get closure. Calling you up would be totally unlike me and what I stand for...heart vs. mind. This is so irrational.
