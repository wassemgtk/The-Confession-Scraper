"(note to admin: feel free to ignore it or not, but it is an interesting phenomenon that does happen on society)

Aside from all the cursing and weird stuff, it is obvious that racism is a two way street; yet there are people who said ""racism against white people"" doesnt exist. very very interesting video. 

[I'm not sure you can overextend colourism in Mexico to "racism against white people" in general, but that's my opnion]
