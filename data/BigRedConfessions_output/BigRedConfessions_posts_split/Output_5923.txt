I couldn't be more disappointed in you. I knew she was a bitch, but I thought you'd stick by me. Instead, you let her push you around and you do whatever our other "friends" say. Apparently now the memo is to not talk to me? Ok, cool. I just hope you don't come running back to me when those people are gone.
