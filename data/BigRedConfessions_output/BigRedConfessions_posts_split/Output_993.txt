I hope whoever you are that you thankful for yourself this thanksgiving. You have been through so much and yet you remain strong. You have had your ego bruised and your heart broken. You have been misplaced, mistreated, and misunderstood and yet you have not become bitter. You recognize that today is another day not only to love yourself but to be your best self and that the wrongdoings of your past must be left in your past. No matter who you are, no matter the changes you want and have yet to institute, you are the one and unique you and that is something not only to take gratitude in this thanksgiving but to rejoice in.
