I am going to develop a project and a proposal to create a people mover system underneath Cornell with station entrances inside the most widely used buildings so people don't have to walk outside during the brutal winters. What's more is the people mover system will be near the massive steam mains going underneath the roads through Cornell. It will be a win-win with a warm tunnel where students who are willing to pay the fare could get to class. If you don't want to pay the fare, you can freeze your ass above ground when it reaches below 30F. I can then charge $2.75 or more per trip with a monthly pass available at $150. My whole system would be powered by electricity produced from Pennsylvania coal, natural gas, or nuclear power plants so that my expenses are minimal and the system could be reliable. I am a student and an entrepreneur who loves the spirit of capitalism on which this great country was founded.
