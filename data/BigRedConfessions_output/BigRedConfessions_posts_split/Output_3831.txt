So I was talking to my little brother over break. I asked him why he wanted to be a doctor and he basically rehashed the same shit everyone says: "I want to help". I just laughed. What's he gonna do? Grab his bag of help and sprinkle a little help here and a little help there until the entire hospital is just fucking daisies and sunshine? Get real kid. I KNOW why I want to be a doctor. I want the money, the bitches, the cars, the penthouse in Manhattan, the premium-Grade A Colombian cocaine, the prestige, and the POWER. Above all. The Power. Being able to whisper into the ear of the girl your screwing: "I'm an M.D. I'm an M.D." over and over again is just amazing. That. And the ability to choose any mail-order bride I want from India to make mom happy and proud. The end.
