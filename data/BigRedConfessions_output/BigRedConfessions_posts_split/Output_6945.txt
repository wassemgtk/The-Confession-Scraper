I'm the kind of guy that gets labeled an asshole all too often and it really sucks. Just because I put on a confident demeanor and try to act like I don't give a fuck doesn't mean I'm a bad person. And now that I actually did fuck up and do something asshole-ish your girlfriends just assume that's who I am. Well it's not and I care about you more than you know. You know me far better than they do, for the love of god make your own decision. If I don't get a second chance I at least want it to be your choice, but if I do I'll never break your trust again.
