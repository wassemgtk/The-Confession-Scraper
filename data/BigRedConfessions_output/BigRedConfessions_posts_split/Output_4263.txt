"I remember the first time I met you.  We and some other friends walked down to Barton during O-week for the bouncy castle party.  You were very quiet, introverted, but actually really funny.  I didn't ask you too many questions since you didn't seem comfortable with me doing so.
I've talked to you a few more times since then, and admittedly, even gone out of my way just to see you in the library to say hi and study stuff next to you.
The only thing is, I actually don't know anything about you.I know where you're from, I know what instruments you dabbled in, but nothing about your hometown, your likes, dislikes; nothing about you.  I've never asked because you never seemed willing to tell me and I never wanted to pry and make you feel uncomfortable.  But it's honestly driving me crazy.  Like, it's the biggest distraction.
I really hope that you don't feel like I'm being creepy, but goddammit, if I am, I wish you'd just tell me so that I wouldn't have to be so worried about making you uncomfortable.  I can understand you not wanted to talk; I hate talking too, actually.  But please, just give me a sign or something, something more than just a passing ""hi"" and a wave... just so that I can know what's going on?
Just tell me something...
