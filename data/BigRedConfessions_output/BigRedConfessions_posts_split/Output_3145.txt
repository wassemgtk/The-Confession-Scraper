I tried posting before but it didn't show up. I'm not sure why. Anyway the gist of it is that I miss you. I realize now that the reason I make a good boyfriend is because I'm deathly afraid of the single life. It's a cold, barren, cutthroat post-apocalyptic wasteland where none are loyal beyond themselves. The stress of being "good enough" for you is a large part of what caused the anxiety that caused our problems. I wish that I had done something about it sooner, because I still love you.
