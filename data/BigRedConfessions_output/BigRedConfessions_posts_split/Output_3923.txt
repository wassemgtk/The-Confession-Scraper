When I was 10-going-on-11, I would check the mail constantly in the hopes that I would get a Hogwarts acceptance letter just like Harry "Dumbledore's Pet" Potter. Every single day of the summer between 5th and 6th grade, I would check the mailbox hoping that it would come. It never did. But I kept my hopes up. All throughout middle school I waited and waited, hoping that some mixup happened--my owls died in the trans-Atlantic journey, I was magically stunted developmentally and so matured at a later date, Dumbledore hated me because I was brown, loved hip-hop, and had a big dick, etc. As the weeks became months and the months became years, I eventually had to focus on doing well in school and getting along with my filthy Muggle friends. By the time 12th grade rolled around, I knew it was too late. Even if I somehow managed to make it into Hogwarts, I'd be 7 years younger than the incoming freshman. So I toughened up and applied to college. You filthy Muggles will never know what it's like to settle for Cornell over Hogwarts. The only time I feel happy is when I'm walking up the slope and the fucking watchtower is playing my jam: "The Harry Potter Theme Song". #FuckMuggles #FuckMudBloods #FuckBeingAnEngineerIWantToBeAFuckingWizard #FuckDumbledore #FuckHarryPotter
