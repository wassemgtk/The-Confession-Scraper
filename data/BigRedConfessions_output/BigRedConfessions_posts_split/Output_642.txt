Why do people go to schools like Cornell (i.e. the Ivy League)? At the end of the day, once I graduate, I'll just be working some entry-level engineering position with people from state schools and community colleges who spent a lot less money. I'm just confused as to what Cornell offers besides 'prestige' (whatever that means).
