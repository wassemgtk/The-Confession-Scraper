So I'm a TA for this class. And I'm not a timid or shy person; I always ask people how they're 
doing, say hi, etc. 

I've always felt weird about this prof who I TA for.  I'm not sure if its something just in my head, but I've always felt she treated me differently. like for example I've always noticed that she'll walk around the class, and always talks to the other TAs (who are white), and ask how their weekend was, or what plans they've got. When she walks by me, she rarely acknowledges me. It's really strange. I don't know what to make of this, and i feel like I'm like getting pushed into self perpetuating some stereotype about submissive and easily ignored Asians. 

Anyway, everything else besides the weirdly being ignored part was fine until today. Today they just had to take a prelim, and I have been so swamped with work, that I hadn't had time to finish some grading. there's like 3-4 files to grade per student each week (which is a ton, its awful). I did finish the grading the night before the prelim, but without her noticing on Blackboard. She sends me this very angry email. 

Ok, thats fine. I understand, I should have graded it earlier. During class, we talk and she basically says she's not happy with me. That's whatever, fine too. Then the other TA comes in, sits down and she purposefully turns around, completely blocking me off, to whisper to the other TA about the exam and what students were asking while I stood right behind her. Clearly she was actively making a point of excluding me or something, like hello I am also one of your TAs. Is this some type of retaliation/punishment for the grading issue? I didn't really know what to do - she kept whispering to the other TA while I just stood there, so i just walked away. 

Does this seem weird to anyone else?
