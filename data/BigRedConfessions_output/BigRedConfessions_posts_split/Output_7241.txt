Here's a real confession: I couldn't give fewer fucks about the Arts Quad guy. Good for him reading and all, but I personally don't care about it and I don't want to hear about it. He isn't "revolutionary" or "making a difference". No offense to you Arts Quad guy, I'm sure you are a swell kid. But it should be obvious that your actions will garner both good and bad attention.
