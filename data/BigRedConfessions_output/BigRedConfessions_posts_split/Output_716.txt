I don't understand the people on for sale at cornell who try to sell their used clothes or used furniture/dishes/household things for high prices, such as selling a used dress for $100+ or a new jacket or watch for $200+.. Of course they are probably nice things especially with brand names, but someone can easily buy a *new* item in most cases for cheaper than the prices offered that might be of *slightly* lesser quality
