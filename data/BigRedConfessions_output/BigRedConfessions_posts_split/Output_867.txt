If I were in the same mental state I was years ago, Cornell would drive me over the edge. Luckily for me, I managed to overcome the extreme issues during high school. That being said, with 21,000 people here, I'm sure some people are in the kind of mental state that I've had before.

Finals are horrible. Cornell can be horrible. If you're feeling down because of that, then please find help. Gannett and EARS can provide a multitude of references for where to get free, confidential help.
