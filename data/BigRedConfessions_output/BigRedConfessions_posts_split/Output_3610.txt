I am scared that I might go blind very soon.  I inherited by father's poor eyesight and it gets significantly worse every-time I am under stress.  I cannot see the board even though I sit in the front row.  The doctor says rate of deterioration gets worse when working on computers for long periods of time, but how can I stop if my major requires using a computer 24/7?
