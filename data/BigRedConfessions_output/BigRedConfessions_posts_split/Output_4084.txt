"Is it rape if I initially consented but later changed my mind and didn't tell him? He told me the only way he saw to get me to give him a blowjob was to force me to do it. I just wanted to get it over with so he would leave. I should have made him leave but iw as scared of his reaction. I felt so dirty afterwards I had to shower again and change my sheets so I could sleep.

I don't know who to talk to about this because I feel lime it's my fault and everyone will tell me it is. I invited him over, I let him fuck me, I didn't say no and I didn't fight back. I should have never consented to it but now it's too late. Idk what to do with myself.
