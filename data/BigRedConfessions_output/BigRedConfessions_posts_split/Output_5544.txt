I feel really stupid posting something so trivial when everyone's stressed about finals and grades, but it really bothers me that I'm 20 years old and I've never been in a relationship. In high school I felt a little rejected but it didn't phase me as much because I knew that when I got to college there would be a plethora of individuals I could possibly date...but I've been here two years and nothing! It's so discouraging to think that half my college career is over and I've never once had a guy interested in me. NOT ONCE! It makes me feel so inadequate and terrible about myself. And I know you shouldn't measure you self-worth by the amount of attention you receive from the opposite sex but it's still a confidence booster, a validation that you're a somewhat decent human being. I just really wish someone could see that in me, could notice me and not find me lacking. Again, I'm sorry for how trivial and vain that was.
