"I have been really antisocial when I was a freshman. Yes I was that antisocial guy who never came out from his room. I constantly reminded myself that I was happy with everything in Cornell. To forget that I am not lonely, I intentionally made myself busy with everything that I really did not need to do. I feared going back to my dorm because I thought people living in my hallway would see me and end up back-talking. I woke up really early in the morning to take shower because I did not want to be seen by others even in the bathroom or kitchen. I stayed in the library late in the night (until when the Olin library closed), and I intentionally used other staircases so that people, at least people in my unit, cannot see me. I wanted them to forget that I am living in that room. When there was a party going outside the corridor and I could hear it, I just did nothing sitting in my room. I slept for 24hours, I did not eat anything. There was one rumor I overheard that years before one of the freshmen guys committed suicide in his room in the dorm I was living and no one noticed that for more than a month because he was so antisocial I even talked to myself. It was the smell of the rotten body that later made people know that he committed suicide. And I later thought: ""If I do the same thing, no one will notice me and I would be dead and unknown for 1 month like that person was.""

I hope there are no one currently living in North Campus doing the same thing that I have done because the freshmen year in college was the most miserable year of my life. Please talk to someone, go find EARS, go talk to your parents, go talk to your advisor, anyone. Please talk to anyone. Talking brings a lot of change in your life. Please don't be me and spend your wonderful freshmen year like I have done."
