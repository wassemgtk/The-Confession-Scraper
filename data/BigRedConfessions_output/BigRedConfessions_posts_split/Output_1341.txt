I am a woman of color with thick curly hair. It is frustrating that almost everyday a stranger (usually white) puts their hands in my hair without my permission. This is usually followed by some back-handed compliment. I get even more frustrated when these same people get upset when I say that I don't like their behavior. My hair is not a playground nor is it a zoo. I don't care if you're curious. And no, I am not being sensitive. My hair is very personal to me. Please respect my personal space.
