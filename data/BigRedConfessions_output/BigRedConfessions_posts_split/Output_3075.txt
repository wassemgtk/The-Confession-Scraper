Hi there.  

It's hard for me to say those words to you in real life.  It's been a year now and although I'm not completely over you, I've seen other guys who've hurt me/I've hurt and I think I'm ready to be friends with you.  But I don't know if you want me in your life at all since you're the one who broke it all off, albeit only after a hell of a lot of crazy.  You stuck around a long time all things considered.  When we weren't being crazy--which was usually, actually--we were on the exact same wavelength.  We thought the same stupid things were funny.  We had an easy banter--from day one in fact.  And I miss that, even without any of the romantic strings attached.

And lately I've seen you around a lot for various reasons and you've been...well, you've stopped acting like I was a complete stranger.  Which could just mean that my company just means nothing to you in any form anymore.

I want to reach out to you.  Try to become friends again.  But I'm not going to.  I practically smothered you last time, and I don't want you to feel awkward or obligated to do anything.  And if you do read this and realize that it's me, just pretend like you never saw this if you don't want anything to do with me.  Let me live in disbelief that you may someday decide you want to talk to me again.  But if you do want to talk to me...let me know.

I just think back to winter break last year, and the texts we sent.  They could've been just between friends, and I was happy with just that.  Can we go back to that?

(P.S. my life really isn't that shitty right now.  I'm in a good place and this isn't me being depressing and bemoaning the fact that my life is over without you--it isn't.)
