I find myself more physically attracted to more men of other races than I do men that have the same skin color as I do. And I don't understand why it's classified as a fever if I happen to be crushing on or dating an Asian guy. Why can't I like who I like? He's a human, I'm a human, I find him attractive; why's that bad?
