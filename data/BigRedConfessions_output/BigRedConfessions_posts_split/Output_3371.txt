Dear people in the library listening to headphones so loud that I can hear the words to the song you're listening to,

You are rude. Learn to have some courtesy, you're not the only person in the world.  I know you're all proud of your expensive "beats" but no one cares.  

Sincerely,
A super annoyed person trying to study in a public space
