I'm deathly scared of what will happen when the impending environmental crisis hits. It sends my heart racing sometimes and I don't see myself as a weak-minded individual. It's a problem that everyone seems to be ignoring and doing nothing about. Why don't you people care? Do you realize what will happen within our own lifetime? All anyone seems to care about in this university and in other places is: get a well-paying job, find a hot wife, retire early in your 40's as a millionaire, preserve your wealth for your progeny while banging a few chicks/guys on the side. I'm not saying we have to become hippies and destroy industrialization altogether...just that there might be better ways to go about it. People should stop labeling environmentalists as radical, free-loving, banjo-playing pot heads and realize this is a serious threat. Wake up Cornell. Please.
