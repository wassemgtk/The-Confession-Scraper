How do girls preferred to be approached? I want to talk to a girl I see on campus but don't know what to say. Sometimes I would follow her trying to think of things to say...it's really creepy and I don't want to be a creep, but I feel like approaching a random girl I don't know would be awkward, especially without knowing how to do it or what to say.
