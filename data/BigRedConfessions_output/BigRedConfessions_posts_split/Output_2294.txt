Oh, interested in something? Here, take a class on it? Oh, you dropped it because it was too hard? Hmm... that's a shame, perhaps you weren't interested in it in the first place!

I can't recall how many times this have happened here. I feel like Cornell has zapped all of my academic interests. The only thing I want to do now is not have a huge pile of work looming over my head and be free from this hell.
