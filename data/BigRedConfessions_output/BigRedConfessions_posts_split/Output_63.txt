After graduating from 🐻 this is me 😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎. I am so happy to be done with bullshit school work that in no way prepared me for my successful career, where I am making six figures. Life is so much easier in the real world than academic horseshit. I am making money and I can spend it to buy nice things and don't have to pull all nighters.
