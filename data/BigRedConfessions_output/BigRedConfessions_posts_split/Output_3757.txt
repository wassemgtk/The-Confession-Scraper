I'm sorry .. I like you I really do, that's why I didn't tell you about him, I've been with him for almost two years and I didn't want to ruin the smile I saw every time I saw you. I'm so sorry, I know that it was selfish, and that it was stupid for me to have some kind of hope that maybe we could be together, but I was scared that you might not have even liked me yet alone be interested in girls and I was selfish in not risking what I have for what I could have had. I'm sorry baby seal
