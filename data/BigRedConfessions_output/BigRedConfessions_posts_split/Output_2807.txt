Shall I be considered insane for seeking to be alone most of the time and feeling a sense of comfort from it? I don't have any sort of desire to be known at all. I would be just fine if I ceased to exist in this moment...

Yet since my eyes still wake up every morning to the flutter of birds outside my window, I say "make every moment count for myself." And that entails absorbing words from certain novels, making my own creations, watering my plants, soaking in the beams of light. I have been cursed with an anxious yet beautiful mind and sometimes other people just seem to not understand that...

I do not want to be normal and if this is what my heart and mind tell me to do, I shall have no problem doing it.

But, I have to admit, I do seek love. True love. I think about love so much that I'm afraid that it may become painful. I question whether true love is a myth, an illusion...

I think about love so often because I can finally say that I love myself. Others see it, I know they do. Others turn their heads. What is so wrong with finally loving the skin and mind you were given? I say nothing. I'm in a new direction and I want to show another how to love. It is beautiful in my mind and I wait for the day that my mind ceases to be tormented for the sake of another. I want to care so deeply for another yet my intense fear stops me from doing so.

Nothing hurts anymore because I have trained my mind to perceive and remember in a beautiful way. I can even say the fear I experience is beautiful. I want another to see the fear within and claim it as beautiful. Are you out there? Will you exist in my world, please?
