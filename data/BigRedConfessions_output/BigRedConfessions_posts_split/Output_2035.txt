I am so lonely. I generally do okay on my own, find fulfillment in my work and hobbies, etc. But it all still seems like a kind of distraction when I realize that there's still something missing, something big.

 I wanted to explore the trails and try out new things this summer...which I am doing...but there's only so much of that I want to do either with my friends or by myself. I've been living alone and single for six months now and I'm just starting to lose hope that I will ever find anyone compatible. I've lost a bunch of weight and toned up, gotten a bit more confident talking to men each time I've gone on a date, etc. but I rarely connect and, on the rare occasion that I do, that connection hasn't been reciprocated. What the fuck am I doing wrong?! Well, I think I intimidate the hell out of some men just by casually mentioning my work and accomplishments early on so I've toned that down though I think I needn't. Other than that, I'm completely lost. There's nothing else on which I can introspect. Maybe I'm just being impatient but my heart feels heavier and heavier each time I see a couple embrace at Stewart Park at sunset or share an intimate moment in front of me. The multiple rejections are just making things worse after my break-up but I don't want to give up.
