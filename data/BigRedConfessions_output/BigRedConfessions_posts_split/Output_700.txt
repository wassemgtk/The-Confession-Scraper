My dad says that if Trump wins, america won't be safe for muslim citizens anymore and we'll have to move. He also thinks that it would be more difficult for me to get a job while Trump's president. I've heard comments from Trump supporters that make me think my dad is mostly right. 

I would never say this stuff out loud, since it's overly emotional and possibly paranoid. So I'll just submit this as a confession. Are my fears legitimate? I really hope not.
