We have been dating for several years and the distance made me realize that we are not best for each other. I am extremely career focused and I live under high pressure. He hates the fast paced workplace culture and I know he won't be happy with my pursuit to become a doctor. I probably won't date anyone again until I am ready for marriage. I feel it is irresponsible to fall in love and cannot be together because of financial and distance problems.
