I make for a pretty ungrateful piece of shit son.  I almost didn't call my mother on mother's day.  I barely call my parents at all.  They usually have to call me.  It's not that I hate my parents.  I just hate talking on the phone.  But it gets worse.  When I see the posts of "I wuv my parents oh so vewy vewy much", I can never imagine myself saying that.  I almost don't really know how to show compassion to my parents anymore.  Perhaps it's a guy thing.  Perhaps the stress of Cornell has just turned me cold and bitter.  Perhaps I'm just an asshole who can't appreciate what his parents have done for him.  Who knows :/
