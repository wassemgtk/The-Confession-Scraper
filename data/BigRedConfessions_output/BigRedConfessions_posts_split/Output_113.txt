After graduating Cornell, I became a project manager that has union representation in NYC with the  Amalgamated Transit Union. I only support American jobs now by purchasing union-made products and services that my brothers and sisters make or take part in. I make sure my morning snack of donuts is made by the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers, and Grain Millers International Union (BCTGM). My lunch is union-made by the local Italian restaurant. (I love eggplant parmigiana and a cannoli for desert)  I also buy General Motors cars, with my recent purchase of a Corvette made my United Auto Workers union workers in Kentucky. I also make sure that my cigars are made by workers in the BCTGM. I love driving to work in my Corvette smoking a thick cigar while listening to Frank Sinatra or Sammy Davis, Jr. My favorite songs are "New York, New York" and "I Gotta Be Me." If you don't like my life style or think I make too much with my benefits and thick pension plan, I can tell you one thing the old New York way "kiss my damn ass and fuggetaboutit." My dad is the local union boss and you can go complain to him. I dare you to.
