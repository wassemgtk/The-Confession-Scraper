I want you back so badly.  How did I err?  I tried my best every day to be the best partner,  I'm sorry if I ever hurt you and didn't realize it.  I'm sorry for anything I might have ever done wrong.  I just wanted to show you that the perfect lover/friend/partner existed and that it had my name.  However, it's not my place to call you and beg for your return since you're the one who broke it off.  We were so perfect hours before and then all of a sudden...you said it was over. I don't understand.  I never did. That is the only part of you I never figured out.
