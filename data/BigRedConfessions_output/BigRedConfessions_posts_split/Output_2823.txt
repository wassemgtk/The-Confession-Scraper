The worst feeling is expecting to be disappointed but still feeling every bit of it. You know nothing has changed. You know the same actions will be taken, since it feels like they always are. But the smallest bit of you has hope, that maybe this time it will be different, and that hope meets your realism, causing  a pit of despair that no logic or emotions can climb you out of until you are proven right. Only then does the pit stop growing, and you can finally get out, just waiting for the next time to fall in. Waiting, foolishly, because that small bit of hope keeps you there, even though you know it shouldn't be.
