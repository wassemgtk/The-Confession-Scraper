I was in the stacks the other day and I let loose a silent, but deadly one. Unfortunately, just seconds later this really hot girl I know and have a crush on sees me from the aisle. She began to make her way through the book shelves towards me. Unfortunately, she didn't know about the ringed fortress of a 3 foot radius that I had set up just moments earlier. Suffice it to say that when she had come within range of my noxious gases, she couldn't penetrate any further. She wrinkled her nose, grew red in the face, and walked away in absolute disgust. If you're reading this, please, please, please know that I still have an insane crush on you and am ashamed of what I've done. I really like you....but now I can't even come near you......
