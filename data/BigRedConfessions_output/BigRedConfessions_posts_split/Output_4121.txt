"People often say I'm ""alternative"" ""artsy"" or a  hipster, and I'm not necessarily doing anything to dispel those beliefs. Usually I'm into the ""alternative"" guy, the punks, the artists, the musicians, you know the type, scruffy with nice shoes and maybe smoking a cigarette?
Anyway, for some reason, I've been really interested in the more athletic, clean cut dudes lately. It's not at parties that I find them attractive in their pastel button downs, it's the guys walking across the quad in cozy looking patagonia pullovers and canvas sneakers, that I would love to go home with and we'd study for a bit and maybe hook up and he'd text me to come over and watch a movie or get pizza. I don't want a guy who's completely invested in me, but someone who cares and it doesn't have to be complicated.
I'm so used to having long intellectual talks over coffee and having to do ""interesting"" things with hipster guys, don't get me wrong, I love it, but it gets tiring and I wouldn't mind just getting back to the basics with a cute guy who doesn't judge me based on if I've ""heard of this band on bandcamp.""
