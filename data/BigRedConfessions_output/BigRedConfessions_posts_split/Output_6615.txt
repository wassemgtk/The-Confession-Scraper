I'm not considered very smart at Cornell, and I feel like guys here get really turned off from girls who are kind of stupid. It's not that I'm stupid on purpose! I'm still a perfectly nice person and I'd love if you wanted to educate me about the things you find me so lacking in. I know you probably want to be able to carry out deep conversations about [insert complex theoretical shiz here] but I really can't keep up, and I'm sorry... What if I still want to be with you? Does that bother you?
