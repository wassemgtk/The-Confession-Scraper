I am tired of feeling this way. I'm tired of feeling insignificant compared to other guys. I'm tired of losing friends, or having my texts ignored, of feeling like a complete social failure. I've been on my own for quite a while now and I have a feeling that it's not going to change. I just don't know what to do. I'm not asking to get laid or anything like that, I just want to be sociable, funny, interesting. Honestly, if it weren't for my family members and the grief, shame, and trauma it would cause them (on top of bills from my loans), I think I would have offed myself a long time ago. I hope things get better.
