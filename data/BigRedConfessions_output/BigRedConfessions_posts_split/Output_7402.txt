"I am on the brink of a nervous breakdown. I've realized I've gotten into some terrible patterns. I hate myself right now. What's worse is my mom just got beaten up by my little brother (he's a psycho). I just want to go home and I don't want to tell anyone about this. I honestly don't think any one could possibly understand. I have great friends here and yet I feel so alone.
I don't know what the hell is happening to me.
I feel like complete shit. 
I'm not suicidal at all... but I just don't know how I'm going to make it through the rest of this semester."
