"Back in mid 2010 I stumbled upon this neat internet currency called Bitcoin, and I thought it was pretty cool, so I bought some, and then more.  Eventually I had poured my savings I made from tutoring and washing dishes during my summers into it.  It wasn't a whole lot, but it was everything I had, and a lot more than I was willing to lose.  Eventually I kinda forgot about it because I was busy with school and girls, but one day my friend asked me if I was still invested, because the price was at $180.  I told him I wasn't.  I was.  Eventually the price had risen above $1100 a piece at which point I was avidly following every rise and dip.  

I was preparing to sell when the price dropped to ~$875 following its peak.  I had spoken to a lawyer about declaring my gains to the IRS and all that jazz.  I was gonna have just shy of 8 figures to my name.  My entire life I'd been told that I'd work hard and bust my ass so that I might be able to experience comfort and success in life.  It didn't matter that I didn't want to go into business or accounting or finance as my dad had demanded.  What I wanted didn't matter in the grand scheme of things, but because I was curious and made a lucky decision a couple years before, I was gonna be free.  I would be able to forego all that bullshit and study what I want to study, maybe go to trade school and become a carpenter like I had always wanted.  I was gonna be free from the financial stress that looms over the average American's head.  I was gonna be free.  

One day I came home to find that my dad, without my permission, had sold my computer to a friend of his.  It was sitting under my bed, unused, so he figured I didn't need it anymore.  And just like that, everything I had invested in was gone.  I didn't eat for weeks.  I haven't spoken more than a few sentences to my dad since.  It's been about a year now.

I'm here and I see all these people studying their asses off to get some high-paying job to be able to feel secure in life, and I can relate because I'm here for the same reason.  But unlike them, I had the golden opportunity to be able to retire at 18 years old, and my dad sold it for a couple hundred bucks to his friend.  

So I'm sorry if I'm not all that talkative and outgoing.  I'm just a little fucking bitter.
