This is in response to the comment responding to #6423, from someone who said that maybe the foreign students from Asia don't tip because that's not their culture and that maybe the waitress should adapt to their culture in attempts for more tips:

Your argument is ridiculous and belittles the fact that these waiters and waitresses aren't making tips because someone from another country hasn't learned the customs of their current country, which they absolutely should learn to some extent if they intend to be here for a few years. I'm not saying that their culture is wrong or that the american culture is better, but when in rome do as the romans do.

You wouldn't travel to another country and expect those people to adapt to your culture because hey, maybe that will make you feel more comfortable.

These students not tipping should have learned about these cultural norms, particularly tipping because there are huge disparities between almost every country in regards to tipping. Should the waitress then ask where every foreigner is from (which may be disrespectful in itself) and then go in the back and google that countries' customs on dining out and adapt every time? 
That's ridiculous, and your argument is ridiculous. I understand if you were just trying to clear the air by explaining that they're not used to this, but you suggested that the waitress adapt to them. And the fact that you [that commenter] tend to tip more in Asian restaurants because they bother you less or adapt to your needs greater than someone else's, that's so rude and you shouldn't forgo tipping someone because they took the time to make sure you were enjoying your meal, like so sorry that someone is trying to be polite. and you know in some cases people do have something to say when asked that, even if you don't have the balls to admit if something is wrong.

I'm not even a server or in a food service job but this just irked me so much.
