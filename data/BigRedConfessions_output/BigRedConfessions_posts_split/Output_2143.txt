I am an international student from a wealthy family. My parents recently told me that I probably will not have to worry about money for the rest of my life because they have made enough for me. I realize I am very privileged but that fact still does not take away from the fact that I'm scared. I'm scared because my parents want me to move back to my home country upon graduation, and I want to stay here. I'm scared because I don't know what my future holds. I'm scared because I don't know if I'll ever be able to live up to my dad's accomplishments. Even though I've lived a luxurious life, I get jealous of my friends who come from normal American homes. I'm a coward and no one knows it, because I hide behind a mask of confidence.
