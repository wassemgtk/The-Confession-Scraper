Ya know, when Ludacris said offensive things, a lot of people cheered. I want to slap these offended people who are claiming the crowd was stunned or shocked by what was said. Most people kept on grinding, drinking, making out, doing drugs, and cheering as they had been before. You can't tell me something is offensive to all women when the six women standing near me are all cheering...

[Didn't realize that you were surrounded by the only 6 women on the planet. Don't generalize, breh.]
