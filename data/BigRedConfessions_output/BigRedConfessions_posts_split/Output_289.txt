You sound like somebody that I used to know. Please don't cut yourself and please, please don't jump into a gorge. Of course your family cares about you. They wouldn't work overtime to support you if they didn't. They're proud of you!
You are not a well of negativity nor are you bad at relationships. I think you're a wonderful person and someday it will all work out with the right person.
Everyone struggles with classes here. It's Cornell. Just remember there is a life outside of college!
And moreover, you should learn to love yourself. Once you are comfortable in your own skin, you will find happiness. If no one else, I care about you. So please don't do anything drastic.
