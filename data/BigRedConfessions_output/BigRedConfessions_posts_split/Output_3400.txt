We've slept together 3 times and each time was perfect. Sleeping close with you after was amazing. Now when I sleep I have to put a pillow into my chest and imagine it's you otherwise I can't fall asleep. I miss the touch of your smooth soft skin and the smell of your soft hair. I love how perfectly our bodies had fit together when we spooned. I know we're not a couple but I wish you could sleep next to me every night. I actually dream about this girl and wake up looking for her and the last time we slept together was over a month ago
