I feel like every where I turn, Cornell is trying to squeeze more and more money out of me. One of my professors uses a unique version of the textbook so student have to buy it through the store, even though it it almost no different from the original. Another professor says that the book store stopped carrying his class's text because he refused to use the newest edition. I get parking tickets in areas that are not clearly marked. They charge for the pool tables in rpcc. All of the food is way more expensive than it has to be. I think I pay enough to go here to not need to pay for every little thing once I get here.
