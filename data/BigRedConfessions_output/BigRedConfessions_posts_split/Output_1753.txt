I don't think I'm suitable for the working life. For some reason, I just can't get through interviews. I'm an engineering student with almost 4.0 gpa, I consider myself pretty well-rounded and sociable, I'm competitive and always try to stay at the top of the class, but I just feel so insecure and inadequate when I'm interviewing. I guess that has affected my performance and I just keep getting denied. Getting a summer internship was a huge struggle, and here I am again, being interviewed every single day in the past week for a full-time job and no offers so far. I just feel so incompetent and dumb, it could be that I just haven't found anyone with whom I just "clicked" or perhaps I'm just good in figuring out how to pass exams..
