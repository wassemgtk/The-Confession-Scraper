I was sheltered as a child in an extremely religious household (almost a cult in my view) and my freshman year went so terribly.  I don't have any friends and I feel lonely everywhere I go.  My overbearing dad still yells at me in my head and I can't even be real with my parents and its absolutely awful.  I don't want to live anymore and I feel so frustrated that so much of my childhood was taken from me.  I'm 19 and now trying to rediscover who I am.
