I absolutely love this school, and am having an amazing time here. But one thing that makes me incredibly sad is how it breaks people down and makes people feel inadequate. The test-based grades are hell for people who aren't good test takers, and the image associated with this school makes people feel like they can't get help. Please, please please please if you're feeling depressed or having trouble here, talk to someone about it. There is no shame in asking for help, whether that is mental, emotional or school help. It breaks my heart to see people miserable here..
