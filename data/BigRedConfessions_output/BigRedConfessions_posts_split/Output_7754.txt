Never believed in Santa. Always hated Santa. But after enduring Santa I have become so cold. All I do now a days is just be Santa. At first I thought it was anger that made me Santa but as days have gone by I have realized that I have nothing more to say to u. Never felt this before and I never wanna feel this ever again. Just waiting for the semester to end so that I never ever see u again in my life.
