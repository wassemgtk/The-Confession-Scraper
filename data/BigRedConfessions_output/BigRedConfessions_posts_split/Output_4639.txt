It is so fucking hard for me to get the courage to talk to people. I think that I am so worthless and pathetic that I do not deserve to have any fun or friends. I've constantly heard that we have to talk to people and be well-known to have both connections and friends, but it is so hard to say "hey" to people, let alone be this person that people enjoy being around. I've really been trying though, but I get too scared to approach people. Every time that I do, I end up either babbling/stuttering like an idiot, or sounding extremely boring (because I'm too afraid to let out my weirdness)... I I don't want to bother people or force them to be around me or make them hate me... UGH... I think I'm being an attention seeker right now, but meh... Sorry... just meh. I'm sorry to everyone I've forced myself upon & I'm sorry for everyone who wasted their time reading my shitty ramblings.
