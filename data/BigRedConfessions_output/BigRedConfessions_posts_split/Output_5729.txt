"Today, a friend told me about his ex, who interned for the Grameen Bank as a high school student, the World Bank as an undergrad, founded an NGO funded by the Clinton Foundation, won a national essay contest, was in the running to be picked as an Olympic athlete, and is a talented singer. And apparently that's not all before I made him stop talking.

I started this post with the intention of sharing some self-deprecating humor, but as more time goes by, the worse I feel. What am I even doing with my life? I've come to realize that I've been starting to settle for ""good enough"" while still being conceited enough to think that I could leave my mark on the world. I'm just another kid that gets ""good enough"" grades and ""good enough"" internships and will probably get a ""good enough"" job. If I'm lucky, maybe. I don't have a cause. There's nothing in particular I fight for. I don't know why I'm alive. I feel useless to this world and I don't know where to start to improve myself. Crippling jealousy and despair seem to be programmed into my very identity. I start to hate myself, hate other people. What do I do?"
