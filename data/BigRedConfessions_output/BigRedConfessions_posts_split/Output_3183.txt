To the girls in my lab who thought I was judging your actions,
I was not critically judging you as you probably think I was. I am just having a horrible day and I am super tired and when both of these things happen, I stare off into space without realizing I was looking directly at you. My friends always tell me that I appear to stare seriously into space, so I am sorry about the misinterpreted communication.
