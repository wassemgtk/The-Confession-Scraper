I'm probably falling in love. It's terrifying to me because i'm opening myself up to trusting someone not to hurt me. There are so many fears I have. What if we don't make it but I still want to be with them? What if we realize we aren't meanr for each other? But I have never felt this way about someone and so i'm going through with it. But I'm still really nervous.
