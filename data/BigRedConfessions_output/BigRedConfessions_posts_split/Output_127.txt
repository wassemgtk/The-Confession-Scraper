I'm a minority studies minor, but I think it's important to recognize the issues with international students in US schools in the past decade. Schools are eager to accept them in order to get more money- especially Cornell. Beyond that, many countries have issues with bribes in relation to fixing test scores, GPAs, recommendations, etc. Seeing international students watch American shows with subtitles of their mother tongue seems to reinforce those issues- or maybe the TOEFL is just an inadequate basis of language skills. Regardless, international students are great, but should get in based on merit. Those students who barely try to speak English for the 4 years that there here have no good right to be here. This is not a condemnation of those with poor language skills, but one of those who don't try, and likely got into this school for the wrong reasons.
