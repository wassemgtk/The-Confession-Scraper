As a transfer student, I was considered the best, or at least very talented in many different areas both in high school and my previous institution. But here at Cornell, I'm not the best or especially talented at anything. Moreover, a lot of the classes I took at my previous institution, which was regarded as a good school, did not prepare me for the level of breadth and depth presented even in the introductory level courses here. I feel dumb and so behind. Every time I try to ask questions, people look at me like there's something wrong with me for not knowing the answer. I feel like I'm never going to fit in here.
