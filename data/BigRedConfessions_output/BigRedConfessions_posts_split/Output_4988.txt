I am choosing to skip my old best friend's wedding today.  I feel like a horrible person, I truly do.  This will be the first time that I have ever done something this selfish before.  I know it is the wrong thing to do, but after everything he put me through over the years and the current status of our friendship I just can't muster up the strength to go.  Things just aren't the same anymore, they haven't been for a long time now.  I know he feels bad about everything that went on between us, and that he regrets it and wants to make everything up to me, but we haven't seen each other in over a year now and besides words I have not seen him trying.  I don't think hanging out for the first time should be on his wedding day to a girl he has been dating less than a year that I know nothing about.   I hope I don't come to regret this someday, but I know this is my choice and I will live with the consequences.  I guess this confession is me finally saying that I don't feel I owe him anything anymore and if we wants me to be his friend again he will have to work for it. If not, then maybe our paths will cross again another time in life....Time to stop living in the past and figure out my future.  I can't wait to get back to Cornell and start senior year off right.
