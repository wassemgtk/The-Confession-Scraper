I was talking to this really cute girl that some might consider out of my league, but she wasn't noticeably trying to get away from it. I was a little. Because I thought that the longer I talked the more likely I was to make an ass of myself, but I hope it didn't come off as rude. I prevented myself from asking her out and I'm pretty sure I was blushing for a good amount of it. I might go for it.
