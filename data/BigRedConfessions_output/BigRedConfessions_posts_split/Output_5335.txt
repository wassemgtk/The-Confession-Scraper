Um, I still miss you.  WHY did you never try to talk to me when we were in my room, when I told you about how I felt that you weren't treating me well as a friend, and also how you didn't VOICE your OWN opinions, expressing individuality and uniqueness that made me like you in the first place??  I can't understand why you didn't at least try to understand what I was saying and GIVE ME some type of response.  All you said was idk idk idk idk , idk idk idk idk.  I would have waited for you for years, even if you expressed later on that you felt I wasn't right for you.  It would have been all cool with me.  Really, it would have been all cool.  I don't understand why girls in general give mixed signals and try to act like they're not interested or don't AT LEAST care to have a guy friend around them.  WHO WAS THERE to help you with your calc homework? WHO WAS THERE to give you encouragement when you were stressed out? WHO WAS THERE to talk to you? WHO WAS THERE to eat food with you almost every day? I feel like life is unfair a lot of times to guys who have good intentions but can't get a girl because she's either too attached to home or someone at home. Do me a favor and grow up, you were different than anything I saw before and I don't understand why you couldn't change a little, even a tiny tiny little, to see me for what I was.

I can't do this anymore I'm becoming too emotional and I was supposed to MOVE ON more than a year ago since I last talked to you.  I mostly have, but I still can't care about anyone.  Remember when I told you that too?  I feel emotionless, even though I still have close friends that are almost all guys.  I feel that I'm going to get MORE hurt if I like someone and then I won't trust anyone for good for my whole life.  It's nice to know that you laughed at me because I ate the same food (pizza) every day at Appel or RPCC, and that you laughed at me when I texted you as a "joke" but you yourself never texted me before as a friend to even say hi.  It's nice to know that you weren't even honest with me and another girl told me that you were basically lying to me, and that you needed to be honest with me.  WHY weren't you?? ...why? It's also nice to know that you knew I was mad at you but didn't even come to say what's up, to at least try to salvage something before I talked with you.  OH WAIT LET ME THINK, what kind of damn friend is that, if even a person who I would want to be my girlfriend, someone who is supposed to be with ME? I'll give you a translation baby - I mean someone who rides with me and listens to what the hell I'm thinking and at least gives HALF A DAMN.  But wait, remember that I won't forget about you - I ALWAYS listened to what you're saying too and I praised you.  You made me happy.  Remember when I used to knock on your door to wake you up for class? Lol I was such an idiot, I should have let you gone late, and your GPA would have been even lower than it already was for your first semester.  And I could have used someone's support when I was going through stuff later on.  And you know what the hell I'm talking about, "stuff" is an understatement for what happened to me.

And these emotions don't help with the hell that I had to go through this year.  I guess I'll just sleep and go on with my daily routine tomorrow, I'll find a way to keep on going and be stronger so that no one can ever hurt me again.  No one, not even you.  You.  I definitely have trust issues with regular girls that I meet at places I work, etc.  Thanks for this too, I really love it!!

And then you go on to tell someone that you were only emotionally attracted to me.  DON'T even say that.  AND THEN YOU ASK HOW I'M DOING in the beginning of this school year to other people that I talk to.. don't even say that either. I don't understand why you tried to make everything so complicated, I made everything so simple by just trying to hang out and get to know you.  I still can't understand it.  And I can't understand why you're so political with everyone, who cares if someone doesn't like you? I cared about you more than anyone who could have hated you.
