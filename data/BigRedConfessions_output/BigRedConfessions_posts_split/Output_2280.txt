There have been a lot of amazing relationship confessions on here lately, and it go me hopeful. But we just had a fight, or a disagreement, or whatever you want to call it, and now I feel hallow. You admitted it was your fault, and that I was great to you, but that makes it worse. It means that there is nothing I can do to fix this, and that me being "amazing" is still not enough for you to care about me or my feelings. I guess it is my fault in the end, I wasn't made to be cared about, no matter how hard I tryed.
