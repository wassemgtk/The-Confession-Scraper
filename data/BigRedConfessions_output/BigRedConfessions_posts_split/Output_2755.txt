I sometimes wonder at the similarities between what freshman archies do for D-Day and much of what is termed hazing at Cornell. We're taught, at Delta series, that even activities that seem harmless and that participants purport to engage in willingly can still be hazing. I'm certainly not advocating for hazing--which is often dangerous and, at the very least, can make participants feel uncomfortable, which should not be a factor in joining an organization. I'm just wondering why certain things that we're very careful not to do in the Greek system to avoid any possible accusations of hazing (this is in a sorority, fraternities are different I suppose), archies are free to do in public. If we did half the things they've done in the past week we'd be in trouble for hazing. 

This isn't meant to be an attack on architects because I really believe that everything they're doing is fun and harmless and a great way to bond before their biggest of the year. It's just me musing on the rather draconian way in which Greek activities surrounding new member periods have come to be dealt with.
