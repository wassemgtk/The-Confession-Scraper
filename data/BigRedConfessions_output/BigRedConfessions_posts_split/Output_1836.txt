To the one who wasn't it, let it be known, this is going sound spiteful, but know it's not, its just honest. I'm done with you. On so many levels. I can finally say that and truly mean it. I want nothing to do with you. Romantically, you aren't the same person who was so beautifully strong and open. Your eyes have been distorted, and you are fighting a war that slowly is rotting humanity. That's fine, because like everyone else, you are blind. But unlike everyone else you devour information and act so enlightened, when in reality you are just being dragged around by the powers that be. Your reality is so warped, and it makes me laugh. You fail to truly understand what this world is, just like everyone else, which is so sad since I thought you had so much potential. But that can be forgiven. We all have our flaws. But you just aren't worth my time anymore. To any extent. I won't even waste time burning that bridge, because I rather just walk away and let time hide it. I thought at the minimum we were good friends. I thought there was a level of honesty and openess between us. But you couldn't even tell me to my face, not even as a friend. I thought we were close, but I realized that you so selfishly tried to protect my feelings and hid anything that could have hurt. I'll let you know I'm not hurt. Maybe if I had learned it when my mind was still broken, then so would my heart. But I learned it all when I could breathe without you stepping into my mind. But no matter what it could have done to me, purely as a friend, I deserved to know. But now I understand we were never friends. Just minds that conversed. And for that, I have lost respect in you and want nothing to do with you. I am not a pawn whose emotions you can play with, someone whose admiration you need to keep no matter what the truth was. I came to you so honestly, which such sincerity like never before, and you spat in the face in the one thing I valued most. That's fine with me, since I have found someone beautiful, who makes me happy when I'm with them -not just when I think about them- and I'll give them my whole, because I know they'll do the same for me. You made me realize the one thing I need the most, and the amazingly the next person to step immediately in my life offered it to me so openly. I want loyalty and the truth. You never gave me either. And that's okay. I hope you have a good life. This is the last time I'll think of you, because there is no room for anyone else since they takes so much space in my mind. But that's not because of some stupid idealization that corrupted my sanity, but rather for who she is, because I truly know who that is. 

To the one who makes me so calm it slightly frigthens me, until you, I cursed the time I wasted, but all of that now just makes me truly appreciate that beautiful smile you give me, knowing that you truly care about me just as much as I do for you. And let it be known that your timing couldn't have been better. Any early, and my mind would have been corrupted, unable to fully give you my all, but just as they slipped out, you -someone that honestly deserves to matter- came in. I want to do right by you. I have no eyes for anyone else, because I can trust everything that you are, every word you speak, every step we make. I feel like I can say anything with no fear of the consequences, but you are truly open to who I am, as I am of you. I feel so free being held by you. I smile when I look at you because I have not been this happy in the longest time, and it isn't just because who you are or where I am in my life, but because of who we are together. This feels too right. You don't just check off a list of wants, but rather make my heart with your company. Your essence as a human being. I don't feel forced to make you happy, because doing so just comes so naturally, since all I want is for you to be as happy as I am with you. I dont worry about what I do or say around you, because I know you just want me, imperfections and all. I haven't been this happy in forever, and I am so happy I can bring you the same joy. I never thought I could find someone who could want me as equally as I want them, but here we are, and with such intensity.
