When pet owners can't talk about anything other than what their pets are doing that instant, and giving them constant undivided attention in the presence of other people, it's disrespectful, awkward, and annoying. What's even more annoying is referring to yourself as their mommy or daddy. You didn't give birth to your pet, and they're not substitutes for children. Stop talking to them as if they're people and then getting mad when they didn't understand the full extent of the convoluted comment you threw at them. They don't speak English. Or have a frontal cortex. That's the definition of psychotic behavior.
