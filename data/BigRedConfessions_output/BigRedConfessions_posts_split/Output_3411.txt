Before coming to Cornell, I was ambivalent towards hook-up culture. I thought it was a rational arrangement, both people mutually benefit with no strings attached. Especially once you realize the amount of stress coming your way from classes and the constant problem of figuring-out-what-you-want-to-do, it would take a lot of energy to add a relationship on top of all that. There's the possibility that the person you like is far away from your hometown, person is about to graduate, person is in/not in the greek system, etc, but you still have a burning desire for that person. So, it makes sense why loosely defined relationships are often established. However, the nature of the capricious relationship can also lead to more hurt than if you were to just stay single or in a real relationship. After going through a fwb, I will say it's more trouble than it's worth. In the beginning, it feels like a win-win situation, but it gets harder later on because you or the other person may change their mind, find someone else, want more, etc. In the end, someone or both people always get hurt. It can make you feel really insecure and impair your ability to focus on the rest of your life. Things can get really awkward after it's over, so more stress to deal with. 

Bottom-line, transcend the hook-up culture. People are not objects that you can just play around with, so please value yourself and others. It's more worth your time to find amazing people and cultivate friendships that will last a lifetime or make an earnest effort to begin a relationship with someone. As tempting as it is to give into lust, the satisfaction is ephemeral and doesn't fill you up the way genuine happiness would keep you sane.
