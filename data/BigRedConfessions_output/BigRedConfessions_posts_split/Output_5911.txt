"To the sweetest yet most troubled being I've had the pleasure of meeting:

Let me love you.
I can help you so much more than you think I can.

I've done wrong because I couldn't stand how wrong others have been doing you. I'm sorry.

You are so very valuable. A priceless treasure worth so much to keep right alongside one's heart for the rest of time.

I have so much left to give.
Let me share it with the person I care about most."
