Within the past week I ate four full boxes of Thin Mint Girl Scouts cookies. I am glad I bought 20 boxes in total so that the fascists in the government like Bloomberg and Feinstein don't ban my right to eat highly sugary foods. I support farmers in Asia working the Palm Oil plantations so that they can get their fare share. I hope I won't become fat or become a diabetic, though. :/
