"I posted on here a while ago about my fears that science is now being directed by lucrativity and the potential for a ""glamorous"" paper. This blog post (linked below) from plant science journal sums it up well. Discovery for the fun of it is dying. No one does exploratory studies anymore--just looking around in the world to see what curiosities you might find. Why is this the case? No institution or government organization will provide the funding (despite the comparative cheapness of this work). There's always a chance that you won't find a thing, and, even worse in the eyes of your funding source, you have no idea what you'll find. Most science these days, believe it or not, is done when the researcher has a pretty good idea of the answer. It's not because this is all the researchers want to study, but rather all they could get funding for.

The only solutions I can come up with is for researchers to utilize crowdfunding with sites like Kickstarter. The basic research I'm discussing here is much cheaper than your typical NSF or NIH grant size. Do you smart Cornellians have any ideas? I'm graduating form Cornell in a year, and I really want to be able to do this exploratory science despite the terrible funding climate that exists today.
