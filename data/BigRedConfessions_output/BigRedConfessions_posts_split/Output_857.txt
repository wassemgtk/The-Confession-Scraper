I need to find out who this girl is. She's probably the most beautiful human being I have ever seen. I saw her once in the bus to the Ithaca Mall, once on the bus to NYC for October Break, and around campus walking to class a couple times. Please help me find her. Even if you do, I probably will never have the guts to actually talk to her. But I'm content in admiring her beauty from afar.
Okay so, she has beautiful, porcelain light skin. She has a boy cut, her hair is kind of dark. I'm not exactly sure what color because the times I've seen her, she was wearing a beanie. She dresses like a tomboy - she had sweats but like the skinny sweatpants, like the "jogger" type. I think that's what it's called. Oh, and she wore Vans, the specific ones she wore were called "Sk8-hi slim" and they were black. 
She has such beautiful features, a real classic beauty. 
Wow, I'm reading this back now and I sound like I belong on "To Catch a Predator" or something. I swear I'm not a stalker, every time I saw her I was so excited and surprised that I ran into her. I'm not a stalker, I'm just a little freshman who has never believed in "love at first sight" until now. I have a huge crush on this girl and I just want to know her name. I haven't even spoken a word to her but I wish I did. Anyway, to this mystery girl: you are so beautiful and intriguing and I can tell you have such an interesting and beautiful mind.
I haven't seen her around campus in a while...I hope I can see her at least one more time before break!!! Stay beautiful, mystery girl.
