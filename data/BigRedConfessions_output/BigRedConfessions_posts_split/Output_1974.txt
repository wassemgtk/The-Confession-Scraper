I feel like I'm going to be one of the very few girls that will come out of Cornell as a virgin in college. I was taught to keep my virginity until marriage, but I feel like if I ever fall in love, I will be heartbroken once I tell him my promise... when he leaves me. I feel like I cant trust a guy.
