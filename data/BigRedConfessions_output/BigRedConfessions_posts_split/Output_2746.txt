These last couple of weeks have been so hellish that I just can't handle it anymore. During it all, I was so in the zone that even when I knew I should feel some way, I just couldn't. Or at least not until I took a second to finally breathe, and then I felt it all hit me like a train. I am so tired, have no more energy, yet so many emotions that I can't even fucking rest. It wasn't like my situation was much better before, but shit, I at least felt like I had control. Now my life feels like its going on a downward spiral, and I barely realized how far I already fell. Everything around me is crashing, because I couldn't handle all the weight, but acted like everything was good, as long as I didn't feel any pain. Well here it is. And in the end, I got no one to blame but myself. God my life sucks. I wish I could just find the way up, but everything I want involves contuining down until I come out the otherside. Is it worth it? Can I take anymore? Do I even deserve rest? Or peace? Or happiness? Can I ever be who I NEED to be, or will I always be failing to fill shoes that I am not meant for. I wish I could find a way to live without everything tearing me apart.
