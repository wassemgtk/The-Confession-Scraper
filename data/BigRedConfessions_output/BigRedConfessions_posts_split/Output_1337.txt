I heavily contacted my ex after he broke up with me. I made it a mission to express my emotions or my opinions about him or the break up. Fuck it, I'm young and I can make "mistakes" like these. Fuck this expectation for women to always leave quietly and fuck your ideas of what a strong woman sounds or looks like. Fuck you for reducing me to a vagina that "just needs dick"; because trust me the one thing that I did wrong was associate these good and intellectual ideas about you with your mediocre dick...yeah that's right, don't even try to give yourself the privilege of thinking that your dick was the thing that had me writing to you. Hell NO, your dick and mediocre sex skills was the last thing that I mourned after the break up. Fuck your ideas of strength and fuck your disillusioned ideas about yourself. I told you all that I felt, for me, not for you. And I just want to say that ladies, if you're ever in a situation where a man leaves you, you have all the right to express anger, frustration, etc. Same for the men. You should have the ability to express frustration and anger without them making it about "you wanting them back". You are human so express all that comes with being that. Fuck the angry black woman narrative too, I have a right to express myself with whatever spaces I have the privilege to occupy. *Big middle finger to you* and it's time to clean the mess you should've never had the right to make.
