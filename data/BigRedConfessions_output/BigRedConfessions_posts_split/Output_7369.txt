So it goes like this; I've had one hell of time here at Cornell. Although I've only been here about 6 months, it's crazy to think about how much I have gone through. I failed my first test, got rejected by a beautiful girl, and did not get into the fraternity that I wanted to. Of course there's plenty more but that's not the point. The truth is it hasn't been all that great. However, there's usually a bright side. I have met a few people here whom I can now, honestly call my best friends. What still amazes me today is how the world miraculously brought us together. I really hope that even after this year is over and we all go our separate ways, we remain just as close. I know my time here would have been way crappier if it wasn't for you guys.
