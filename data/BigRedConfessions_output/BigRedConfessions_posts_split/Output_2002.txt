running is the greatest fucking thing ever, would totally recommend if you're depressed
-a depressed person who's been making lots of progress

P.S. if you're just running and trying to get better, if you're getting strongly out of breath before you start sweating you're going way too fast: getting speed takes time if you're not there yet and the  weeks of building up to what you consider "adequate running" is totally worth it once you start getting closer and closer.
