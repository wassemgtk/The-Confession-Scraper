I think I may have chronic bad breath. It's probably why I never have people that want to be friends with me. Today I one of my professors told me, whom I have know for a while and after talking to me in the hallway, that I should have my tonsils removed because they are the reason for the horrid smell. I have never felt more embarrassed in my life at her bluntness. I guess I have tonsil stones and people judge me for it. :( I rather sit in my dorm and cry than go to class.
