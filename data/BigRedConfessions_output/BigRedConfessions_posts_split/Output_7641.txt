National Eating Disorder Awareness Week is next week.
In a way, it marks the sixth year of my evolving eating disorder and I am so sick of being sick. 

Once I stopped recovery for Anorexia Nervosa (the hardest was actually learning to eat again) it became extreme bingeing and now after half a year of that I'm pretty sure it's bulimia. 

I want to badly to stop this whole cycle and reach out and tell my friends but honestly they usually just trigger me in the first place; I feel so utterly alone - I don't even look like I have an ED anymore. Gannett seems unwelcoming and condescending in my opinion. 

I tried so hard and just slipped farther and farther back and I'm miserable with it. As much as I want to stop, I seem to be unable - and all the little voices in my head keep telling me to continue or else obviously I'm a fat fucking failure.
