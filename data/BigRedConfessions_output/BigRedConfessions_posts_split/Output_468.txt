I figured out a solution to help everyone with their dry/chapped private bits during the winter! I grew up in the tropics and have never, ever experienced cold weather before this winter so I was terrified by how dry my lady bits have become. I did a lot of research and figured out that coconut oil - yes, a giant jar of cold-pressed, organic coconut oil (without any additives!) from the Wegman's baking aisle - is the most amazing, hydrating lotion...AND it makes for an incredibly silky, delightfully scented lube for couples who use high-grade toys (and don't use latex or rubber based toys or condoms). I hope this info helps everyone get through the last month or two of this crappy weather!
