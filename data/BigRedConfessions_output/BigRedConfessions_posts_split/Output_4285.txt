"I need someone to talk to.

I have a huge problem where i get too emotionally invested in people...and it disrupts my schoolwork, it disrupts my relationships with my friends, it fucks with my sanity, sleeping schedule, and my ability to function as a proper member of society.

I need help. To be honest I've had this problem for years and years and I've known it but as the last years of Cornell closes in on me it's become apparent that this problem is going to last for a while longer. What do I do??

Getting a girlfriend is not going to solve things. It will be a symptom bandaid as long as she's with me but once the likely breakup comes...I'm going to be dead for a month"
