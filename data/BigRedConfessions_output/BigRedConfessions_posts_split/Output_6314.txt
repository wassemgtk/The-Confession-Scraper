All I ever feel is pain and emptiness. Like every step I make I am alone. I feel worthless and like I don't have a meaningful purpose here at Cornell, let alone in the lives of everyone I know. Everyday is a struggle to get through and though I try to put on a mask in front of others, I can never convince myself that I am happy.
I am not suicidal and I don't wish to kill myself. It's just that sometimes I don't want to live anymore. I guess the burden my death would put on my parents and fear of death itself stops me. I don't mean to alarm anyone, it's just that sometimes I need to vent my frustrations, in one way or another.
