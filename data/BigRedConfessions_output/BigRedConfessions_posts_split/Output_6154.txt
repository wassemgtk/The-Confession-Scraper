"There's a guy that I've been running into all over campus for the past few weeks. I want to approach him but he's out of my league and I have no clue what to say. He keeps on looking at me as well so he either thinks that I'm stalking him or he may be somewhat interested as well.

Either way, I'm probably never going to muster the courage to approach him..."
