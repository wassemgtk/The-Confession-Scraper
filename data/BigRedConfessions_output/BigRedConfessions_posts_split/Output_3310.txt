OMG! this has been an interesting valentine's day. My roomie and I discussed to do something on friday, like hit the movies or grab some delicious dessert. NONE of that shit happened. WHY? her excuse started off w/ "my stomach hurts" yet we hit the dining hall and devoured like 2 plates. i told her i could grab her some tea or something warm. she rejected any sort of warm therapy. it was 9 ish (pm), "Hey, i doubt ill can go out, this tummyache is bad."  Five minutes later, grabs her phone and starts talking to her Bf. BITCH! i turned down my plans with another friend JUST to spend some time with you. I didnt care about the movie or the dessert, i JUST wanted some quality time wit ya, after having a shitty week full of exams. And, TODAY? oh, her Bf came over..... while, I am here doing a paper. Great F**** way roomie! F*** YU! this just makes me realize of how much (rather how little) you value me. thanks.
i wish he would just realize of how of a fake, hypocrite, bitch you are. You are sure not the way that you are around me when you are with him or with your "OTHER FRIENDS." 

nice.
