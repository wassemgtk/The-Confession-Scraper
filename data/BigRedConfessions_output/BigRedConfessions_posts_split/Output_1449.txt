I think I have gangrene on one of my toes and I don't know what to do. I accidentally stabbed my foot with a rusty nail in the woods after taking a swim in one of the local gorges. I was a bit high and under the influence at the time and did not realize what I doing. I went to Gannett a few hours after and they gave me a bandage and some antiseptic, but I guess it didn't work. I hope I don't have to get my foot amputated. I'm scared to go to Gannett again because I might have to hear bad news and I am somewhat embarrassed because it looks really ugly on my toe right now. It would be very sad if I would have to walk on crutches up these hills or sit on a wheel chair and have someone push me up these hills. :(
