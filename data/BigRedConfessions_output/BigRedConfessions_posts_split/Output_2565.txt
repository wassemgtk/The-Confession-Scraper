My friends tell me I am selfish for preparing for something serious like a nuclear exchange. I mean I want to survive if shit hits the fan. My family built a massive bunker in the mountains and are storing large amounts of food, water, and supplies for the scenario. It's my right as a free American to fulfill my pursuit of happiness, which is to feel secure all the time. I'm sorry if shit hits the fan and you're unprepared. You will have to suffer like the rest who don't prepare while I live out the days in my underground bunker with my family and select best friends, which is fully equipped with food, supplies, a drinking water plant, a septic tank, massive generators, fuel storage tanks, along with televisions, telephones, a bathroom and showers, and comy beds. You name it I got it and thought about how to live in style when the end of days come. I even have connections to other fellow "preppers" like me via satellite phones and internet, and a massive mountaintop antenna array that was designed by AT&T to be blast proof and could withstand a nearby nuclear exchange, which connects me to the private satellite network company. I will live through the apocalypse or zombie attack in style. I mean even Cornell said it is possible we could have a zombie apocalypse (some recent study came out and was featured on the website), where massive amounts of people are getting infected by a disease, does not mean people will be eating each other like you see in sci-fi movies like you probably assume because you have no connection to reality. PSA: Do your duty and prep because shit will hit the fan sometime soon, and cities will be the most dangerous place to live in.
