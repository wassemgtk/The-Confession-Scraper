Is it me or are those going into business, specifically investment banking type occupations, living life completely in pursuit of money and not contributing to society? Investment banking does not even contribute to the real GDP of a country. Is there a business person here who can explain your motives because I am extremely judgmental of you all but i don't know your side of the story.
