I'm afraid that I focused so hard on academics in high school that I didn't develop socially. I come out of conversations with acquaintances feeling like a failure because I can't say the right things at the right time, and I just don't know how to stand or what I'm supposed to do. I've never really been in a relationship, and I haven't kissed anyone in 3 years. At Cornell, I want to succeed in more areas of my life than just academics, but I don't think I have the social skills to do so.
