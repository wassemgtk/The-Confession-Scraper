I'm starting to think I'm actually invisible. Two professors have argued that I wasn't present in classes that I did attend. A dining hall worker said she didn't remember swiping me in and said she could check the cameras to see if I was lying (I wasn't). People bump into me on the sidewalks and reach over me or sometimes sit on my things (even me) on the bus. 
I'm either losing my mind or people on this campus are dangerously unaware of the world around them. Either way I'm left feeling terrible that no one notices when I'm there.
