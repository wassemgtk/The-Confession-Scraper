Here goes. I really like you. I know I don't show it, it is not easy for me to wear my heart on my sleeve. I'm not trying to play hard-to-get, that shit sucks, I just cannot read you. I hope something happens before I graduate, which is, frighteningly, right around the corner. It saddens me to think that there may be mutual interest that goes undeveloped (especially when I honestly, rarely crush). It's a waste to connect with someone and then have that bond ripped away simply because of circumstances.
