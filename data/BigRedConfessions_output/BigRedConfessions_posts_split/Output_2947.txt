Cornell made me realize how worthless I am. I am graduating in a couple of months with no job, I am more depressed than when I came into Cornell, and I feel like such a loser. I don't even have any friends since no one keeps any contact with me really. I am so worried that once I leave Ithaca when my lease expires I will be homeless. I don't even know what to do, my family laughs at me about how an "Ivy League Grad" can't find a job. Sometimes I just wish a bus would hit me or that I could just pass out when no one is here and end it. It's not like I matter anyways, I am really worthless since no employer to hire me, I have no friends, and I never even been on a date. I think if I just disappeared no one would even notice because I don't even make a single difference in anyone's life. Sometimes I feel as though I roam the earth unnoticed as if I was invisible.
