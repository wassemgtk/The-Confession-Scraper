"While I'm sure there are plenty of kindhearted individuals at Cornell who don't do this:

It is in no way fair for some people to judge, victimize, and bully others, especially when you can never know what someone else is truly going through, whether it be mental or physical illness. 

A little detail that is meaningless to you may torment someone else for a very long time, causing them much distress or even illness. None of us are made from the same mold-there is no standard reaction to trauma.

So next time you're about to be a follower and bother or make fun of someone, think twice and be a leader-a person who respects others as the HUMANS that they are- REGARDLESS of race/ethnicity, gender, religion, or beliefs. 

And to all of my friends who have suffered as victims of others' words or actions, please take care of yourselves, stay strong, talk to people you trust, keep engaging in your life to the fullest,
 and 
most importantly don't ever forget to be the better person by trying your best to NOT EVER let how badly others treat you define your actions and who you are.

Stay true to YOU, a good you, the best you possible.  

Be not the victim, be the victor.

My best wishes, 
A fellow human
