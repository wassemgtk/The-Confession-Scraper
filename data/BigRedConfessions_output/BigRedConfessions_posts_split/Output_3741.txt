I'm a -more towards the introverted / unsocial side -engineer. As a junior, I've realized all I talk about  with to other engineers is academics. Updates on prelim studying, updates on projects, updates on problem sets.... 

I want to meet more interesting people at Cornell. One of my dreams is to meet 1 or 2 English majors and become good friends with them and start some sort of rap group. I also want to meet more Art majors and make cool paintings and shit (have a few good ideas on paintings but not the skills to make them). Problem is I'm always stuck in Duffield scrambling to get an assignment done. Fucking fuck. 

If you are an Art major who can bring some of my paintings ideas to reality or an English major interested in starting a rap group, please comment below.
