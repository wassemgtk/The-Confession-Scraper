I don't know what to do anymore. I've taken all of the steps to get better...talking to a counselor, medication, etc, but nothing is working and I'm tired. I want to take a mental health leave so badly, but I can't go home, and I would have nothing to do, which would probably just make everything worse. I wish I could just start college over and change every decision I ever made here. Well, only three more years to go...
