I want to start drinking.

I vowed to ignore alcohol and drugs in college due to my incredibly compulsive personality (an addiction to video games growing up, for example), a desire to keep my grades up to personally high standards, and my dad's own destructive alcoholism. But honestly, after going to college parties for a good two months every weekend, I've seen that my personality is useless in a party setting. I'm known to act as an idiot during "fun times", but I'm actually very calculated in my stupidity: like, I try to evaluate the social gains and losses brought upon by every comment I make and every action I do. In a party, I can't hear people due to the blaring music and I can't see anything due to the crowd. Sensory disorientation prevents me from evaluating my situation, so I reason it's beneficial to be totally impulsive in this kind of situation, which I couldn't do unless my personality were changed for the better. This is where drinking comes in.
