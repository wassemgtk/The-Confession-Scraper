Graffiti is not a hard thing for Cornell to get rid of. The importance of social change in a nation coming from universities is priceless. If you bitch about the messages that are being pushed through unconventional methods, you care more about a completely minuscule and irrelevant amount of campus tuition (meanwhile the administration wastes millions on way less important stuff, which no one seems to complain about) than a real social issue.
