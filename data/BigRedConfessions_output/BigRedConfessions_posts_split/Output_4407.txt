I've never had sex in the stacks. As a matter of fact, I've never had sex! But I have masturbated in maaannny places throughout campus, New York City, Long Island, my bedroom, and my mom's basement maaaaannnyy times. Does that count as an accomplishment? Bc I think that's what got me into Cornell. Yay me. #LifeIsSoAwesome
