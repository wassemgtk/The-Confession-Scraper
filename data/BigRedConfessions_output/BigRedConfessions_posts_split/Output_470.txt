In my experience a person's attractiveness is inversely proportional to the likelihood they'll respond to your message. Or really their willingness to interact with you or other people in any context. I apologize if this is offensive, but it's been the single best predictor of a person's behavior. The very rare exception is if their attention is asked by someone who is similarly attractive, but that's no guarantee. Similarly, the less attractive a person is, the easier they are to interact with.
