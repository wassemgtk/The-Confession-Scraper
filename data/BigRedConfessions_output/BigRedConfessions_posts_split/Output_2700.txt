I once fell for a girl who I genuinely grew attracted to for qualities that I came to know of after spending some time with her. There are things like certain mannerisms that you may notice and smile about but can't openly say that you appreciate without coming off as weird. Just how society works. She was truly one of a kind and I loved her. Of course, I thought she was good looking too. 

I have a gut feeling for what she may actually think of me but there's no way of knowing for sure. Right now, based on how so many "conversations" went in the past it just seems like she was never interested. I thought she hated me longest time. After all the shit I told her, I have no way of saying anything more to her. And that's what my friends advised me to do. Just stop what I'm doing and forget about it because it's just a bad idea and can only end badly if not worse. 

What I did was probably one of the most irrational things I ever did. I was so stubborn and tried to go for something that I knew couldn't work. I feel that I won't regret what I sent her because I ended up telling her how I felt, even though I did it in a such a bizarre way and with some exaggeration of details. I feel really bad for having bothered her when she's in such a busy stage of her life. Maybe if I stopped trying to talk to her after when I saw her last, things wouldn't be where they are now -- broken.
