I always say inappropriate things, thinking they will be funny, and then no one laughs and people just kind of look at each other awkwardly and then I feel so embarrassed. I'd say a good 70% of my interaction with people is cringe-worthy embarrassment and awkwardness, and things I struggle to forget for days after but there are so many of them, alas, that it's actually difficult to feel bad for all of them, so luckily the old stuff gets buried quickly. And I know you'll say we all have those moments, we all do those things... No... You have no idea.
