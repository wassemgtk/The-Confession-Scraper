I really shouldn't feel lonely; I have friends and family that love me and will always be there for me. I shouldn't feel sad, and yet, I still do. 

I really shouldn't feel sad. I know I shouldn't let the fact that all the relationships I've had ended with the guy leaving me bring me down. I shouldn't blame myself for them leaving me, and yet, I still do. 

I really shouldn't blame myself. It's okay to be alone, and being alone does not mean I am a lesser person. I shouldn't question my self-worth because I am alone, and yet, I still do.

I really shouldn't question yet my self-worth. I know what happens when people do, and I have put the past behind me. I now smile confidently and embrace the world. I shouldn't feel alone, and yet, I still do.
