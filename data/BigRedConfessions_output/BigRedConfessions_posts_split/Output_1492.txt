I am a senior premed and I am slightly panicking right now. All my colleagues are constantly absent from my classes while I am still waiting for more medical school interview invitations. I applied relatively late in the cycle (September mostly) and I think I am screwed. Part of me really wants to withdraw my application and reapply next cycle, but the larger part of me says to keep trying, because I refuse to give up without trying my best. As a doctor I will fight for my patients' lives to the very end as well!
