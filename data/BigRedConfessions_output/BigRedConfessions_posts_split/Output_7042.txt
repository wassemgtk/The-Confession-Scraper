To the girl who walked past me in Uris hall at about 1:15 on Friday whispering to herself "I can't do this." It'll all be okay!!! I wish I could've stopped you to say that to you directly but you walked by so quickly. I hope whatever it is you did it and you rocked it and got through it. You've got this.
