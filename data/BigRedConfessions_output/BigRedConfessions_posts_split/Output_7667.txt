"I'm going on dates and hooking up with guys because I'm over you now, but I'm not crazy over any of them, and it makes me wish that I wasn't over you because I so miss being completely, hopelessly in love.  I miss the joy, the comfort, the intimacy, and yes, even the absolute pain I was in to get over you.  It sucks knowing that when I see you, I'll feel a twinge of annoyance and nothing else.

I miss missing you.
