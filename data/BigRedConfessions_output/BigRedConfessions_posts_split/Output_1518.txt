I have noticed a lot of guys have very bad perceptions of women and dating. A lot of the times, it's the guys who have not gone out with many women seem to blame women for it. Just FYI, saying "girls don't like me, they only like assholes" is about the most asshole thing you could say and provides a pretty good reason as to why women would not like you. Claiming that you are entitled to women liking you and wanting to be with you is just plain wrong. It is a form of sexism and misogyny and is ridiculous. If you see a woman you are interested in: try to talk to her pleasantly or go about your day. Just don't say "what is her problem? she should like me!", because no one is SUPPOSED to want to be with you if they don't want to.
