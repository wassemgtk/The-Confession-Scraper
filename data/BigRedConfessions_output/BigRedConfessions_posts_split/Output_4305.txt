I wish it were normal to tell random people here at Cornell how amazing of people they seem to be. Their incredible independence, intelligence, kindness, all of it. So many people here have these insecurities about how they look, finding love, doing academically well. I just wish they could all see in themselves what I see in them. It's all of you that makes me so proud to say I go to Cornell. It's all of you that makes Cornell what it is. Each of you are so unique, and that's why you're here. Be proud of everything that you are :)
