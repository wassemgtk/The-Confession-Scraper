Why do college students have to drink so much?  It can really be a lot of fun to just have a couple drinks in one night but many of my "friends" feel the need to go overboard every weekend.  I don't understand how you find it fun to get drunk to the point that you black out or throw up.  Binge drinking is unhealthy, excessive, expensive, and it can harm a lot of people other than yourselves.  Just think on that.
