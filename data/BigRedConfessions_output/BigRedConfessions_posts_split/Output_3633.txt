I currently live in a certain program house and absolutely hate it. Everyone is in a greek or cultural organization, and it's isolating when you are in neither. And I don't want to feel pressured to join these organizations just so that I can make friends, because they are almost like cults. People told me that the community was inclusive and that everyone got along, but I have never felt so lonely in my life. I wonder if it is because I do not fit their mold of what a minority individual should be like; because I do not partake in these organizations, people have even called me "white-washed" or worse. But I am every bit proud of my culture as them. When I go back home, I am isolated for the color of my skin, and here, in my own dorm, I am isolated for "whiteness" of my thoughts. I am not going to apply for the in-house lottery next semester, because I hate this feeling of being an outsider. Better to be unknown than to be ignored.
