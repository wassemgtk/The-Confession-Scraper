I realized why I'm a decent or good boyfriend today. It's because whenever I'm single I have no idea what the fuck I'm doing. Do I go for it? How do I read the signs? So when I find a girl I really like I hold on and make sure there's no chance in hell of fucking it up. And because of all of the (perceived) rejection when I'm single I think there's no way I can be good enough, supportive enough, good enough in bed, whatever. And the stress of that is what eventually starts to tear at an otherwise perfect relationship. Love conquers all, but if you worry about it constantly and are always second-guessing yourself then what's the point? I just wish that I could eliminate that worry from my life, but after 7 years of being the nice guy cast aside, what can I realistically train myself to do differently? I want to be the best version of myself and not be worried. I want it for me, but I find myself wanting it for her even, which just adds to the pressure.
