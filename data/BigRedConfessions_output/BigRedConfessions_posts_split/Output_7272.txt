to the girl who sat on the benches of olin roof today for hours by herself, the girl wearing the floral dress with tights, i wanted to let you know that you're beautiful. the way your honey brown hair swayed in the wind caught me off guard. i wanted to say hi, hello, ask your name, or even smile, but i didn't even think i could get the words out. i hope i see you again there soon /:
