I do this weird thing when I'm a state of semi-dreaming/semi-awake where I want to conduct a test to see if there's a chance what just happened in my dream (which is usually AMAZING/exactly what want to happen to me) is actually real. While I'm in that state I'm not sure what's real yet, so I have to test it. So I send an email to myself in the dream, thinking if I receive the email, it means this actually happened in the real world. Then I start to think - mind you STILL not being sure what's real! - "Okay, let's think rationally here. You're in your bed. Can an email that you send in your head actually somehow connect to the Internet and be sent"? Then what happens is I think more and more about it and slowly convince myself it can't be real, both through deductive reasoning and through slowly starting to wake up and realize dreams aren't real. That's then followed by disappointment and the beginning of another lonely day.
