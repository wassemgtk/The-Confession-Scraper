I approach my TAs for help when they're at their weakest, when they are most visibly stressed, when they are overwhelmed and tired and just want to get away from their students and go to sleep. That way they always give me answers without bothering with explanations or trying to walk me through anything.

Thank you TAs. I really do love you.
