"I want to express a couple of concerns in regards to the English language here at Cornell.

Cornell, being an Ivy League, welcomes students from all over the world, with different backgrounds, cultures and native languages. All seem to go along well except for one: Difference in native languages resulting in different accents of the English language.

In the two semesters I have here at Cornell, besides being a transfer student from a US school and still not fluent in English, I have seen lots of people underestimating others just because of their level of English. I only have 3 years learning/speaking English, and I think I have learned it pretty quick. However, I don't let anyone hold me down anymore. 

I just want to get across two points: 

     If you don't know a second language, please do not make comments like ""Can you speak English?"" or ""Your English is not good"". You have no idea what it is to go to another country to a university where the language used is a language you never learned/spoke before. Many times have I struggled in my classes just because I don't understand the material yet I try very hard to remain on the boat. If you take any foreign languages, try to visit the country where the language is spoken and hold various conversations with as many people. You will notice how challenging it is. PLEASE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT BESIDES OF OUR SPEAKING ABILITIES OF ENGLISH, WE ARE IN THE SAME OR EVEN HIGHER ACADEMIC POSITION YOU ARE.

     My second point is that you have to understand that we are not really interested in learning English. Many of us, including me, are forced to learn English just because we want a degree from a prestigious university. My native language is Spanish, and I am totally fine with it and proud of it. Surely English opens doors worldwide, but I think my English is good for day-to-day communication and I am not interested in getting the ""American"" accent or become fluent in it. I DO NOT WANT TO GET RID OF MY ACCENT AND FORGET MY NATIVE LANGUAGE. So please, be kind to others who are English as a second language students. "
