I am Asian-looking born in Latin America and I was never into Asian girls because they weren’t in my friendship circles. My experience was limited to white, latinas, ebony, etc. But by occasion, I am dating an Asian now and I am really enjoining her.  It’s funny, I see Asian girls with other eyes now.
