You will never, ever get that, because what you "thought" you could have never existed. No matter how much you try to lie to yourself, this man will always and forever be that man who abandoned you when you needed him most, the man who decided on a whim he didn't love you, the man who cheated on you. He will never, and can never, be the man you hoped he could be. NO amount of wishing will make him so. NO amount of lying to yourself will erase this. He didn't try. It doesn't matter if he "realizes it now". You're either someone who talks with their partner, or a coward who does what they want and then ask for forgiveness after you're hurt someone you claim to love.
