I overdosed antidepressants and sleeping pills yesterday. It's my second time doing that in this week. I can't say that I tried to kill myself because I obviously knew it won't kill me. But I wanted something to break this endless circle, wanted something bad to happen and ruin me. I've been through all different kinds of pressure and stress that typical American students will never imagine, and that are hundred times worse than my life here. But I have no idea why I'm breaking down in the worst level ever right now in Cornell.
