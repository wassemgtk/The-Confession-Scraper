so an event has been recently shared on cornell groups and one of the panels/workshops sounds very familiar
 "Cornell Won't Save You: Politics of Respectability"  
where was the last time I read this?
oh yeah right on those graffiti that littered campus during winter break. I wonder if they are connected to that vandalism or maybe is just a coincidence (ha)
