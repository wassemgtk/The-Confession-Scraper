@2248:  Have a safe word and set boundaries early.  Take it slow, and just ease yourself into it.  The point here is to be safe and enjoy yourselves, and have the kinky sex be stimulating, so understand what you are and are not comfortable doing, communicate that to her, and at the risk of redundancy, HAVE A SAFE WORD.  Finally, give it a shot.  In a safe environment, engaging a fantasy like this could be fun for both parties, and if you find yourself not liking it, then you can always switch back to normal stuff.  Communicate, be open, and have fun!

I'm posting this as a confession because I'd rather not let my identity out...I feel a bit shy about openly sharing my knowledge on this stuff.
