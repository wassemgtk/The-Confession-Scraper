Doing a Master Engineering here. All I'm paying for is the name and I won't get any actual education out of it. The whole place is filled accomplished people who don't know how to teach and the program is completely unhelpful in terms of the course requirements. 95% of material I already knew and I know classmates feeling the same way. Whole place is a facade.
