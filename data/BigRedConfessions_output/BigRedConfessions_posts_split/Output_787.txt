I am a premed who graduated from Cornell with honors in 3.5 years and I have a 3.875 GPA. I also struggle with depression and paranoia. I constantly feel that I am inadequate and worry about failure. Also, no one in my family cares about my professional aspirations and they are constantly nagging me to snatch up a husband from Cornell because they believe that marriage soon after college is the ideal path for a young woman. I tried very hard to secure a boyfriend for the past 3.5 years but I had trouble maintaining all my long term boy relationships. I am worried that something is inherently wrong with my character, perhaps I should be more passive, more compromising, more loving. Perhaps I should smile more, dress up better, and voice less of my opinions. Many of my family friends are professional women in their 30s and cannot get married, so I am worried that this might happen to me. I am really scared.
