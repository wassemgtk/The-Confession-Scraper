"I just wanna talk to you again and get to know you better.

I actually enjoyed talking to you that one night. And not just because you seemed flirty, but because you actually seemed like an interesting person, and I like getting to know interesting, new people. But now we seem to almost ignore each other in person, and never text even though you asked for my number. I realize this is as much my fault as yours, but I really wanna change that if you're willing to.

But I'm afraid that any attempt I make to spend time with you (which I did once and failed because you were busy) will be construed as me ""chasing"" you. I remember overhearing your friend use that term--that you had ""multiple guys chasing you""--and I believe she was counting me as one of those guys. The truth is I really don't know you well enough to know if I'd want to ""chase"" you. So in the mean time, can't we just get to know each other a little bit better before worrying about that kind of stuff?
