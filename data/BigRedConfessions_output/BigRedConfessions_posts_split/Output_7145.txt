Had a really nice conversation with a beautiful girl who I just (Tuesday 2...pm) met in Kennedy Hall, while waiting for my Human Bonding class to start. She seriously made my evening. Never be afraid to strike up a convo with a stranger... I really wanted to ask for your number, but after you said you are waiting for a friend, I immediately thought, "boyfriend. " Anyhow,  I hope to see you around, from the guy using both outlets.
