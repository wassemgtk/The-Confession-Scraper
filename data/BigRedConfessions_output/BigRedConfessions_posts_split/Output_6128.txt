My best friend's ex wants to bang me. She keeps texting me early morning/late night, liking my pictures and trying to set hangouts. I thought she was just being nice, but she doesn't even talk to my friend anymore. As Barney Stinson says: "Bros before hoes"... I'll keep turning her down (wtf am I doing, she's so hot!)
