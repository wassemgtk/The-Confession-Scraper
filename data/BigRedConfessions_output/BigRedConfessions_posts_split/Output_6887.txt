"I'm a senior and I barely have any friends here. The friends I had - didn't really care. They said they did, but they didn't. And it became obvious when they didn't bother - even when I did. Well, there's only so many times you can ask the same person to hang out with you before you realize that they don't really give a shit. And only so many times you can think about them calling you their ""best friend"" for two months followed by six months of not having time for you.

People really suck. All I've ever wanted is somebody to do absolutely nothing with. Why is that so fucking hard to find?"
