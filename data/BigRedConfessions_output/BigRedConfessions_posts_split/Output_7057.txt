"it seems like part of the tradition for slope day is for people to complain endlessly about the artists. I have certainly been guilty of this in the past but this year I'm actually really excited.

For everyone saying ludacris hasn't been relevant in forever, who cares?  I'm willing to wager you still know the lyrics to Rollout, What's Your Fantasy, Get Back, Act a Fool, Money Maker, etc. dude has mad flow. If you're not hyped now, you might see things differently when your drunken slope day self regresses to the middle school dance glory days of music. 

Maybe you haven't heard of Matt and Kim. You should check them out. Or not. Doesn't really matter because they are fantastic live and know how to put on a show. They always bring a ton of energy and are perfect for a concert like slope day. 

Either way anyone who's experienced slope day knows the concert is only a fraction of the fun. Cheers to fun and friends!
