I'm confused about the MillionStudentMarch... The demands are so mindblowingly dumb that I’m not sure if this is supposed to raise awareness for the fact that students are in debt or if it's something like make huge demands so that they meet you half way. I'm blown away that people actually believe in these demands. If you know any economics then you would know that these demands are insane. The movement might as well be called: “let us go to school for free and pay us while you’re at it and oh, also take a hit in your endowment by divesting.” 

I know you'll bring up Scandinavian countries that provide free education but let us not forget their insane tax rates.
