so, after close to a year of meeting this someone and texting, and out of nowhere stopped texting.
I finally had the guts (for once and for all) send him a message. After telling myself that a phone works both ways and shit, idk why i had the audacity to finally send a message. I did, this 'special' someone only replied once and like 6 hours later..
Thanks. i now realize how much (or little) you cared and made me believe (or i made myself believe..?)
That is it from me; i wont send more msgs. I am done. good luck with everything and i wish you the best....
