Okay. I will say something...

My entire life I have always been comfortable with my body. I haven't had anything or anyone that makes me question whether I want to look differently just to "fit in". But ever since I discovered that I have a thing for men (I struggled with sexual orientation mostly; dated girls only), I decided to get the app many gays get: Grindr. My life hasn't been great after I got Grindr. Guys there expect you be either a twink or someone very muscular; it sucks. Also, as I am very inexperienced, many guys pressure me to either hook up with them so they can be my "first" or are rather not interested. I know it's a hook up app but is there an app for beginners?

Going back to the typical body that a guy must have to be successful with guys on Grindr, it makes me sad when I constantly get rejected. I have been successful with girls before and they never minded my body... mainly because I have other traits that balance out the equation at the end. What I have seen is that those traits don't really matter for guys on Grindr. If you don't have an amazing body, they go like "do you have big C?". I usually don't answer those questions because it's very shitty to like someone for just one thing. So I rather just stop talking to that person. 

The reason I complain about this is that it's very frustrating for me. I want to have fun since I'm in College and I know that after I graduate I will settle but it's hard to have that kind of fun if you are not out and don't have a gay app. As a result, I am hating being gay and I am worried that as a result of that, I end up hating myself. I don't know what to do or who to talk to. I feel like if I ever tell this to anyone, I'd be judged and left out and then everyone would know. I hardly trust anyone so that doesn't help either. 

P.S. I am currently working on my body (not for the assholes on Grindr) but I said this because of those that are different in any other way.
