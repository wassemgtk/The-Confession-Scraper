"I don't really know why I'm doing this- any of this. It sort of feels like the only reason is because I don't have another choice. I get out of bed because I have to when some days all I actually want to do is hibernate until it's winter break and I can go home where people actually care. Well, I suppose some people care here, when they notice. People who have known me longer are better at seeing through when I'm just going through the motions or are more inclined to call me on it and check in.
It's exhausting, a never-ending dance of problem sets, lab reports, work, grading, projects, and more that would readily identify me to anyone reading this. I'm exhausted. Such a funny word in how appropriate it seems to be. I have no energy, not motivation, no WHY I'm doing this. I'm not sure if I've had a why in a while. Which logically I realize is the crux of the matter, but it's really hard to look for light in a dark room when the how is all but physically crushing you into the floor. But, again, no other option really. I'm not suicidal, not even close. I'm tired, but I've no desire to be dead. And repulsed at the thought of what it would do to my family and close friends. Though admittedly I'll have morbid thoughts about if anyone here would mourn me if I died in an accident or something like that. I know they'd notice, but I'm not so sure very many people here would actually miss me.
So I keep going. And going. And for what? A Friday night where I can have a few hours of not-so-free freedom because my brain is nagging me over that e-mail needing to be written and then crying for hours because it just doesn't feel like everything I'm putting in is equating to anything. My life isn't exactly functioning at the Carnot efficiency right now. I've gotten maybe 25 hours of sleep since Sunday, a lot of junk food from some stressed out cravings for carbs, and even more work for this weekend out of the deal.
And I get that my life is nowhere near as hard as a LOT of people's. But to deny that I'm in pain because others are in worse is to deny anyone the right to feel pain or joy because someone else always has it worse or better.
I'm also realizing how incoherent this all really is but give no shits. I'm not even sure that there's a point to me writing this, except maybe I haven't given up hope entirely and am praying there's some small sense of catharsis. Something besides the stupor I'm hiding in because right now reality pretty much sucks.
Geez, I really can't give up hope entirely, because there's no way I can allow this to end on a completely hopeless note (though hope seems to be making the situation a hell of a lot worse). But I can't say I know what lesson, if there is one, can be learned here, whether it's one for you or me. Or maybe I just don't want to admit it. One of my greatest weaknesses is fear of being vulnerable or out of control- it's really what isolates me from other people. It's why I'm throwing this away into the depths of the Internet where Cornell Confessions isn't going to post it rather than confiding in a friend. I guess what I need to learn, and probably a lot of other people at Cornell, is that in order for people to be in your lives, you do have to let them in.You have to admit when it's going to be hard rather than forging on pretending that it will be easy. You have to ask for help. You have to admit to yourself that you are scared because, really, only then can you be brave enough to take it on and take it down. Here's hoping I and everyone, everywhere, is able to do just that.

P.S. Yes, CAPS appointment is scheduled. I was hesitant because I don't know that it helped before."
