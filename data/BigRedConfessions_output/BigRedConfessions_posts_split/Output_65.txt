To be honest to me make-up is a real turn off. I think almost everyone is vain to an extent, but literally trying to mask your face just don't sit right in my stomach. Yah I understand people need to love themselves in their own way, but for those who are make-up free, keep rockin it. For those who put make-up on "I hope that you don't take it wrong".
