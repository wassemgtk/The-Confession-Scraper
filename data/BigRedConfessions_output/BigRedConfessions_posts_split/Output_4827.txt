I don't know if I want to be with my girlfriend any more. I thought I loved her but summer draws people apart, especially with long distance. There's even another girl who I have a little crush on. 
But at the same time the happiest parts of my days are when I talk to my girlfriend and I still see her as my best friend. What do I do??!
