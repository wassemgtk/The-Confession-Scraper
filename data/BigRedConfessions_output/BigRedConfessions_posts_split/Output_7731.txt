You are my roommate, and I can live with you, however there are a few things we should get straight. When you talk to me, do not follow me around our apartment and trap me in a corner breathing your organic food breath into my face. You do not respect personal space and it is unnerving. You also seem to have trouble with eye contact. I know my boobs are big, but I can see your eyes dropping down to them when we talk. Either be more inconspicuous or stop all together. Finally, talk less. I'm never in the room because I cannot stand to listen to your nasally voice tell meaningless stories that never end. I'm so glad you're gone for the week, finally some peace and quiet.
