I'm a very independent person and I have no problem doing things by myself. But I'm looking for a partner to experience life with, to laugh with, and to pass the time with. It seems unfair to me that so many others are given this precious privilege while I am left to wonder what I'm doing wrong.

I don't need someone but I very much want a partner in my life, and it is a unique situation in that there's nothing I can do about it. The lack of control upsets me. Normally when I want something there is a clear pathway for me to get it. I wanted to get into a good college, so I studied harder. I wanted to lose weight, so I worked out more. There is no linear pathway here and I don't know what to do except just continue to live my life. But I've done that for two years here now, and I'm still alone...
