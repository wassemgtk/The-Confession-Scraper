""the thought that my mind has always been the same yet people treat my ideas differently because of how I look is rather discouraging.""

Your mind isn't the same though. Before you were ""hyperfocused on living inside your mind"" and now you're not.

The simple truth is that being overweight correlates heavily with a ton of other stuff that people generally don't like. The causal links or lack thereof are irrelevant, an overweight person is more likely to have low self esteem, lack self control or a weak work ethic, and have less friends.

I can respect the argument that we should accept these flaws and try to treat people equally, because fitness correlates strongly with socioeconomic background and therefore discriminating based on it is regressive. But in the individual case when you lose a bunch of weight, of course people are going to treat you better. You've just shown yourself to be much stronger than you seemed before."
