I've been feeling depressed lately because of the long distance relationship I'm in. I went through a rough last semester with communication problems, there were times we wouldn't talk for days, where we would bottle up our feelings and not mention any issues we were having until we blew up on eachother. Because of that, I was upset a lot trying to get him to open up, especially since communication was all we had. I would party and flirt with guys to get him off my mind. I had made a lot of mistakes and decided this semester would be a start new for us. Over winter break we discussed that we would work better on our communication to help the relationship, and now the new semester is here and I feel the same process happening again. I'm closing myself up to people again and I spend nights just missing him, crying randomly. It doesn't help that I see him only a couple times a year since he doesn't live where I live. And it doesn't help that we have communication problems. Sometimes I wonder why I decided to stay in this, sometimes I feel so mad at myself for what I did last semester and how I feel the same cycle creeping up on me. But the way we feel about each other... it makes me feel like going through with the relationship is absolutely worth it. He is genuinely so compassionate, kind, loving, and when I see him I just fall in love all over again. I just wish he would open up more and I wish that I wasn't so depressed about it. I'm scared about the future.
