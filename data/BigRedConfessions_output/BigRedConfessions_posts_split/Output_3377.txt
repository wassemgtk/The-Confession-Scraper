I'm bi but I don't know how to tell my friends. I know they'll be accepting but I'm still afraid... 

Also, generally: I feel like even though I'm definitely accepting of people who are lgbtq I am afraid of expressing that I am myself. How do I get over this?? I feel like I'm lying all the time... Shoutout to the phrase 'girl crush'
