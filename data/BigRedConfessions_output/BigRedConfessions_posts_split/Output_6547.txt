You told me that I should be more of a bitch so that's exactly what I'm doing: being more of a bitch. I think you failed to realize that I'm not actually a nice person. I'm just kind to the people I care about and who care about me. But I'm a terrible person to have as an enemy and it sucks for you that you're going to have to learn that the hard way.
