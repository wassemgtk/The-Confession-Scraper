"The past few weeks have had a few rough spots for me. Nothing too awful or earth-shattering, but my dad has been in and out of the hospital. And I've been thinking about my plans for the future, and what I want to do after my undergrad years, and what I'm gonna do this summer, and how the crippling debt this institution will leave me with might hinder my future plans. Then there's just the day-to-day accumulation of schoolwork and responsibilities for other organizations. I guess it'd all been starting to stress me a little.

But there was something about the chimes playing and the relatively nice weather this morning and the fact that about 6 friends and acquaintances from totally different circles passed me in rapid succession, each greeting me cheerfully. It sounds sappy and melodramatic, but I kinda fell in love with the world again for a little while. I should try to do that more often."
