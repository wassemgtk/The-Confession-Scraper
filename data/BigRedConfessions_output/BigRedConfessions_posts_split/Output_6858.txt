"If anyone in the Class of 2018 is reading this post and is in the unique position of making that difficult decision between Michigan and Cornell for engineering, choose Michigan. I'm not being sarcastic, or kidding, or even denouncing Cornell's engineering program. Cornell Engineering is very prestigious. But so is Michigan. Even more prestigious if you choose to look at rankings, and especially if you're not from the East coast. But choose Michigan. If I could redo it, I would've chosen Michigan 100 times over. Comment and we can chat. I can clear things up for you.
