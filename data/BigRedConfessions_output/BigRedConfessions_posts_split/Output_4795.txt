I feel like I do have demons inside me (figuratively speaking). There's just a part of me that I feel is absolutely terrible.  It keeps me from getting too close to people, whether they're friends or boyfriends.  That part of me does terrible things to scare them away because I don't want them to hurt me...and then I really hurt myself in the process because I lose people who are important to me. They don't realize how much it hurts. And I hate myself more than they ever could.  And that pain and self-loathing is really hard for me to shoulder because I'm weak. So fucking weak.
