Squatting 3 times a week for the past 8 months, I've developed a minor knee issue. Turns out my form is lacking a bit due to weak adductors. So as a result I've had to use the machine where you sit and you spread your legs and bring them together again. As a guy, it's a bit embarrassing to use that. And if I may give you a valuable piece of advice - DO NOT make eye contact with anyone ever while using that.
