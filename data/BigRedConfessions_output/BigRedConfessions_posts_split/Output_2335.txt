I doubt that some "experts" claiming to help people with their research never had real sympathy on who they're going to help out, just doing for their own honors. Some doing cool stuff to "improve health/behavior/performance" may never had experience on how physical/mental health problems destroy life. And those who are struggling never had a chance to get involved in these projects, or even being ignored directly by the elites, passing by on campus. Yes, opportunities  need ABILITY, not will. But the world is still cruel. Some people are suffering not because of their own fault, but they have to afford it themselves.
