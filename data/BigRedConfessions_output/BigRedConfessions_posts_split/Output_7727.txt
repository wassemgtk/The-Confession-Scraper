It drives me crazy when fellow students blow off their studies. My family is barely scraping together the money to send me to Cornell, my dream school; I am obligated to work hard to justify their sacrifice. While drinking and partying is part of college life, at the end of the day we're here to study what we love. We're here to find that fire, that subject that we're passionate about, and to pursue those flames for the rest of our lives. Don't get caught up in the petty partying and forget to find what drives you. This is it, guys. We have 4(ish) years at this amazing school and then that's it. Don't you ever forget how lucky you are to be here.
