I'm a virgin. Ok? There. I said it. I'm a 23 year old male virgin. You know what? I don't care what you think about me you judgmental piece of shit. It's my life and I chose to be this way. Not because I'm ugly, not because I'm awkward around girls. It's because I prioritize my needs and desires and I believe in waiting for the right one. So FUCK OFF dad.
