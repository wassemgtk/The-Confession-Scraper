Well, Cornell, it is remarkable how in all my time here I have never made friends close enough to discuss things that weigh me down. I've discussed other people's problems with them but haven't been comfortable enough to share the worst ones. There are things we are destined to bear alone perhaps.

Leaving home was awesome for many reasons. I felt a little like young Harry Potter, for whom Hogwarts was the first place he could truly belong to and call his own. (Yes, to all you Cornell haters, you're going to miss it when you are gone). It's not that I had a rough chidhood, quite the opposite. It's just that I had to parent myself way too often. My dad was alright, but my mom was...is weird. She is this weird mix of orthodox religious and narcissist that she has trouble making and keeping friends and views pretty much all people with disgust (not religious enough) or pity (oh they care so much about non-god stuff). I don't hate her, but I gave up on having a close relationship with her long ago. Discussing people from school would just lead into a discussion of whether they made straight A's or their parents' denominations. I Had to get perfect A's too, else how would I do well? No summer camps or extra jobs or sports, just work on your studies. She drove away all the dates I brought home by being generally crazy to them. 

Well I'm at Cornell now, and I think I'll do well for myself. I realized after coming here that I did inherit her traits (an insufferable conviction that I'm better than other around me, for example), and I have worked on becoming a better person and developing healthy relationships with others. My current SO will probably not meet her more than a few times, as this one is too dear to me.

I know many of you have had a hard time coming here, many of you escaped worse lives than this. I hope you find it in you to not hate others because of things you have seen, but to become better people due to all these experiences. I just wanted to get this off my chest. 

(As for that SO, rings may be involved soon if you get what I mean)
