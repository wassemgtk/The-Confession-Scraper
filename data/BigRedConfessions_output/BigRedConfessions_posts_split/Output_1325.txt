Many people say that college is about finding yourself. I have definitely found myself in these 4 years. I'm quiet and shy and depressed. I'm addicted to pain. I like it. I'm not talking about self-harming. I don't do that. I'm talking about emotional and psychological pain. I look forward to rain and cloudy weather because it makes me feel sad and I like it. I get really pissed off when its sunny. I take a lot more credits than I can handle. I don't do great in those classes. I do ok but the point is I stay busy. If I don't, I find myself getting into destructive habits like being drunk every day, smoking cigarettes, and doing drugs. When I take a lot of classes, I'm constantly doing work. I sleep 3 to 4 hours a night, don't eat, and pretty much just survive on caffeine. These habits are less destructive than the other ones so I just go with it. Plus its not like I have any friends to hang out with so doing work distracts me from all that. This past summer I worked two jobs. I don't even have that many student loans. I worked just because. I wanted a third job but my parents stopped me. I always hope that I would get into a fight with someone so they can beat me up. I want the pain. That's all life is and the sooner you accept that, the better it is. I'm scared I won't find a job where I can work 70 hrs/wk. I'm scared what will happen if I have free time in the real world. I don't even care if it pays well. I just want to work myself to death sooner rather than later. Something to escape sedate me while I live this meaningless existence. People on here are always like you should message me to talk. That's very sweet of you people but I'm too far gone. No one can do anything. And the truth is I would never be able to talk about this in person. When I think about how much this place has changed me, it really surprises me. I wasn't like this in high school. In college, all my "friends" drifted apart and I realized how hard it is to actually make decent friends. Soon after, I stopped trying because its really pointless. I can't wait to graduate and forget about these 4 years which probably have been the darkest of my life so far. I have promised myself to come back here at least once a year to reminisce because no matter how much I hate this place it made me into who I am today. And you can't forget what made you and who you really are.
