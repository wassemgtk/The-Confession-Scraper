I am just tired of feminism. When will we stop this victimization of women and start to fight for real equality?

"I’m in favor of men’s liberation as long as you define it as equal opportunity and equal responsibility for both sexes, and I’m also a feminist when feminism is in favor of equal opportunity and responsibility for both sexes. And I oppose both movements when either says: “Our sex is the oppressed sex, therefore we deserve rights”. This is not gender liberation, is gender entitlement."
