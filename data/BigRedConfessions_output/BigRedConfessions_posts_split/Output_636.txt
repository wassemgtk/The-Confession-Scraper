I see all the hatred on this page and I really don't understand it. I realize that everyone's experiences are different and valid, but I'd just like to throw some positivity out there and say that for the first time in my life, I feel like I am where I am supposed to be, and that I belong. I can't wait for the next semester to start, and I'm looking forward to everything the rest of my time here has to offer.
