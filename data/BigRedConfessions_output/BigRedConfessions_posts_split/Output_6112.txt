"I know that when people look at me, they go ""Hey, this kid has his shit together. He's on the fast track for success.""

On the surface, that's true. To commonly accepted standards, I'm doing great: GPA, research, extracurriculars, etc. - he's locked down a solid summer job that pays well.

To tell the truth, I have no idea what the fuck I'm doing. I'm running faster than most, but I'm just as clueless about the direction I'm running in. I'm too weak to find the right way, and too cowardly to change tack even if I did. I don't really want or care too much about my accomplishments now, and it would be so easy to give up my pride (probably even arrogance) if I could just be happy."
