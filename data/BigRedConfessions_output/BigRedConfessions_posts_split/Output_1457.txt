I feel like a worm; like I am a parasite. Sometimes I feel that I try to suck as many resources as possible out of everything I do including my education at Cornell. I must be the most expensive student. Whenever I go eat I grab like a hundred napkins, because that's what I paid for. I also grab as many condiments as I can.
