I can't stand my apartment mates, they are self-centered and have not idea what being a friend entails. I'm tired of always being there for them but having do deal with my problems alone because they have "too much homework" or can't be bothered to listen to me for 10 minutes. I don't want to live with them anymore, but sadly we already renewed our lease
