"To all the people complaining about those of us receiving quite a bit of aid to come here:

I don't just have money to blow. Try being from another extreme of the country, only being able to go home once, or if I'm really lucky, twice a year, and having to shell out thousands of dollars for plane tickets-money that I wouldn't have unless I slaved my ass off working max hours while also maintaining an A average GPA at an Ivy League institution during the school year. 
Try not being able to pay that ""minimal"" $3,000 student contribution unless you again slave your ass off staying here during the summer to work because you don't have a job to go home to, because it's not your fault that you grew up in a community that's in need of jobs-where they are all taken. 

I didn't vacation on some luxurious beach during Spring Break. I stayed here and sucked it all up. 

Am I happy? Hell yeah I'm happy! 
I'm grateful to be so fortunate to attend a school like this and be able to reflect on all I've been through, it's beautiful.
At the end of the day, it's not worth it to be mad about working, working, and working most of the time.
I've learned to embrace what my life is and have taken pride in maintaining a positive and respectful attitude toward others and what life presents me with. 
In a life like this there is no time for petty BS and criticism, only room for optimism and a will to see those you surround yourself with be happy and chase their dreams, while you chase yours.
