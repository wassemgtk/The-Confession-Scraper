Some of the CS majors at this school are the most annoying and self-centered people I've ever met. Just because what you are studying is in high demand does not mean you are the smartest person on campus, and it certainly does not mean you get to look down on everyone else who is not studying CS. They are studying something else because it's not within their interests, not because they're "not smart enough." Get over yourselves.
