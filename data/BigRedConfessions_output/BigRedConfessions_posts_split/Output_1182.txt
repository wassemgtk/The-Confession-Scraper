I'm an undergrad girl who thinks that they're developing feelings for one of their roommates (of the opposite sex). I can't tell if they're throwing any signals my way or not. 

We're getting along so well right now, and I don't want to make things awkward in the house.. I've heard too many nightmarish stories of those kind of scenarios being played out and things going awry.

 But my heart aches when I think about them not being here. We've become good friends really quickly. 

To confound things even more, they're not going to be here next semester! They're going abroad, and then in the fall I won't be here b/c I'm going abroad. 

What's a girl supposed to do?...
