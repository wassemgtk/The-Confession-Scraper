To the almost man,
We texted for an entire summer, and fall for each other as much as you possibly can that way. You told me that I'm special, that I'm the first one you'd want to be with for a long time, that I'm impossible to believe. I understood that a fair amount of that is exaggeration, and in the fall when we stopped talking and we both met new people, I was really ok about it. More months go by. In a moment of weakness, I hooked up with you after you messaged me out of the blue, and I just wanted it to be that - a hook up. Months go by and then you want to see me again? Everything about you and all of your friends tell me that you tell romantic lies to every girl you want to hook up with, so why do you keep coming back after so many months each time? Why do I matter so much to you? Did you run out of girls? Did I actually mean something to you?
Very curious,
Your almost woman
