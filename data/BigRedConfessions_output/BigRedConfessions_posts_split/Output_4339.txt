"To the girl I was rude to this morning, I'm sorry.

You were texting while crossing the road near CTB and I was riding my bike. I was angry at you for getting in my way and that came out in my tone when I said ""look up"".

I really should have been more concerned for your safety (because texting while crossing the street not in a crosswalk is a bad idea) and had a tone that reflected that."
