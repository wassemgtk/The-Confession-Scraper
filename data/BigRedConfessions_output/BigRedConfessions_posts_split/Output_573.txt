As an alumnus I miss Pulled Pork and Turkey sandwiches from Short Stop Deli. I remember walking downhill all the way from school just to get one late at night. I wish I can be back in Ithaca right now because I am nostalgic for a toasted Turkey sandwich filled with capacity with bacon, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, provolone, oil and vinegar. YUMMMM!
