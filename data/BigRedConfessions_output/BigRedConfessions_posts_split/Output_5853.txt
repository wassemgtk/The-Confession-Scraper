To the blond girl I always see when I go up the slope and always smiles to me: thank you, you always lift my mood and make my day better, so the best I can do is smile back at you. If I see you today, I will talk to you and introduce myself, and if you don't mind, can we be friends? You seem to be a nice person and pretty cool.
