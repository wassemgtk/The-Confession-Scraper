For me the recycling bin is just another trash can located conveniently next to an already existing trash can. It's kinda like how in the SpongeBob movie Mr. Krabs builds another Krusty Krab next to the already existing one. I could care less in which trash bin I put my garbage in. One is just prettier (the blue one) than the other.
