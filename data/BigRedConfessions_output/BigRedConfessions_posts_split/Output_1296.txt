“men act like they’re in high school” or “don’t have it together” are not sour grapes or losers’ laments; they reflect a true and growing reality."

So, when it's women that are falling behind men by almost every measure there is, it's because society and the system and patriarchy are to blame and whatever. But when it's men that are falling behind, it's simply because men are low quality?

Seriously, it really bothers me to see so much hypocrisy in the world. What a bunch of BS.
