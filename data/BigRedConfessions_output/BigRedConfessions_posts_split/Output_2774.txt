It's hard to imagine that exactly one year ago, I was on the brink of committing suicide. There would be periods when I'd lock myself in the room and just drink my sorrows away for the entire week. I felt dumb. I felt unloved. I felt alone. I even remember sending out "goodbye" messages to my friends before making a move, apologizing for being such a pathetic excuse. 

Now, I can probably say I'm one happy camper and have never been so grateful. Sure, I still have my times when I feel down here and there but in the end, I can look back and say my experience here was worth it. Even though this is an anonymous post, I wanted to give a shoutout to all my friends who supported and trusted me all the way, even when I didn't in myself. I couldn't have done it without you all, and I'll be very sad to part ways when we graduate :( I guess this is a 2 in 1 confession... a. my suicidal contemplation last year and b. my fear of being separated from the ones I love.
