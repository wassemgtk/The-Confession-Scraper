I am a virgin. I really want to have sex and I feel like I am ready, but I don't have much experience with guys. I am too embarrassed to admit I am a 20 year old virgin. I really just want to get it over with with someone I am comfortable with. I'm not expecting to fall in love or anything. Isn't it supposed to be easy for a girl to get a guy who will have sex with her or am I just that undesirable...
