"To the most beautiful Indian girl on this campus. 
I see you walking up the slope everyday and you seem so relaxed and friendly. For some reason I can't muster the courage to speak to you. You have beautiful almond shaped eyes and the sickest hair I've ever seen. You wear no makeup and just look stunning. You always dress so well and look so classy. I heard you speaking to your friend once and youre so funny and chill. How do I even begin to approach to you? "
