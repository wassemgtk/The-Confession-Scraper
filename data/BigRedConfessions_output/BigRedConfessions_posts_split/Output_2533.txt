let this sink in
Chance and Magic combined, have 1/6 of the likes of kendrick Llamar, and 1/18 of ludacris (just on facebook).

So we went from great well known artists to who-the-hell-are-these-guys-who-only-have-2~3-good-songs.

and also, seriously hiphop for slope day AGAIN? i dont mind it bu at least either bring someone good or change to something else.
