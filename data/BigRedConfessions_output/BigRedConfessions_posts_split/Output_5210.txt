I saw a girl today begging for money in downtown Ithaca. She had a sign that said "Lost everything in a house fire. Every bit helps". She didn't seem like a homeless person at all. She was well-dressed, clean, she looked quite presentable in fact. And she was weeping.... I could tell she was weeping not so much because she'd lost everything but because she now had to humiliate herself in this way. She looked quite intelligent, so the look on her face was sort of - I can't believe this, I don't belong here, this isn't who I am, but I don't have a choice. I could have misread that, but she seemed so incredibly sincere, this may have been the first time I saw a sign like this and believed every word. It was morning and it was cloudy and cold, it'd just rained. She'd curled up in a corner in this really nice jacket, almost trying to hide how dejected she was. I'm from NYC, so I didn't pay much attention at first, just walked by quickly, read the sign and didnt stop, but then as then as I was walking away all of the aforementioned realizations kicked in. I thought on my way back I would give her $10, wish her best of luck and tell her that you never know what tomorrow will bring. By the time I made my way back it'd started raining again and she was gone.... That made me sad. I hope things work out for her. She may have thought as she was sitting there that no one cared about her or her circumstance, but I did see you. I wish I could buy you a cup of coffee, discuss the situation and see if I could help in any way other than with a petty sum of money.
