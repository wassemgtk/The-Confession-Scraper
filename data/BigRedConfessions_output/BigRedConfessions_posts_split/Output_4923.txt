Sometimes we make mistakes that are irreversible. We have the right to cry and be upset. But most of all, we have the right to forgive ourselves. 

The world won't stop as it seems it should. The people you hurt will remain wounded until you help heal them. And the money you lost will eventually be replaced if you can pull yourself together and keep your head up high. 

We humans make mistakes. At that moment, it is difficult to comprehend what else to do but hate yourself.

 But no matter how horrible it seems, we should see that there are two choices: we can be self-destructive and hateful ... Or we can learn to forgive ourselves and make something beautiful out of life.

Nothing is ever the end unless you yourself decide it to be.
