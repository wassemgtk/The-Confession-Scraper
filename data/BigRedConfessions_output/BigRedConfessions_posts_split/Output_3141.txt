Recently, I've noticed my erratic behavior. I seem to be annoyed by people in general. I've spent so much time alone(especially at Cornell) that I've gotten accustomed to being in my own world. I go out of my way to avoid people and especially people I know. I avoid going to the dining halls when there are a lot of people because I'm afraid someone will recognize me and would want to eat together. I never go to events I'm invited to by my friends. And I absolutely HATE group projects. Unfortunately, I'm in engineering and group work is such a large part of my classes. Senior year in my curriculum requires two courses(lab course & design course) that require a lot of group work and I don't know how I'm going to survive. (Btw, I'll be a senior next semester so this is me freaking out). I hate the presence of my roommate. Last semester, my roommate wasn't here so I lucked out and had a large single. This semester, however, I have a random roommate who just annoys me with his presence. He's a nice guy but the fact that he is always there (in my room) bothers me. I know this is not an appropriate way to behave but I can't help it that people piss me off. I guess Cornell conditioned me into a lone wolf. I wonder how I'll survive in the working world. (Any tips?) I just want to graduate already, get a job, and live with a cat. Why can't I fast forward to that part?
