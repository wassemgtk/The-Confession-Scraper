I don't know why I'm here.  I have no motivation to do anything and I feel like I'm just wasting my parents' money.  I haven't been to class in a month and I barely mustered the willpower to take my finals.  I always think maybe things will change and I'll get my shit together but in the back of my mind I know either way I won't really care.
