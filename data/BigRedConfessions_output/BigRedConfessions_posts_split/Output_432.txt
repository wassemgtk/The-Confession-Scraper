Sometimes when I'm walking on campus, I would stop in the middle of the road and ask myself questions like how can a place be this beautiful and how lucky I am to get a chance to spend four years here.

Even with all the stress, peer pressure, self-loathing and social anxiety, 3 prelims plus 3 papers in the same week, I never for once regret coming to Cornell.
