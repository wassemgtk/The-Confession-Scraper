I don't get it.  Every weekend I go to parties with my friends and while they're off having fun and hooking up with guys, i'm just standing there and thinking to myself "i would not want to hook up with a single one of these guys." I don't get the hookup culture.  Maybe it's just me, but I feel gross after I hook up with someone I don't know, and I don't understand people who begin relationships with hook ups and then start dating that person.  Maybe i'm old fashioned, but I do want to hook up with someone who I don't have feelings for, and I don't have feelings for someone just because they're attractive. I really want to find someone who can make me laugh, and who can be there for me when I cry.  But I don't want to find him by getting trashed and hooking up at a party. Isn't there more to life than that?
