No, really, I just simply *adore* the fact that you only want to be friends and hang out/keep in contact at all when you're having a rough time, with that psycho girlfriend or otherwise. It's -exactly- what everyone wants out of a friendship, to be used for emotional support, and then to be ignored when not needed. Yeah, right. If you're going to be a friend, live up to it. If not, I'm not listening to your shit anymore. Your choice.
