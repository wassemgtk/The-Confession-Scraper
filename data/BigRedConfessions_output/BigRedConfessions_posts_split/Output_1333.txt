Does it qualify as rape if I was too drunk to remember whether I consented or not, let alone remember any details of what happened except for knowing that I had sex with a very close friend? Does it qualify as rape if he was also very drunk, but not as drunk as I was (in the sense he remembers everything that happened)? Am I a bad person to still be friends with him and not hate him at all? In fact, my feelings for him have not changed at all. He was a good friend and is a good friend. I am just so confused right now!
