I've been struggling with severe PCOS for about 2 years now and it's affected my life SO much. I look like a totally different person due to the weight gain and I basically give up on trying to fix this because nothing has worked so far. I hope to find other people who also have this problem and we would help motivate me/we can get each other through this!!
