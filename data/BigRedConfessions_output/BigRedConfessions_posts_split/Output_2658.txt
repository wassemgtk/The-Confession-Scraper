I came into engineering as a guy who followed the rules. I was naive enough to believe that hard work will help you succeed. This place changed my belief because here hard work does not necessarily translate into success. Freshman year, my GPA was low. My friends had higher ones and I thought to myself. What am I doing wrong? I put in more work than them. I don't copy homework or cheat on tests. Then, through talking with upperclassmen and older friends, I began to put together the pieces. I started playing the system. I took easy business classes to boost my GPA. I started copying homework and cheating on tests. My GPA has only gone up since freshman year. People will tell you that GPA is just a number and blah, blah, blah. THIS IS NOT TRUE. If you want a good job, you need a high one or companies won't even give you a second look. That is the harsh reality. I started playing the odds and taking chances because I have nothing to lose and everything to gain. And we all know it's only after we've lost everything, that we're free to do anything.
