I am an international student while my housemates live about an hour away from campus. One of them goes home every weekend while the others go home at least once a month. Whenever they need me, I'm there. But when I need someone to be there for me, they always choose going home over me. I know that family is important, but they are the only family I have here and I wish they would understand that. It pains me when they complain about missing home when I only get to see my family once a year. I just feel very lonely in this school, sometimes.
