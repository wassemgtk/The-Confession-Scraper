Do you ever read a confession and just immediately know it's about you? Well, that just happened. Post #3703. Please text me. I want to talk it out. I know you'd rather I just disappeared, but you can't let something like this affect your life for the rest of our time here at Cornell. I swear I'm not a troll trying to get you to text your ex, because I'm almost positive I am your ex. And if I'm not, then text him anyway. If it's me, I promise it'll be ok. If it's not me and he's still a dick to you, give him a good kick in the balls for me! :)
