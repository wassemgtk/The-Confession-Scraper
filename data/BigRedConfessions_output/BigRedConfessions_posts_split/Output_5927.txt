I'm strangely terrified for the end of the school year. Maybe because I know the next one will be so different, with responsibilities kicked up a notch or six, being out of my rather shitty living situation, and really not having a whole lot off friends, since some of my best friends are graduating. I'm hoping for the best, but that's not often what you find, is it?
