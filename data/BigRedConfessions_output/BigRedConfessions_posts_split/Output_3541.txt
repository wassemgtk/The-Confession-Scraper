A good friend of mine from high school wants to try to start up a relationship with me. The problem is, we go to different schools, so we'd be starting long distance and building on nothing. I'd never get to take her out to dinner, or hold her in my arms, or even just hang out with her. I don't have a lot of faith in long distance, especially if the relationship has never been or may never be anything else.

I really like her, though. And I also value our friendship quite a bit. I know this isn't really a confession, but what should I do to avoid hurting her?
