I'm a senior with a 2.1 GPA. I'm also on academic warning, which means that if I get a C- or below, I'm permanently dismissed from Cornell. I'm pretty sure I'm close to a C in two of my classes. I live with unbearable anxiety every single day. If I fuck up and don't get my degree, all the time I've spent here ( and all of my parents money) will be for nothing. And even if I do graduate, who is going to take someone with a 2.1 GPA seriously? I'm scared. I never understood why people commit suicide, but after coming to Cornell I've started to understand why. I'm an atheist, but sometimes I pray to God so that it will all go away.
