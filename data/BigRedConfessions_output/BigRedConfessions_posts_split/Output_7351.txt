"I don't even know why I'm writing this note. I'm sorry if it hurts you. I've never been very good at explaining myself to you. I always tried and did very badly. It's nice to tell myself that I was scared of explaining myself to you because I thought I might disgust you.

Objectively, our relationship probably wasn't very good. We were in a codependent bubble where we told each other we didn't need anybody else. And I was really really happy. But I knew that it wasn't quite perfect deep down. I knew that one person couldn't be all of somebody's existance. Even though I was happy with you as all of mine.

Life's hard. This note sucks and doesn't say anything. I really just want to read my thoughts off the page, not write them down.

I don't want to date, I don't want to fuck, I don't want to be in love. I do want to lie next to you and remember that we both were content hanging out for the rest of eternity. It's honestly the only thing I've ever wanted from anybody. A friend who gets how I think and doesn't mind laying next to me. And I can't find her.

I'm happy single. I've been going to a lot more parties and seeing a lot more of my friends. That's nice. Still haven't hooked up with anybody at a party - doesn't even matter to me - I probably coulda closed last night - but its nice to think about taking her home and to flirt without your look.

You see her when you close your eyes / Maybe one day you'll understand why / Everything you touch surely dies.

I don't know if I should be trying to understand why I see you when I close my eyes or why everything I touch surely dies. 

Well you see her when you fall asleep / but never to touch and never to keep / 'cause you loved her too much / and you dived too deep

I'm sorry that I wasn't good to you. I did try. I wanted your love and I wasn't ready to give my own."
