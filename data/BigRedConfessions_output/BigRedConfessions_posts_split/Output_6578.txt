So I get hooking up is fun and people do it all the time in college. I've done it before and don't regret it, and I don't hold anything against people who do hook up regularly. However, I absolutely hate it when guys who have a lengthy sexual history justify their behavior by using an evolutionary argument, like by comparing themselves to animals who aim to copulate with multiple mates to produce the best offspring. I've seen this happen multiple times recently and I can't believe people are actually considering it legitimately. You just equated yourself to an uncivilized animal. And I can only hope that doesn't mean you don't treat your sexual partners with the respect that humans are capable of and should be demonstrating. If that's how you choose to view yourself then to each his own, but I like to think that as humans we're more advanced than wild creatures who go around banging each other freely. Yes sex is natural, yes it's enjoyable, and there are definitely parallels between animal and human relations. But you can't compare animal sex to human sex. We're not uncivilized animals who use it primarily as a means of survival. If you like casual sex, then just own up to it (nothing wrong with being sexually liberated!) instead of feeling the need to justify it with some bs argument, which, btw, you're using within the context of an institution of higher education. Just my two cents.
