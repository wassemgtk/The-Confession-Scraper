Whenever I run into those few REALLY hot guys on campus I can't breath. They come out of nowhere and I never see them coming! I'll go around a corner, look up and BAM! Hello gorgeous. I feel like my face looks scared when this happens and so i just sort of hurry away to the library. God bless you big red boys!
