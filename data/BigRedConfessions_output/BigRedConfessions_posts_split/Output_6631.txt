I know I am generalizing a bit but more often then not, these observations hold true. The undergrad girls at Cornell are different and that's not a good thing. I've been fortunate enough to meet, date and become friends with girls from many schools (including ones as diverse as Yale, Chicago, Oregon, etc and etc). Compared to them, the girls here tend to be more stuck-up, snobbish, and materialistic. I don't know what it is about Cornell but so many people have a chip on their shoulder. Wait until you get into the real world.
