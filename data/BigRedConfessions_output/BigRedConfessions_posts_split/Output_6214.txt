I feel alone majority of the time. I hang out with friends sometimes at dinner, but immediately after I feel lonely and as if they only are with me because they feel bad for me. I need constant confirmation that they like me (not that I ask for it) but without it I revert to the cautious quiet state, when back home I was an extrovert. I don't know what changed or how to fix it, all I know is that it is causing me anxiety.
