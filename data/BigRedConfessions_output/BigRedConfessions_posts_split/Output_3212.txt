I was kicked out of Cornell for being accused of committing a horrible crime; sexual assault. The only issue is, I didn't do it. Ithaca Police say I didn't do it. Other people say I didn't do it. I say I didn't do it. But yet, Cornell somehow finds me guilty. Cornell is not a legal body, so why are they investigating these crimes when a real legal body already did? Too often students have their rights infringed on because of false biases and misinformed investigations without any credible evidence. So, when Cornell's name is slandered on national media outlets, just know it's for a valid reason. I'm coming for you, Cornell.
