You should not touch other people's things, even if they are stored in a communal kitchen.  If you don't have the common decency to not touch what isn't yours, at the very least, clean what you use.  Some asshole decided to use my pan to make some meat product and did not clean it.  My disdain for whoever this was comes from the very bottom of my vegetarian heart.
