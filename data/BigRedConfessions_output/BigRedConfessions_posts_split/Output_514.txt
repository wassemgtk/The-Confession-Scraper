"TO #7579

Firstly, I hope you are well and pray that God guides you to truth, I’m going to share my perspective with you on this topic, and I hope you consider this with an open and sincere heart.  So, I’m a Muslim, but wait, don’t let that turn you away.  Please read this through.  God is one, and I’m sure as a Christian you agree.  The belief in the Trinity is a major point of disagreement between Islam and Christianity.  But I just want you to ponder on the idea that every prophet before Jesus the Messiah [peace be upon him] (Adam, Moses, Abraham, Noah, and so on, peace be upon them all) preached that salvation is achieved by worshiping the one, true God as He has taught us through his messengers. It has always been one, simple message, and before Jesus [PBUH], that was enough to earn you heaven.  Sadly, though Jesus’s [PBUH] true message was exactly that, and there are still remnants of it in the Bible (e.g. “”the Father is greater than I” (John 14:28), “The Lord our God is one Lord” (Mark 12:29), “I can do nothing on my own. I judge as God tells me. Therefore, my judgment is just, because I carry out the will of the one who sent me, not my own will” (John 5:30)), the Church (no disrespect) has distorted the message and it has come to the point where God has become three parts.  God is not a God of confusion.  He wants us to have a clear path to worship Him and He will reward us; life isn’t meant to be a trick question because God is more merciful than that.  The Bible calls MANY “God’s sons”, but common sense leads you to understand that it means these are righteous slaves of God, not his literal sons. Somehow, with Jesus(PBUH), people have come to take this literally.  I know this is a lot to take in, but I want to ask you to PLEASE watch the video below of the audio recording of Surah Maryam (the chapter of Mary, Jesus’s (PBUH) mother) in the Quran. The Quran only has one, unchanged version because God promised to preserve it until the end of days, when Jesus (PBUH) will return to defeat the anti-Christ. I hope this will be a starting point for you to learn about Islam, which means “submission” (to God).  I hope you don’t take this offensively or think I am trying to denounce your beliefs.  In the end, God is one, and if you pray for Him to guide you to the straight path with a sincere heart, He will not leave you hanging. “And whoever believes in God - He will guide his heart. And God is Knowing of all things” (Quran 64:11).  I have no vested interest in trying to mislead you. Do what makes sense to you and keep faith in God.

PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE LISTEN TO THIS CHAPTER IN THE QURAN (w/ English subs). I think it will answer some of your questions.
