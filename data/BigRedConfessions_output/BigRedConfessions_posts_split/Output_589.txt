"I wish the Ivy Room had a Wurlitzer Jukebox like the one my parents remember and told me about. Those must have been the days. Then I would hang out by the Jukebox with my beautiful girlfriend and would drop in a quarter to play ""My True Story"" by The Jive Five or ""Maybe"" by The Chantels.

""This story ends yeah
It was no lie
Names have been changed dear
To protect you and I
But we must cry, cry
Cry whoa-uh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Our blues away
(Cry cry cry)
Mmm (whoa-uh our blues away)
We must cry
(Cry cry cry whoa-uh our blues away)"""
