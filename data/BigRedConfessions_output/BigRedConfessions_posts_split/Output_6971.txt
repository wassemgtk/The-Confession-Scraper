I love how he tried to preface it: "I was drunk, guys!! And I was high!! And I was on uppers!!" Fuck this piece of shit. Fuck his feeble excuses, and fuck his defenses for keeping silent to you. Fuck him. YOU should have gotten to choose if you wanted to stay with the guy who cheated on you. People like that only make excuses because they're too pathetic to take responsibility for their own actions. And it will always be a never-ending cycle with these assholes because they never man up and actually get the stones to apologize.
