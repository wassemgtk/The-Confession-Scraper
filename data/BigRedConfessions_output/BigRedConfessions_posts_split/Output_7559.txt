If you don't believe long distance can work, why would you pursue me? Why would you refer to me as your girlfriend -- but want to be nonexclusive? Is it crazy to think that if two people want to make something work, they can? it won't be perfect or easy and I'm 120% aware of that, but I think I'm worth more than the half assed crap I'm getting now. It just sucks because I ended up falling in love with you, too. I just wish that you would try. Or that I would find someone here who makes me feel the way you make me feel.
