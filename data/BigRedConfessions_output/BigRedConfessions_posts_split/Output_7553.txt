I wish I knew how everyone just has all their stuff together. They have their research and extra cirics, they take their classes and get decent grades, they have time to have fun, they get internships, they have time to sleep more than 6 hours every night, and they all are able to be happy - genuinely happy. I have none of these and only seem to be getting worse.
