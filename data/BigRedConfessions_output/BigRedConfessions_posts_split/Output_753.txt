I should have never come to Cornell because I have no ability to network, no hobbies or talents, and these days I'm not even studying properly. I just hole up in my room and procrastinate the night away, cram for prelims, and have no friends. The joke's on me: I have bad grades, no social life, and let's be honest, the Ivy League brand isn't what it used to be, so I can't even open any doors with it.
