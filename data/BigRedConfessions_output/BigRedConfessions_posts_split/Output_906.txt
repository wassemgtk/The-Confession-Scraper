I wish guys had more courage to express their true feelings. You could show all of the signs momentarily, but even as girls we doubt you. We don't want to be that girl you just want to "hook up" with. We want to make sure you respect us and that your feelings are true. The best way to do that is to continue talking to the girl (even more than a year later), even if she initially rejects you. Then we know and have no doubt.
