I've always found the posts about finding love to be a little too cheesy for me. I didn't realize that I'd eventually be posting my own confession, but here goes. I haven't felt like this in a long time. Every second I spend apart from you is incredibly painful, and I can't concentrate on anything else. When I'm around our friends, I'm scared to let my true feelings show. I really wish I knew how you felt, so that I can do something about this heartache.
