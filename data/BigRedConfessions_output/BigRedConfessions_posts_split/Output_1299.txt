Alright, here's the thing, people. Bernie Sanders is not actually a socialist. Socialism is defined as a socioeconomic system in which the means of production are socially owned. Thus, a socialist advocates for the transformation of the preexisting economy into one in which the workers collectively and democratically manage their own workplaces, instead of one dominated by privately-owned businesses.

What Sanders identifies as, a reformist democratic socialist, refers to someone who seeks to achieve that goal through reforms within the existing political system. But he only seeks to through reform make capitalism more regulated, not with any ultimate goal of abolishing capitalism itself.

Thus, Bernie Sanders is not actually a democratic socialist, but a social democrat. The Scandinavian countries he talks about are also social democratic, not socialist. Social democracy is a capitalist ideology that advocates for a more regulated economy and government intervention in social welfare, and it is not socialism.
