This semester was extremely challenging and rough. I was having really bad emotional breakdowns and getting lots of pressure from my academic performances. I was so stressed that I almost dropped out of all the organizations I belonged and from the friends circle. Although it was hard, this really made me realize who really cared about me and who didn't. I just wanted to thank those of you who really cared and supposed me through this semester <3
