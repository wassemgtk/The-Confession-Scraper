I got a really great internship for this summer in New York City, and I am really excited because it's a great company, and I've wanted to live in NYC for as long as I can remember. But I am very nervous that I am not ready for the position (on my paper resume, my qualifications look great, but I think I tend to disappoint), and I also probably won't have friends in the summer - there's fewer than ten interns. I really do hope I can succeed, and also find some friends with whom I can enjoy the entire city as I've always imagined.
