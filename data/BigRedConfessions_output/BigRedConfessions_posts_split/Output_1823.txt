Im not actually a student, but an employee and over the summer I worked with the coolest guy. I only worked a few shifts with him but it was always so fun and we had such fun conversations! I know he's a student but I don't think he's working there anymore. He's so fun and I wish I'd gotten to know him better. I definitely think I could like him a lot and it seems reciprocated. I don't even have his number but I'm hoping some sort of chance or fate will bring us together. Cross your fingers for me!
