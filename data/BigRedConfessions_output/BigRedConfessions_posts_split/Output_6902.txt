"I'm still here today
Happier and healthier 
Thanks to the professor who cared
Who noticed I wasn't well
Who asked what she could do for me.
Thanks to the grad students who restored my faith in people
With their patience and friendliness.
Thanks to the friend 
Who saw in me
Someone interesting and lovable
When I felt insignificant and dull
Thanks to these people 
For bringing joy into my life "
