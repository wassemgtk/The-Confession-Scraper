First, I'm sorry. I know I said it about a thousand times to you, but it's how I feel. It was terrible of me to do something like that, but I had to do it. To protect you. I'm not mentally stable enough to keep going like we were. I'm afraid I'm not going to make it, and I don't want to hurt you. It tore me up inside watching your face through that terrible excuse, but I had to do it. You don't deserve that. You deserve better than some piece of shit that doesn't even know whether or not they want to continue living. So keep on hating me. I've been doing it for years.
