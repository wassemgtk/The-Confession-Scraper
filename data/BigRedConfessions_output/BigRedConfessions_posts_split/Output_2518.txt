I love cows so much. I love dairy products and Cornell ice cream and milk so much, and I just want to make cow noises walking through campus but I am embarassed to show my love of cows for fear that people or my friends might think I'm weird :/. Especially because I went to school here because I wanted to be around cows. Anyways MOOOOOOOOOOOOO! That is all. 😎❤️🐄🐄🐄🐄🐄🐄🐄🐄🐄🐄🐄🐄🐄🐄🐄🐮🐮🐮🐮🐮🐮🐮🐮🐮🐮🐮🐮🐮❤️🐻🐻🐻🐻🍦
