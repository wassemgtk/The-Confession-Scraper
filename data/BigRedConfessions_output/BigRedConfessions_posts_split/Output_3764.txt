"I wish I said no.

I wish I said no when my friend left us alone together, come back. I wish I said no when he offered to walk home with me, I'm pretty drunk but I can manage by myself. I wish I said no when he entered my dorm building and got on the elevator with me, I'm tired and I want to go to bed. I wish I said no when he came into my room without me inviting him in, I don't feel comfortable. I wish I said no when he leaned in to kiss me, I'm not interested. I wish I said no when it hurt, put your clothes back on and get the hell out of here. I wish I said no instead of spending the most uncomfortable four hours of my life in a bed with him, go away.

I said yes because I didn't know how to tell him no. For years I always thought that if I was ever in a situation like this I'd know how to do it and I didn't. I didn't.

Ladies and gentlemen, please say no when you want to say no. Say it loud, say it clearly, say it until they get it. Don't be silent."
