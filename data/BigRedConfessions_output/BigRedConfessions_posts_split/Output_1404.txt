One of the questions that "reporter" asked in the Fox News segment was about whether students would want to host Guatemalans on their floors. And I couldn't help but think: am I the only one who would happily say yes? I would gladly host a couple of Guatemalan refugees on the floor of my fraternity house bedroom if it were possible. They deserve relief from the awful conditions our country has had such a hand in creating. Besides, these are probably people with fascinating stories and insights into a different culture. I'd rather have mutual understanding with these people than shut the door on them because they're of a different nationality and ethnicity.

I don't know when we became so scared of our neighbors and fellow humans, but it's really kinda sad.
