"I was initially paralyzed by the words spilling out of your mouth. That certain piercing despair was followed by painful anxiety. It's been so very difficult learning to look past all the signs of attachment. I've been trying to do so gracefully because I am not one to hold grudges. Maybe I was so delusional and so in love with the theory of us being together? Maybe I fell too soon and too fast? Maybe I lacked the courage to ask what was happening earlier on because deep down I knew it wasn't true at all yet I'd have given anything to stop it from ending? Maybe I knew what I was bound to hear, I just negated it (for my own sake) so my own intense self agony could manifest itself in this idea of perfection and harmony. I did this to myself and that is why I was so angry initially.

It's such a relief to know now what's going on. The entire experience has had me realize how I can't control others' desires. I will never be able to force a certain feeling out of you, or out of anyone. I thought I had learned this from my past relationship yet there was still this certain fear of not being noticed at all by anyone. It still grows inside of me every second that I live, begging for any sort of monumental projection of the shadows and lights of this world. I was so sure that I was the only one who was entirely persuaded that I am nothing in this universe, that mine is the only existence. I wanted so badly to learn of the multi polarities of your black melancholy, with the complete knowledge that even I too, am not at all emotionally capable of a relationship. Because I live in my own state of melancholy. Though there is no romance, I can never look at you with disgust or hate. I would never want to seek revenge. I would never question you or belittle you. I see your worth and I look past your flaws and self belittlement completely, whether this entire thing was romantic or not, whether you're hiding yourself away or not. I no longer have any anger towards myself. I had to let it bleed out of my skin. Then I became in touch with reality: I still matter. I have to take care of myself first. Although life for me is torture, I cannot renounce my sincerity towards those who help me see my own worth in any way.

I do not know why I live or why I do not stop living. These are the questions I encounter daily. I see such absurd motives for living and I'd say that I reject the world. I wish I could say that I am unafraid to glide alone in this absolute nothingness that this world provides. That would be a lie. 

I just want to avoid regret as much as possible because that is what paralyzes and cuts short of our aspirations. This was all a graceful dream, absent of the usual tragic and intense sadness that shadow my inner flow. So I do not regret it at all. This was about a captivity, an ecstasy away from this brutal world that mingled and sparked, only in my own mind, a weird dance. This certain mysterious obscurity still exists and I still want it to exist with all of my heart. Hell, I can't even look at you without feeling that dance. It will no longer hurt for me because I can no longer distinguish between hope and despair. I find ways to trigger both, I will never be self enlightened.

None of this will ever make sense. The thought of what has happened will fuck with my mind for a while. But then I think back and realize that none of this is significant at all. "
