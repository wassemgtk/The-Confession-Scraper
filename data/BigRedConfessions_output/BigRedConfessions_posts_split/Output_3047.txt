My parents have always appeared to be very 'liberal' about what I do. But in fact i can feel their expectations. When I talked to them about what really fascinates me -music, art, literature, philosophy, they would dismissively say that you can't count on those things don't make a living. I'm getting a degree in Econ, as they wanted, but all I really want to is to be a writer, to travel around the world, to get the most of this life. And all the comparison to the others Sometimes I wonder if they just don't want to lose the reputation as the well-doing ones in the family. Maybe I'm just a dumb romantic but I think life ought to have more than material pleasure.
