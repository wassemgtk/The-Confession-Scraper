Let's just say I've become highly disillusioned with people of my culture at Cornell lately. While some if not most of them are really genuine people, others really have tried to disturb my peace this past year. I came to Cornell with the idea of fitting in to this identity and helping serve "my people" but at the rate that some of "my own people" have tried to bulldoze my self esteem, I am beginning to question the value that sticking up for "my people" has to me. (Because it includes some of the most evil spirited people I've ever met.)
A big part of me wants to just say "fuck you" and move out of the community.
Another part of me sees the faces of some of my best friends and supporters pleading for me to stay.

I think I need a semester abroad....
