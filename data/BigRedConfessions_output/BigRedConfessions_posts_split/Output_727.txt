All these posts about ""Nobody here knows me"" make me feel bad. Is society at the point where people are presumptuous enough to think that in 4 years they can get to know someone perfectly? The human mind has such depth and complexity that I wouldn't even dare claim to know some of my better friends here. Life is a struggle and it sculpts us bit by bit: we are born granite and experience chips away at us until some semblance of a person is made. 
     I have learned in my time here to not follow the crowd, to not base my assumptions on externalities or single instances of actions, to not judge someone based on their political beliefs (we are still children), to think before I act, and to see money for what it really is: a piece of paper. Yes money is our livelihood and I don't believe in the ""do whatever you want in college"" bullshit (unless you have the financial means) but money is secondary in our search for meaning.
