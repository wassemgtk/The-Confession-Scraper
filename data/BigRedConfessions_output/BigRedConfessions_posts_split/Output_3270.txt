I laugh nervously whenever I see cheating confessions on this page now haha. I haven't been *cheating* on my significant other but I've liked someone else for a while and I don't know how to break up with my current SO. To make matters worse I'm pretty sure my SO thinks I'm cheating with that person even though I'm not...

A lot of stress is building up around this problem, because 1. I know us breaking up is going to lead to a large amount of stress for both of us... right in the middle(?) of the semester and 2. I panic whenever I think about another person going out with the person I've been starting to like...
