"To those of you who are struggling out there, for whatever reason, hang on! 
I can't tell you that it's worth it, I can't tell you that everything will be okay either. 
But I want you to know that I have hit the absolute threshold and I'm fucking lonely and sad, I even lost my dreams and hope.
But so what? Just have to deal with it. 
You are not alone, when you are sad about not having fun, just remember you are not the only one. "
