I don't know why I feel bad sometimes. I just want to be a better me,,, I want to get A+ in my classes, and I have tried so hard...I want to have better relationships with others and I want to have more friends, also I want to have a boyfriend who really cares about me,,,, but it is so hard to meet that person,, I don't know what to do to make the situation better....
