I learned that I dove into a relationship before getting to TRULY know the person. But now that I'm in a committed relationship, I'm realizing we're not that compatible and she's kind of a salty person. But now it's moving way too fast and I'm not ready to settle down with her. I'd rather be friends, but I'm afraid that I'll hurt her feelings if I cancel all these future plans I made with her.
