There are so many dumb people are Cornell. I thought -- well, Cornell is not the very very best when it comes to the world's leading universities. It's certainly up there, but there are better ones. Then I went to Harvard -- same deal. Tons of dumb people. I met a few people from Yale and Princeton too. It's shocking how many of them talk like the cast of Jersey shore. A shocking number of them if I just randomly met and started talking to I'd assume they barely finished high school.These institutions have sub 10% acceptance rates. Harvard's is 5-6% I think. Who the heck are they turning down?
