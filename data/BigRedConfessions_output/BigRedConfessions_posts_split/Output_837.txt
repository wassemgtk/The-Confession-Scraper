I dislike the label "white". My family comes from a poorer "white" country. I have lived in the US my whole life, but did not grow up with cable TV, video games, or a cellphone. When I was in high school, my parents took us to visit their home country and some areas are unbelievably poor. The majority of Cornell students have no idea. It's one thing to see a picture or write a paper with internet research, and another to spend more than a day there.

My immigrant parents worked harder than I ever will. This country is run by immigrants because they will do whatever it takes. If they get knocked down, they get right back up, no questions asked.
