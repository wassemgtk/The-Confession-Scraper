I have no idea what you are looking for but honestly, I truly hope you find it. Because the way you are living your life and choosing your actions sounds so sad, lonely, and empty. It's a terrible way to choose to live your life and it will push people worth being around far far away. I have no idea if my words mean anything to you but, I do hope this makes you think about how your actions absolutely destroyed someone who actually cared about you, absolutely loved you, and tried their absolute hardest for over three years. That's all I really have to say. Bye
