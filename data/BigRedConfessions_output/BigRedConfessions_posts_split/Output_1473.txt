I currently hold multiple jobs because of financial reasons and trying to balance that with my studies is starting to drain my energy and I've noticed I get cranky really easily now. I want to cut back on the amount of time I spend working, but I don't know if being overly booked and stressed out is a legitimate reason and if my employers would even care. However at the same time I also need the money because my parents are working so hard to make ends meet and I don't want to be a financial burden to them when they're already invested so much in trying to get me into college. I sometimes wonder how my life would be different and probably easier if I were born into a nice middle class family like most people on campus. But that isn't my reality and it's hard for me to talk about this with my friends who are clearly much better off than I am financially. I realize that I have it better than some people around me and I probably don't have a right to complain compared to those who don't receive financial aid and still can't pay, but I just wanted to get that off my chest. Thanks for reading :)
