Over time, I've grown distant from people who I used to be close with.  It hurts to think about good times you had with people you barely talk to now.  Not sure if it's better to forget about them and appreciate the friendships I do have now, or try to reconnect with them in the hopes of attaining a semblance of the closeness we used to have.
