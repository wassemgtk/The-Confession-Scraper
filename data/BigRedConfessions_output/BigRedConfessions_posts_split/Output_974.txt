I had an eating disorder for 7 years now. I can't go a day without being scared of my disorder. I love food and but i hate myself from the first bite. I started this disorder because people used to make fun of me for being fat. I lost the weight but I am paying the price by being mediocre and weak at a time in my life where I should be working towards my goals. If only I could go back in time ,I would go slap myself in the past when I first started this behavior. I wish the people who called me fat never did. People make so many off handed comments without realizing the consequences. I know I should have been strong and shouldn't have let those comments get to me. But I am human. I was a teenager, lonely and badly wanted to make friends. I didn't want people to be disgusted by me. I think I am a fun,interesting and a creative person underneath all my layers of fat. I wish someone would appreciate me for who I am. I wish someone would treat me like a pretty girl too.
