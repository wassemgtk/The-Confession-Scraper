I finally admitted to myself that I'm seasonally depressed. And now that I've actually acknowledged it, I'm working on it. Saying that it's easy would be a lie. But it's so much better than where I was. I didn't know I was strong enough to get here. I know a lot of people are probably a lot worse off than I was in terms of depression, but, please, don't give up. It's worth it.
