I wish I had a friend who could embrace me and help me when I am feeling low at Cornell, since that has been a long term ordeal. I wish I had a friend that would cry with me when I feel like shit and could drink with me so that we could forget our misery and when we're happy we can go out and eat something for dinner together. I wish I could have a friend that provided me with the benefits of a significant other sans the sexual part, although I would want to cuddle and sleep with them in the same bed and they could tell me it will be alright. I wish that they could support me no matter what my political or cultural beliefs are too and we could just enjoy life. I wish that they could also stay on the right side of the law and do things that are kosher.
