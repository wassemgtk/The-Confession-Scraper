I'm done dealing with you. You've done nothing but drag me down and introduce a constant stream of negativity into my life. Your self-absorption, pessimism, hypocrisy, and unwillingness to change has gone too far. Sure we've had some good times, but it's for my own sanity that I think we should stop being friends. Why the hell does this feel like a breakup?
