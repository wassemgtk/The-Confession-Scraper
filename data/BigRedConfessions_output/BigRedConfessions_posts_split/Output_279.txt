I finally discovered what I wanted to do in life and what I want to make of myself. I have rediscovered Jesus in my post-Cornell journey and I know that he is watching me as I make it through life everyday. The beauty of his works is erupting again as the rebirth of Spring dawns upon us at this time. I hope that people can find Jesus in their life when they are at their darkest hours. May God bless everyone and may God Bless the United States of America! :)
