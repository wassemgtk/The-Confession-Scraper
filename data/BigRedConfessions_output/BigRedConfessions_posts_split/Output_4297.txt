"I am a pedophile.

This does not mean I've ever acted upon my urges. It merely refers to the emotional and physical attraction I experience toward prepubescents. I am attracted to them in precisely the same way most people reading this are attracted to others around their age. Knowing that I am this way depresses me a great deal because it is something I must always keep a secret; I fear that if I tried to confide this to a friend or family member, they would never speak to me again. I even know that many who read this will already be fuming because I understand completely how despicable you think this is. I can feel your hatred through the screen. I've even read stories of people like me (and there are many, believe me) going to see psychiatrists and getting turned away for no more reason than contempt. This is not even mentioning how little research has been done on the condition because c'mon, do you think pedophiles report themselves knowing the stigma attached?

I do not consider this a mental illness or some perverted fetish; this is my entire sexual orientation and I've known it since I was 18 (22 now). Whenever I am in the presence of an adorable little angel that I have a crush on, I am stricken with a pang of deep sadness. I want nothing more than to confess my feelings to them, to take them out to dinner, to play and laugh with them, to snuggle up and watch a movie with them. This will never happen of course because these desires make me, to the rest of the world, a filthy beast, the scum of the earth.

To the admin: I understand if you choose not to post this. In fact, I expect what I've typed above to be thrown into the void due to its nature. My only plea is that you consider this as a form of catharsis for me, since I feel I have absolutely no one to talk to. I just want more people to know that individuals like myself exist, we are surprisingly numerous, and we DETEST being grouped in with molesters, kidnappers, rapists, and murderers. We merely want awareness and understanding.
