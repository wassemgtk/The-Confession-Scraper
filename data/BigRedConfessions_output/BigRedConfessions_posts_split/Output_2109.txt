"I hate to say it but the vast majority of us will not have the futures we envisioned.

I would venture to say the only worthwhile majors are Nursing, Accounting, and Engineering. Those fields don't require post-grad education to live a decent life, but that is changing for the worse.

All other majors require more DEBT and more YEARS OF YOUR FINITE LIFE to have a crack at a decent living. Sure, for example, doctors may get paid a lot(for the time being), but that takes twelve years and an inordinate debt load that firmly secures you in a stressful medical career for life. But then there is the issue of insurance companies, lack of reimbursement, and poor working environments (i.e. little interaction with patients, inability to have lucrative private practice). Of all you pre-meds, how many are actually in contact with recently graduated med students? Have you ever thought to ask them what the REALITY is? It's utter SHIT and doctors are generally dissatisfied and some are leaving the profession. Sure, a Porsche is nice, but when you can't treat patients because insurance formalities and malpractice stress, material things become vapid. It's like being a poor person with a lot of money. But in spite of this, if you still want to be a doctor, good on you! That's exactly who we need as medical professionals. Everyone else is deluding themselves with the ""Kool-Aid"" ivy style.

And that brings to me my main point. When you came to Cornell, did you ever consider why you should come here? Did you really think that buying into the  ""Ivy League"" would make you demonstrably more ""well rounded"", ""wealthy"" or ""educated""? I would like to see the empirical evidence. Please, prove me wrong. The American Job Market is becoming automatized. Unless Mommy and Daddy have a lot of money and connections, your debt is most likely a life sentence. Actually, I take that back, employers can't be bothered when sifting through hundreds of inflated resumes, so an Ivy League pedigree may still be useful. But does Cornell really teach you demonstrable skills that you couldn't learn elsewhere on the cheap? More likely... Cornell teaches you to meet the pre-determined conclusions made by professors and coerces you to agree with those conclusions with grades. But that's every college... soo.....

College, especially nowadays, is a SCAM that you are willingly buying into. Education is not a bad thing! But Education does not always mean School. Bless President Skorton, he is a good man that gets too much unwarranted flack (god, do some of you even understand your own arguments or know a thing or two about respect?) . But damn, check out his salary and compare that with your projected starting salaries. Even with an Engineering PhD or an MD you'll be spending years just trying to break even.

The only solution to this dilemma? People should stop attending college and let many of them go out of business. Demand that college level education should be technical and linked to the job market and be very specific (1-2 year programs) Well roundedness is akin to communism... aka shit. There are flaws with this plan (and rant, heh), but it's a hell a lot better than (liberal) indentured servitude 100k in debt and working as a waitress (they make around 200 a week 2.13 an hour with tips, calculate rent, utilities, food, unplanned children, taxes, car, gas, savings, medical, crushed dreams, and beer)

Stop worrying about the short term: Instagram, Facebook, getting drunk, getting laid... and worry about the important things. Once your future is secured, then do all the stupid shit you want. Wise up to the reality please and change your major or school or acquaint yourself with the reality of the American job market.
