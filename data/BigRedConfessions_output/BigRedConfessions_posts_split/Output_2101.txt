I am doing nothing with my life, but academics. I started to give up this semester land not study. I did horribly on my finals; my cs grade is especially horrendous. I am so lost. Part of me believes that I need help, but I feel that the stigma attached to that outweighs the benefits. Maybe I am alright after all, because there can't be anything wrong with me? I have gotten to this point without needing it, so why now? How could anybody help me anyways? I got this... I really don't know.
