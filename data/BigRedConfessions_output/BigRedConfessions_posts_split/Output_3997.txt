I'm terrified of turning 20. My birthday is approaching so rapidly, and I feel like I've done nothing in my teenage years. Completely wasted. I never had a rebellious phase, and I never really tried anything new. I stayed in my shell and watched the years go by. 20 years seems like such a dent in my life. It's so scary and I don't know what to do about it. I have no interest in celebrating, and I'll probabaly end up crying myself to sleep the night of my birthday.
