Every job I've gotten before was because of how attractive the manager thought I was. I remember during my last job my manager had a fight with the owner because he thought she hired me because of my looks. He argued with her that he thought I was too attractive for their business, and she argued otherwise. Physical appearance really does open up your opportunities, if you know how to use it right. It's a tool and a strategy, not just vain self investment.
