All humans are equal. Whether you're a girl, a guy, gay, straight, Mexican, whatever, you have the same right to opportunities as anyone. No one is intrinsically better or worse. Period.

As a guy, I can attest to the fact that guys, by and large, get irritated by the feminist movement. Is it because we are misogynists and we hate women? Are we dicks? I don't think so. We don't like it because girls constantly bring it up. They use it as a crutch. Maybe they don't intent to do that, but that's the way it comes out. Sometimes it even comes out as an attack against men. I know this may not be the intention, but its true. If you want equality, then just be equal. Try your hardest in life. That's what guys do. Let me tell you a story about this girl from my high school (I will call her girl X). 

X was a freaking genius. X was amazing socially. She had tons of girl friends, tons of guy friends, everyone respected her. She was getting amazing grades and she's always so nice. But she was different. She never brought up feminist issues. She never acted like she was disadvantaged because of her gender, because she wasn't. She just gets work done and succeeds at what she does. All the guys respect her. No one thinks she any less equal. X is one of my best friends. 

X is an example of how women should approach gender equality. They shouldn't constantly bring up the issue and demand equality. Work your hardest and be yourself, then society will naturally confer equality onto you. I promise you. I'm a guy, I'm friends with a lot of guys. You can take my word for it. This wasn't the case in the past, but I truly believe that nowadays it is become more and more the case. 

I know people will dismiss my opinion, but that's all it is, my opinion. Take it or leave it. Moral of story: try your hardest and be yourself. Guys don't think women are intrinsically worse. I swear. We just get irritated about how they always bring up race.
