"Once all this darren wilson and eric garner thing dies down (which will, like it did with Trayvon Martin), all this ""college social justice"" warriors will go back to their everyday life, feeling better about themselves, and feeling ""they did something.""

However, the lives of many ""lower class"" citizens will remain unchanged, regardless of how much you protest, most of the people (not all of course) are doing it because the media brought attention to it, and because of ""peer pressure."" However, if you really cared about black lives, why I dont see all the people fiercely protesting and yelling about these injustices in the local YMCA, or in the poor black (or hispanic) communities helping kids out who dream with education, yet cant get it. Not only because of lack of opportunities, but lack of education provided by both their parents and their schools.

If all this effort in ""police brutality"" protests was put into educating and inspiring the kids who truly need it, we would be living in a different america by now, but hey that is how college kids work.

I just want to invite all of you who really believe in the causes you are fighting for, to not only ""protest"" but take action in the communities that NEED your help. because change doesnt start at the top, but the bottom. The situation in these communities cries for help. Heck, while living in there, I was more scared of my own peer than the police, but thankfully I got the opportunity to come here, and now every time i go back, I go to talk and tutor the kids who are going through the same situation i went through.

I am in no way telling you to stop protesting, but to also be proactive in helping to change this place from its roots.

 Also, i have noticed that a lot of people are very reactive when it comes to this subject, which then leads to just a ""heated argument"" (more like yelling) from both sides with nothing discussed or changed. I just want to say something: ""hate only breeds more hate."" If you are not willing to break the cycle of hate, no one will. So i tell you, please, unite and cooperate, accept different view; understand and discuss; dont just go around yelling your opinion while covering your ears. If you dont listen, the other person wont and nothing will be changed. If we want change we need to unite  and work together, not ake people work for each other, only then things will get done.

/just my two cents. good luck with finals

tl;dr we must stop dividing each other and work together towards something better."
