Crystal Light, Mints, Water, Green Tea, Splenda... Part of my list of safe "foods." Foods I consume when my ED thoughts are strong. Part of me hopes my roommates will notice and help me, but the other part of me wishes they'll never notice so I can stay in control. Having an eating disorder is hell.
