Please don't let the media be your source of knowledge on Islam. Talk to many Muslims, read the Quran (you have nothing to lose), ask about the parts that don't make sense to you, and please don't hate blindly. Muslims worldwide are also suffering from the disgusting acts of violent extremists claiming to represent a religion practiced by 1.6 billion people. Muslims are a part of our community and deserve to be respected like everyone else. Peace :)
