Person with the shit colored dog... how the **** did Cornell let you keep that thing in public spaces when there are students who have severe allergies to dogs? That thing caused me hives. Fuck you. You shouldn't be allowed to keep a PET--I doubt that thing even does useful services--when they cause this degree of distress to your peers.
