I fucking hate my computer and I want to sledgehammer it.  Fuck.  

Okay.  I feel a little bad saying I hate it, but I'm really not happy with it right now.  I saved a goddamn word document.  I HIT SAVE.  And then I went to submit said word document on blackboard, AND I COULD NOT FIND SAID WORD DOCUMENT ANYWHERE ON MY COMPUTER.  Not in downloads, not in documents, not in trash, not in the spotlight search.  

I guess my confession is that I have a mac.  :'(
