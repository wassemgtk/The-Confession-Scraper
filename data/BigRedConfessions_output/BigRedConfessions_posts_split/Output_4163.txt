"I met this girl in her freshman year. and we were on and off until her late sophomore year due to stupid things, mainly my own demons and fear to be attached. After that, I realized how much I love her, and as time went on, without exaggeration, I could not see myself with anyone else. Everything then felt right.

We still dated until one day, after leaving the hill, she gave up. I wish I could have been my best from the beginning, so the past would not haunt and bring doubts. I truly saw more than a college girlfriend or a ""nice"" memory in her. Perhaps, the story would be different now. "
