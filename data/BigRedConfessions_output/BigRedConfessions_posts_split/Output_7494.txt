To the exotic brunette girl in my macro lecture: You are so gorgeous, and seeing you makes me happy. I'm afraid of talking to you because I know everyone wants you, but I just think everything about you is beautiful; your hair, your style, your face, your body, and even your cute accent! I'll talk to you one day, I know I will when I get enough courage to do so. Maybe I'll try talking to you when we're getting lunch at Oaks after lecture...
