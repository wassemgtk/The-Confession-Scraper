I don't particularly see myself as someone who is all that needy for attention. In spite of all the sexual, physical, and verbal abuse I've taken and seen since I was a child, I have never asked for academic concessions or better treatment from anyone on the basis of my suffering. But I do seek out and appreciate help when I'm going through dark cycles of thought and I get lost in a depression. But lately I've come to realize how shitty humans can be to each other. You really can't expect mercy from anyone in this world. The only person you can rely on is yourself. All that matters in this pitiful existence is somehow achieving a position of power in which you can protect yourself from the insults and actions of others. I've learned my lesson. Love and loyalty are both traits to be exploited by the strong, and should not be espoused by the weak.
