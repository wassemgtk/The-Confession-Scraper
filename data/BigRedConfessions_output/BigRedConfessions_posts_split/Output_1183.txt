My father punched me on the face when I was 14 years old, almost breaking my nose. He used to hit me when I was a kid too, but because of my culture, everyone justified what he did as "Oh, our parents used to do that to us too, and now look at how we ended up!". But I didn't like it. It always hurt really badly, and I don't appreciate being hit/touched by an older man. I don't think it ever made me a better person, and although he hasn't hit me since (he has come close to it sometimes when I'm at home on top of screaming at me, or when I had to defend my sibling who he was about to hit once) I'm still very much afraid and angry at him. He's making me feel guilty for not being a good daughter that cares about him. I do care about him a lot. Honestly I don't want anything to do with him now though, and I don't know who to turn to. I don't want another person to tell me to forgive him just because he's my father, because part of me is done with that. Then again, I don't want to leave my father either. I don't want to go back home.
