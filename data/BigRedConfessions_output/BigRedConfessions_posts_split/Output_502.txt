I feel like I've been depressed and suicidal for a long time, but haven't really told anyone around me because I don't want to be a burden. I think my friends see me as normal on the outside, but really I am just so tired all the time. Every morning, I wake up, my body aches and I have to talk myself into why it would be worthwhile to get out of bed. Right now I feel as if the only reason I am chugging on is just until I outlive my parents so that they can't see the mess of a human being their son has become. I can't stand to have them thinking that they have failed as parents. I've basically lost all hope of having a normal life with a girlfriend, family or any sort of normal relationships, and am just waiting until I can pay of my debts so I can go away in peace.
