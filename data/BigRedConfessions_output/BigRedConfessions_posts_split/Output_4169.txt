"My life consists of chronicles of constricted experiences, muted emotions, missed opportunities, and unfulfilled expectations. I'm now stuck in a daze of rushed emotions. Yet they aren't senseless for once. I've been hiding away from everyone around me, caving in on myself. You should know where I'm coming from. I see myself when I look and speak to you. I feel the weight you carry. What would you say if I told you I would never hurt you? Please speak up, I'm built up on bruises, scabs, calluses.

Touching you is becoming so addictive, it has the healing power I've been searching for. I've known you before I've ever met you. This certain romance is fucking with my head. You've already shown me your world, you just need to let your heart step forward for you.

I can't fucking deal with this waiting game anymore. I want to feel you again. I want to know more of you, sink into the cavern you put yourself in.
