"Dear Boy,

I saw you for the first time today since the really bad thing happened.  I've been avoiding just the random chance sighting because I knew it would hurt since I don't know what's up.  But after being told you needed more time away from me this was more painful than I think you can imagine.  I couldn't look at you.  Even just glancing at you and walking past you was enough to make my heart try to leap out of my chest and my eyes fill with tears.  I don't even want to know what it would've been like to look up.  

Not talking to you kills me.  I know you aren't sure what you want.  That I frighten you.  And that's okay, because I'll take you in whatever way I can have you as long as it involves ridiculous texts at three in the morning like it used to.  My friends keep telling me to move on, and if I could I would.  But I can't.  I'm in love with you.  This isn't like any of the other times I've liked boys.  They've never made my heart race like you do--and certainly not six months after I'd known them really well.  They've never worried about me like you do, they've never made me laugh like you do.  I'm in love with you, and that's not something I can turn off.  

And I want to tell you all this, but I don't know where you are.  You won't tell me and the messages that you're sending are so mixed I'm having problems telling up from down.  And I'm a pretty dense person when it comes to receiving signals if you recall.

But I need you to know that I miss you.  When you aren't around for long periods of time I feel like a part of me is missing as cheesy as that sounds.  I miss your self-deprecation and the way you used to tease me.  We had such an easy back and forth since the moment we left.  

I'd give anything for you to hold me right now.  

Yours still,
Your Girl "
