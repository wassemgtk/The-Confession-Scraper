"After many hours of excessive coding, I've succeeded in making my final project for a CS class into the most annoying game I've ever seen. Just for the cruelty, there is terrible background music and there is no mute button. The ball occasionally explodes when it hits something, taking out a ton of bricks (yay!) or a chunk of your paddle (boo!). Some bricks are trick bricks and will never disappear. Did I mention my selection of trippy background images?

Is annoying the TA's to death considered worthy of bonus points?"
