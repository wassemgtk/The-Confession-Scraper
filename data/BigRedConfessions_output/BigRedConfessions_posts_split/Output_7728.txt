"To you,

Messy wavy dark hair that a broom couldn’t sweep in place,
But my fingers can
You’re a green eyed Jew
Wish you liked me too 
Can’t believe I feel this way
When I didn’t, I shouldn’t, I couldn’t
When we kissed I felt nothing
Not the sparks I felt with that other guy
But that doesn’t mean I didn’t want to try
You gave up so easily,
I want someone who stays
Someone who cares about me, puts up with my ways 
You pulled back, I pulled in
Wish my heart was made out of tin
God’s trying to tell me liking you is a sin
This hurts more than when I played soccer and was kicked in the shin
I didn’t do anything wrong, 
 Besides take my time, a little too long
But now these feelings are strong
I want you to go back to thinking I was pretty and witty
Not trash on the streets of an urban city
Can you do that?
Or will you leave me hear lying flat?
I’m worth it, I’m worth it, I’m worth it
All of the craziness I put you through, all of the shit
But baby, if you show me you care, you’ll never have to guess
Because although I’m careless, I never care less.

From, 
Me"
