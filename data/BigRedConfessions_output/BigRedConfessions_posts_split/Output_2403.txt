I wish to say that I really like him. Literally we are friends and  we have been taken some classes together, interacting with each other on Facebook and other SNSs, and we sometimes hang out with other friends together. I realized that for a long time I've been trying to avoid eye contact with him, and I dare not even stare at his photos for more than 2 sec. A brief encounter with him on campus makes my whole day, and a short dialogue with him turns my whole week upside down. Yet I'm always so nervous when there is a chance of meeting him. I hesitate on telling him about this, because I don't want to risk my friendship with him. Both of us are graduating and I wish I could make some changes, or at the very least ask him out just to consolidate friendship. But I really hate myself being too scared to do any of these.
