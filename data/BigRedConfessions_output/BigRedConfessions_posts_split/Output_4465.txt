One of my parents and their friend came to visit over the weekend and despite having a lot of homework to do, I spent my entire Saturday and half of Sunday showing them around campus. I originally planned to spend this weekend doing as much as I could on a project because I didn't do any of it last week so now as a result, now I am stressing out about finishing this CS project on time. I had anticipated this, but didn't want to ruin the mood that my guests were having because of my selfishness so I didn't say anything. I appreciate them coming and visiting me and bringing me snacks from home. Throughout the weekend, I had to put on a face that seemed excited and carefree and eager for them to be here and not mention how much work I had, but I honestly would have rather them not come because now I am feeling really stressed. I also feel really conflicted inside because I am disappointed in myself for thinking this and know that my parent and parent's friend would have be so heartbroken to hear this. From an objective point of view, I am just wasting my time writing this confession when I could be finishing coding (which I was working on earlier) but it is so hard to keep my mind off how conflicted I feel inside and how difficult it is to see my code past the wall of tears in my eyes.
