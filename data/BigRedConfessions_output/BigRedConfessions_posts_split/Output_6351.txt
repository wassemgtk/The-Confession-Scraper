the guy who swipes people in at bethe's dining hall is so rude. i've tried every week to say hello/thank you, smile etc and he glares at me and doesn't say a word. my friends have all said they feel like they get their souls sucked away when they interact with him. here's a crazy idea: if you hate interacting with people so much, get a new job that doesn't require you to interact with anyone (ex. behind the scenes at the dining hall or just a new job in general)
