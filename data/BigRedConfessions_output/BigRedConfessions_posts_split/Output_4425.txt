I didn't have a girlfriend for the past two years. I came to Cornell and found you. Now it feels like you're using me. You dont seem to want a real relationship and you never make time for me, you always make me make time for you. I refuse to be a hookup. I spent two years avoiding things like this. If you don't want to be in a mutual, emotional relationship, then why should I give you anything? I sympathize with the rest of the love/relationship posts on here.
