Considering being a lot more pretentious as of next semester. Not in a bad way though, more as like just increasing the amount of confidence I show. I guess I really need to start standing up for myself and carrying myself more highly. It would only raise my self-esteem that has recently hit rock bottom. I have nothing to be ashamed of, therefore, why not? Those who deserve my kindness will have it. Those who don't will see a very different side of me. Sure beats sitting here sulking about things....f**k that.
