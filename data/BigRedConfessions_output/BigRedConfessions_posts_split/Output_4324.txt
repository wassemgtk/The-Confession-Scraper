I just want you to know that I haven't stopped thinking about you. From gazing up at the stars on Libe Slope together to hanging out and talking in my room until we could hear birds chirping, we had such fun times--and those memories will stay with me forever. I was too insecure back then, and I think you were too, since you could've made a move so many times but never did.. and that frustration drove me to pursue someone else. I'm sorry if I hurt you. I'm glad to see that you have a girlfriend now, and I hope she gives you the love that you deserve. I wish it wasn't too late for me to give you that now, but I really wish you two the best. You honestly were one of the best guys I'd met here at Cornell.
