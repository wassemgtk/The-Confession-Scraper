I believe that I am a pretty confident person in both my appearance and intelligence, however I can't seem to not feel insecure. I really, really wish I didn't feel this way, but I can't help it when I look at girls that guys find super hot. What makes it worse is the guy I'm currently hooking up with, hooked up with the typical very attractive blonde with a perfect body last semester and now he's kind of pushing me off, but I can't help but feel that he wouldn't push me off if I was as attractive as she was. I hate how we live in such a shallow world and I hate even more the fact that I let it affect me :(
