It's not that I don't appreciate all that my parents have done for me. It's not that they don't love me. But they're just not *supportive.* My mother is more direct about it, constantly pushing me to change majors, change schools, find a boyfriend. She recently notified me that all her friends and family think I'm selfish, foolish, and entitled (as if that should mean the world to me and convince me to discard my set of values and replace it with hers...she actually believes that their opinions justify her disdain for me when all they've ever heard about me are her tirades). My father seems to support me but I keep forgetting that he only voices his support as a way of spoiling me, or at least that's how he sees it. Anytime I voice an opinion that's different from his own, he becomes a defensive, angry monster--"You're just a little girl! You know nothing! You just need to accept that I know more than you! Im not disrespecting my newly devout Hindu friend by sneaking beef into his food and then laughing about it when he spits it out!  It's not discriminatory to say that Jews can't be trusted, it's just their culture! It's not homophobic to say that it's not natural for men to do ballet! Look, the house is a mess. What kind of a girl are you? Do your job first before you criticize me. You need to show some respect!" My life goals don't include wealth, a husband, and two children, and I hate being vilified for that.
