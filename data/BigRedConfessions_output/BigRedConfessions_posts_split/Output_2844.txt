Every year someone on this campus passes away. I don't really get why people who have never met them get all sentimental. I don't understand why they judge me for not being the same. I'm not saying that I was happy and I'm not trying to be a jerk, but it's very difficult for me to comprehend this. Yeah, I mean.. people die. What's so special about people?
