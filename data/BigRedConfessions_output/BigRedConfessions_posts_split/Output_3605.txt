Whenever a friend or family member wrongs me in some way, I make a list of all shows, books, and movies they're interested in. I set out to find the plot and endings of all of the items on the list. Then I compile a second list containing the details I gained from my investigation. After cornering my unsuspecting prey in a room where he or she has no way out, I slowly let loose the details from my lips. They all resist in the beginning--trying in vain to drown out my words with their screams, covering my mouth with their lips, trying to find a way out of the locked room, etc. But in the end I always win. I always leave them lying on the floor trembling with indignation, sobbing in mental anguish, screaming WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT??? It's great fun.
