Women have this incredible power over men in that they are bottlenecks/gatekeepers of men's horniness and desire for emotional attachment. They get to decide -- I'll let this one talk to me, I'll shut this one down, and the other 95% interested I'll send mixed signals to, and I'll date this one for 4 dates and then out of nowhere stop communicating, etc. Sexually frustrated men are a force to be reckoned with, and a lot of suffering in the world is the direct or indirect product of that. To men it's similar to starvation and they either destroy themselves or others if they can't get ahead in the competition for women. But beware ladies, because a day will come when guys will figure out a way to circumvent this issue - the sex aspect, the emotional comfort aspect, and possibly even the reproduction aspect, and when you're put in direct competition with man-made (literally) technology, you'll see all the social equality progress to go crap, and without your biological value you won't be left with much. And that may just be the end of our civilization. So don't abuse your power... Be straightforward, date the ones you like, be less ambiguous with those you don't, and help us minimize relationship and sexual frustration, because that may just end humankind.
