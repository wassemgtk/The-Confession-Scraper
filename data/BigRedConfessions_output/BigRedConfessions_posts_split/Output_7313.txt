"To all the guys complaining about how no girl wants a nice guy, there are two possibilities in your situation:

1. Did you ever stop to think maybe you're not as ""nice"" a guy as you think you are?
2. If you truly are a nice person, I'm very sorry you've had some negative experiences, but please do not judge an entire gender based on a few bad examples.  There are girls who will treasure your kindnesses or thoughtful actions.  Please don't be bitter and don't give up hope!"
