I was really really depressed this past semester, and thus took an Incomplete for a course I was taking in the Spring, on the condition that I complete the coursework (final exam) by the end of August. I had to spend all summer working, but I studied when I could (2-3 times per week), and this last month I've studied every day. I understand the material that is presented in the textbook and the questions that were presented in the discussion sections with no problem. But looking over the past prelims, I think I'm screwed. Now I'm supposed to take the final exam tomorrow. I think I'm going to fail, and I'm scared I'm going to be kicked out of Cornell. I know it's a bit early in the semester for people to sympathize with this, but here's hoping I get hit by a car. (Or a miracle happens.)
