I applied to over 5 groups/clubs on campus this semester, and I didn't get into a single one. I'm beginning to feel like I'm not good at anything I am interested in, and that I will never find a close-knit group of friends here at Cornell. I'm not a part of a single activity anymore and don't know where to go. I love this school and being here, but I think I'm just lost.
