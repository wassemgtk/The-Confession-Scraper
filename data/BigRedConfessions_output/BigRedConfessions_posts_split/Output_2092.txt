White American girls are so hard to flirt with. At least that's been my experience. Maybe it's just Cornell and NYC which is where I've had experience. But international students or any non-white American girls are so much more open and social and you can just have a normal conversation with them. White American girls tend to be so particularly uptight and cautious. I actually feel like some stalker or a sex offender talking to them, just because they project that image on me. As soon as they detect I may be interested in them, the 9-foot brick wall goes up. I don't blame you, you're probably the most hit on demographic, but honestly, that definitely exists. I apologize if it's racist and/or in some other way offensive. I'm an American white guy for the record, so if I am being offensive, I extend some of that to myself. It's just an observation.
