"I decided to take a year off from Cornell (money problems, mental health issues). This past summer I cut off everyone I used to know because I'd like to enter school in the fall of next year a completely new person and find a new group of friends who actually care about me. 

Now that I'm coming to terms with what I did, I feel incredibly lonely and isolated. I just don't know if it's a good idea to reach out to anyone because I genuinely feel no one cares about me. I mean, my freshman year I felt left out, too, but I miss being around other people??? I'm really confused and sad. I also don't have childhood friends because I moved around a lot growing up. I haven't left my home since arriving in the summer. 

Any advice? Sorry for the jumbled confession..."
