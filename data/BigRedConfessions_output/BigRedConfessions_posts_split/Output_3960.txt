There are more neurons in head than galaxies in the sky and don't let anyone tell you it isn't gorgeous. Your eyes, your lips, your hands: all formed in the dying breaths of a great star billions of years ago. Your atoms will grace the universe for all of eternity, engaging in a billion trillion interactions before settling down into another formation. Against every odd the world could throw at us, you're here. You - yes, you - are a damn sexy human being.
