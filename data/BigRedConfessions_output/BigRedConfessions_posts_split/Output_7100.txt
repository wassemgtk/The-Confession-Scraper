I feel like forgetting what love is. I used to be very passionate when I was younger and hoped for a relationship that could last forever. College has been distracting, however, and all I cared was achieving academic and professional success. Now I feel like future is bright and I have indeed done some amazing things here; but looking back, there is something missing. I don't think I ever fell in love with anyone here. I can't find anyone attractive anymore. At Cornell, I learned to analyze, much more than to feel. I just became numb at the end of the day, did I?
