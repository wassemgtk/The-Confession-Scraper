I just want to be done with school so I can have a fun job and enjoy life without being tested.  Every time I take an exam it's like making a deal with the devil.  I'm giving up free time to participate in this societal standard to prove myself employable.  I just want to be outside!  MY TIME WILL COME.  IT IS NIGH.  I CAN SMELL IT.  Especially now that it's basically spring.  Life is a beautiful thing.
