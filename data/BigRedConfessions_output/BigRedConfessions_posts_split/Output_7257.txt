So there's this gorgeous girl whom I always see studying in Uris. Her hair is straight and golden, like the radiating sun and she has the prettiest light brown eyes I've ever seen in my life. She always wears this white, puffy coat with a furryish hood and I'm pretty sure she's from Cali just from looking at her. This girl is nothing like East coast girls. I just wish I could be brave enough to introduce myself to this goddess of the West Coast.
