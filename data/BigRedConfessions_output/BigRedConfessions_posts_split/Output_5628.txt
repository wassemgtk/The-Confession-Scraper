"To #2539,

There are myriad, truly a limitless number of reasons someone could be struggling with depression or suicidality. Please don't reduce any of our problems to something that can be fixed with ""one little effort"". I'm not even doubting that you struggled with actual depression, but its source might've been something you could do something about quicker or more easily than other people could. 

I agree that treatment would probably set someone struggling on a better path, but as someone who is currently on meds and in CAPS for years now, I honestly can't say too much about them being ""ridiculously good"" at what they do. And let's not even get started on those with limited access to health care (luckily CAPS fees can be waived, but medication costs cannot), or those with zero support systems or with families that stand in the way of getting treatment. As much as I want everyone to realize how precious life is and not give up, I also know that the fact that some live constantly on the brink of suicide doesn't necessarily mean they're not doing all they currently can about their problems.

Same goes for depressed people who post on this page. Granted, anyone struggling out there SHOULD seek treatment if they aren't already because you may be surprised by how treatable your issues actually are, and sometimes a slight boost in happiness is enough to pull you from the brink. But they should also feel free to use this page as an outlet, as opposed to bottling things up, especially if it's the only outlet they feel like they have."
