I've been in a long distance relationship for about a year now. It seems this year has been one crazy roller coaster ride of emotions for me. We've had plenty of ups and downs, but after one year, we are still pulling through. However, it definitely has not been an easy journey for the both of us. Because of finances, especially for him, we cannot afford to see each other as much as other couples do. While couples sometimes can meet some weekends, go on fancy dates, plan exciting things to do together, for us, because of distance and money, we can only afford to see each other once every couple months if we are lucky. Especially for him, it is very hard to come visit me here because he works full time, pays his own tuition, will soon pay for his own housing, and he can barely afford all of this on his own. Therefore, the few times we do get to spend together are so special for both of us, and we make the most of the little time we can be with each other. On top of that, there's also this issue of his low self esteem, and low motivation to finish school. He is having a lot of trouble getting through college because he doesn't have the confidence to get through because of past depression issues. He told me recently that if he had not met me, he would have dropped out of college already and would be spending his life working many jobs to support himself. But because of me, he is trying to motivate himself to finish school, and make something of himself, which I am truly humble and moved by.
Upon hearing our situation, which I'll admit is very difficult for me, some people would tell me to move on, the long distance is hard, it probably won't go anywhere, you're hurting yourself, he's not worth this emotional heartbreak, you're young you can meet so many people here who can love you etc. Yes, it's true there are so many wonderful men here I have the opportunity of meeting without dealing with the heartbreak of long distance, but truth is, I will not give up on him even with the difficulties we face. I'll always love him even if he can't afford to see me often, even if it takes him many years to finish school and get his degree, even if we can't go on fancy dates like other couples can do. Through all his imperfections and struggles, I'll always be there for him and care about him, just like I know he is to me. We don't choose to be in any relationship for the sake  of saying you are in one. We choose to be in one because of the deep trust, love, and compassion that both people feel for one another, no matter the circumstance. For me, I fell in love with someone who unfortunately lives in another city. Even through the tears of missing him, this journey and experience is something I won't regret, because I'm experiencing this with him, and together, there's no other place I'd rather be in.
