Im going to get my professional degree and my boyfriend is still deciding what he want to do before med school. I just want him to know that even if we are really far away, I still want to be with him.  Because I'd rather call him and text him and have dates over skype then not have him in my life at all. 1 year, 2 years, babe I love you and in the end, out lives will cross paths again, we are just going down opposite sides of a roundabout right now ( a roundabout that eventually moves us forward together)
