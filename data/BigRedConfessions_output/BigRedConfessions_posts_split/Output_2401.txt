My friend is poor and I have to constantly degrade myself because I don't want my friend to feel like shit. I always tell my friend that I am middle class and that my family is doing okay but if my friend knew how wealthy I was I don't know if they would want to hang around me. I don't know what to do but its eating me up living a lie inside as my parents get me anything I want and my friend always wonders where I get the money from. My parents set up an investment plan for my future so I may never have to work a day in my life and I don't want my friend to find out. I don't want to hurt anyone's feelings and I want to help my friend but they never want anything from me even though I assume they may be in a less fortunate situation based on the complaints I hear. What to do? I can't stand spending another year like this here.
