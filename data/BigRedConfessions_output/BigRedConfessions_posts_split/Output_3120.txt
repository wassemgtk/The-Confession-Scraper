I try to do work, but I can't get you out of my damn mind! I've LITERALLY spent all day just looking at your pictures and posts on social media and rereading your cute texts you've sent me. I've already imagined our first date, wedding day, and our whole life together. Hell I'm writing about you in a confession because I want to document this if we ever do get married.
Is it normal to be so obsessed with someone that you put off all homework and commitments just to think about them? 
Worst part is I know you'd never like me back! You're fucking gorgeous and I'm just a Jewish boy with confidence issues. I don't even blame you for not liking me. I might sound pathetic, but I just want you to be mine so badly. Is this true love or just an unhealthy infatuation?
