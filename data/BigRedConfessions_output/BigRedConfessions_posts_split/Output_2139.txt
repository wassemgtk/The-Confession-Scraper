As an engineering student, I've never taken an exam and thought to myself "I got that question right because I studied that." The exams for some classes seem to be really unrelated to what was supposed to be on them.

In short, test scores to me don't seem like a direct result of how much I studied. I'm not saying that I don't study, I am merely suggesting that there's only so many ways to study for tests in some engineering courses. Studying until the wee hours of the morning seems pointless, and there is a point in time when I do study that I think "It's time to stop, studying any more than I already have isn't going to help." It's the same principle as "I'm drunk and having fun, and a couple more won't do much else besides make me pass out .
