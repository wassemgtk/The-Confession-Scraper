I'm going off the deep end. Every weekend I drink more and more. Every morning I struggle away from the urge to take a couple shots just so I'll have the courage to get through the day. I can't tell my friends whats happening. I'm so scared that they'll abandon me like the last ones did. I can see you judging me even from far away and I know I shouldn't care but I do. You always happen to see me on my worst nights and it only makes you think less of me. It's a cycle. I'm drowning myself in liquor to feel numb and when I'm drunk I add even more shit to the list of things I wish I could forget. When you say you hate yourself people assume you're joking and laugh. I mean it more and more every time. I know I'll just make more mistakes but I can't wait until the next time I can blackout because then I won't care what you think of me.
