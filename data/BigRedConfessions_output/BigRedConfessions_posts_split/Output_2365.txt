Im in a relationship but every few months feel the need to fuck a random person.  I always use protection with the stranger. :(  I barely enjoy it but just feel the need for the excitement and the hunt.  I love my partner and dont want to hurt them but I just need to do this every now and then.  In actuality, it makes me love them more.  Am I a bad person?  :( :(   Like how do you tell your partner you want a partially open relationship?  I wouldnt mind if they did the same thing too :(  I just dont want to lose them or hurt them
