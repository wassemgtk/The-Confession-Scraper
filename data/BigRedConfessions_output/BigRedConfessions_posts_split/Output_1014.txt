I'm starting to identify as non-binary but I'm not telling anyone. Frankly, it doesn't need to be said. My pronouns are the same, my style is the same, and everything is the same but some days I feel like less of a woman than I "am". I don't want to tell them because it doesn't affect them at all. Unfortunately, I feel like I'm keeping a huge secret from everyone I love.
