No disrespect, thank you for your service and congratulations. However, you're probably a white male and have the privilege to make the statement that one can have a great life without a college education. Unfortunately,  black men like myself are at risk without a college education. Ultimately our "American Dream differs based on our racial group. I don't make the rules, just telling it like it is.
