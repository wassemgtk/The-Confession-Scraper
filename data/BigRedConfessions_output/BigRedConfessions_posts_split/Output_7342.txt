"I truly am so alone. I only talk to the people who are forced to be around me. i'm tired of not knowing how to make friends. or not be awkward around the people who are required to be around me. i'm so scared for the time when people will no longer be forced to be around me, and I won't be able to talk to anybody.

once i'm 21. i'm buying alcohol and am going to kill myself by alcohol poisoning. or if i find a gun, i will shoot myself. i can't do this much longer. the motions aren't fun anymore. the end result desolate, isolated and bleak. 

goodbyel, farewell and amen. if only i had an ending as fitting as the end of that movie. "
