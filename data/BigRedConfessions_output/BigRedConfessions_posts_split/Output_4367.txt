When you climbed trees with me that one day, I felt a connection I've only ever felt with wood before. You remind me of the clouds in the sky, so pretty but always too far away, I would like you in my tree nice and close and away from everyone else. You are the leaf to my branch, the hearth to my stone, I love you.
