i hate how people act like the racial issue in america is complicated or nuanced, or needs some sort of a dialogue to get resolved. We dont want to compromise, we dont want your opinion, or your two cents, or your input. just fucking listen. stop letting police officers get away with shooting unarmed black people in the street and then claiming the victim was "no angel". Stop passing minorities over for jobs we are more than qualified for. stop flying confederate flags and saying its "southern heritage" or the "southern way of life" because we all know what that fucking means. You say we always talk about race? we'll stop when you fucking listen
