I completely bombed an interview for a job I really wanted, and I'm so embarrassed about how poorly I did. I don't know how long it's going to take me to get over this, but I feel absolutely horrible. Most of my embarrassment comes from the fact that these were "easy" questions catered to my areas of strength, but I was unable to give quick/polished answers because I did not have sufficient time to prepare. As expected, the rejection letter came fairly quickly. At least the interviewer and I were both on the same page with regards to that.
