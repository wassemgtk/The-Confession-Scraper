To commenter Nathan in response to my OP #7565. I think you missed the point I was trying to make. It was meant as humorous commentary about the frequent posts comparing past Cornell generations to your own. The Nirvana and flannel statement was an over-generalization. Not everyone of my generation liked Nirvana or wore flannel, which itself was also commentary on the tendency of people to generalize entire generations  Get it now?
