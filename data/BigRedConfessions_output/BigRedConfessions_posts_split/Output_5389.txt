Something tells me you'll be popping the question to her soon, and I have no idea how to brace myself for the inevitable pain that it will bring for me. I quite seriously don't know what I'm going to do or how I'm going to react if you guys get do engaged soon, I haven't fully regained my shit from the last time you hurt me... I guess on the bright side, I might finally 100% get over you like I should've a long time ago. But I'm not looking forward to the very messy and lengthy recuperation process I'm in for, because it will be just the most devastating blow.
