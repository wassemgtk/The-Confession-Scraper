I don't see any future with my boyfriend, but I don't know if I can break it off.  It's like I'm afraid of being alone, especially after being with him for a year.  Sure, there are times when I think, "hey I see it, I see a possibility."  But there are so many more times when I'm not even sure I love him, or even if we love each other in general.  I think we're both afraid of ending it.
