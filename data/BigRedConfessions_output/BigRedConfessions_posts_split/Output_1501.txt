I am beginning to believe someone is having the time of their life trolling this page. Whoever it is knows that most people at our school (or at least I hope) don't tolerate prejudice, false information, and other sorts of bullshit. We will comment on these posts, correct the mishap, and defend our own beliefs. Whoever thinks it's funny to provoke commenters by posting ridiculous rants on this page is not only totally childish, but a complete jerk for trivializing the issues that Cornellians care about.
