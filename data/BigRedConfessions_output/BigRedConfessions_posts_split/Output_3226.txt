The knowledge that nothing lasts forever is keeping me from fully enjoying what we have. I know, better to have loved & lost than never to have loved at all, but there are just so many variables that destroy love and it is hard to handle. I'm scared of the day when I allow myself to get attached and you say adios sucker. Things honestly seem to good to be true and I can't help but be a major skeptic. I've been lied to and manipulated before and while I can tell you're different, I know you still have the capacity to hurt me. I can't help thinking this is all a joke or a ploy even though at the same time I know I'm deserving of something real like this.
