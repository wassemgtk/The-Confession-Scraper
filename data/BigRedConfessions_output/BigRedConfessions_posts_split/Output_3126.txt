I've had just a shitty year and it's spilling over to this year as well. So many things have happened to me and they've turned me completely cynical and sad and negative and my friends pretty much expect me to just get over it like it's not important.

I know I shouldn't wallow in my misery, and I try really hard to move on and focus on the future, but every time sadness hits and I try to talk it out with a friend or someone they just give me pitiful looks and act like I'm a drama queen and like whatever I'm feeling is not important.

I just wish my "friends" appreciated me for who I am and realized that I can't be happy all the time. I'm sorry I have feelings and I'm sorry I confide in you.
