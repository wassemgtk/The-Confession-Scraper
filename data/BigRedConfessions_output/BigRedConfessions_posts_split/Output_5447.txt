I started dating a guy early last semester and a few months later we ended things on a bitter note because he didn't like the fact that I was graduating and moving to a different city for grad school. The break up was really tough on me. A few days ago, right as I had started to heal, we got in touch again and he wants to work things out between us. I don't know what to do..
