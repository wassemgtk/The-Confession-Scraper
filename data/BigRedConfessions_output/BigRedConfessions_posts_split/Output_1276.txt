I know you're just venting but trust, me don't sell your pursuits short. Practicality has its place, but we need people with passions. You are fortunate that you've found out early what you love to do. There are plenty of ways that you can combine your talents and love for your art with "practical" pursuits in order to earn a living and enjoy your life. You may not make a fortune, but enjoying your life and your work is so much more important. Trust me, some of those successful and practical people who are looking down from their penthouses will wish they had your life. Be authentic to yourself. Money is only important to the point that it provides your basic needs and a little extra. You do not need much more to be happy. Keep creating!
