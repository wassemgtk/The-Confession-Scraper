"My significant other is a senior and I am a junior. We have been together since my freshman year. Our relationship has proven to be strong. We've been through some tough times and a lot of happy times. We make a great team. 

But we both have dreams and ambitions. I am scared of what will happen after graduation. I imagine life a year from now, both of us having gone our separate ways. It not only saddens me, but scares me to death. This brought me to the realization that our relationship is a huge part of my big dreams and ambitions too. 

The uncertainty of it all has been getting to me lately. Can we make this relationship work? Because I certainly do not want to throw it all away. I will fight to the death for us, but only if you want to fight alongside me, too. I love you."
