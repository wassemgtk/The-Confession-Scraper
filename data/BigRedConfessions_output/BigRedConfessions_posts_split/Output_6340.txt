I can't stand the way we glorify the Willard Straight Hall takeover. They came in with guns and threatened to kill people who didn't leave the building. Would you support an "oppressed" group doing that today while you're eating in the Ivy Room or getting counseling at EARS? Imagine if you were crying your heart out from depression and a group of students opened the door  holding shotguns and they told you to leave the building. Is this really the sort of behavior we support?
