There's nothing wrong with me spending a night drinking beer, eating pizza, and watching independent films all alone, right? Maybe it would be more acceptable if I had a more "feminine" drink like wine? Drinking is drinking, I guess. 
Anyways who cares. I'm buzzed and excited for a new semester at Cornell! Scared of failure, but excited nonetheless
