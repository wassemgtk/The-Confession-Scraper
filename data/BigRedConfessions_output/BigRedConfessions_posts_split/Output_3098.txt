It is so sad how emotions between platonic friends could shatter the friendship. We were so close last semester, I would tell you everything, my hopes, my fears, my secrets, and you you would do the same. The thing is, I was in a relationship and you weren't. But because of emotions that started to arise, we both made mistakes that destroyed our friendship. I tried saving the friendship this semester, but I'm coming to the realization that the friendship we shared can never be the same. Every time I see you I am reminded of memories that I am trying to remove from my mind. How i wish I could go back in time to when me and you were just close platonic friends.
