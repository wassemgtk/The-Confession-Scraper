I oscillate between being invited out four times a week with guys who are (physically, at least) into me and not doing anything.  It's weird, because guys who invite me out, compliment me, buy me food, drive/carry me a few times a week and introduce me to their friends then drop off the face of the earth for a week or so.  I'm starting to wonder if anyone has ever actually been into me.
