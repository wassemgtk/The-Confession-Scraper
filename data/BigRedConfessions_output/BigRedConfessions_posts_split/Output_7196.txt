Blows my mind how quickly two strangers can become inseparable and then go right back to being strangers.  Even though I eventually got over the broken heart, hearing from you more than a year later just to catch up really made my week.  We'll never again be lovers, but we'll be always be each others first loves.  I can now look back on the relationship with happy memories knowing we can be friends again.  Something I thought I'd never be able to say.  Don't ever be afraid to reconnect! Obviously you liked the person for some reason even if you weren't meant to be together forever.
