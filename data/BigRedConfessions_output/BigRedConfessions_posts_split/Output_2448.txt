I'm anxious about a lot of things in my life, but dying alone is right at the top. It's honestly pathetic that I'm so caught up in finding someone, but if no ones ever wanted me before why would they now or ever? My friends say it's because I can come off as intimidating but I'm about as sensitive and emotional as it could get. I've even worked up the nerve to tell the boys I had crushes on that I liked them. Maybe people can just somehow sense the crippling insecurity underneath. Maybe I'm not emotionally ready for a relationship but if that's the case I'm not sure if I ever will be. I'm not looking for someone to "fix" me. I'm aware that only I can do that. But it'd be nice to have someone for support and to support in return. I want my first kiss and date with a boy who makes my face flush. I want someone to inspire me to do better and be better and I want to be someone's inspiration. I want to trace constellations on someone's skin and see the galaxies swirling in their eyes. I want them to tell me about their past and I want to kiss their wounds. I want blanket forts, late night marathons and sweet kisses that take my breath away. I want playful bickering, teasing and sarcasm. I want to keep saying "my boyfriend" until my friends and family go from fond exasperation to being flat out annoyed. I want someone to tell me that they love me, and I want to believe them. 

Maybe I just wouldn't be a good enough girlfriend.
