Hearing my friends playing board games and watching movies in the next room during finals week really pains me. It makes me wonder why I don't have the time to have fun. They're in difficult majors and they get great grades. I'm doing well grade-wise, but I often feel like I study more than other people. Am I just not as smart as my friends? Am I an inefficient student?
