You got back with him again. You are my best friend, and he used to be my close friend. He had been treating you like shit, not in the r/niceguys sense but like actual shit: insulting your family, your religion, cheating on you with your friends, and emotionally blackmailing you by threatening suicide and more histrionics when you were getting discouraged from what he did. You came to me so often so very depressed, and I'd do everything in my power to cheer you up and bring you back to the old self that I became friends with. He even interpreted that as "his friend moving in on his girl" or some BS and tried bringing me to the point that I had a lamp cord hanging out of my window during finals weekend and was about to go. The only reason why I didn't was because you found my goodbye message when I was on the windowsill.

I thought we were both free of him. You seemed so much more open, so happy, to the point that I really believed things were looking up not just for me, who turned my life around and removed him from it, but you too. Even though I try not to admit it and it undermines my stance, I kinda fell for you. Not that you'll ever know that again.

And then a few nights ago I check some social media I don't check often and see he's mentioning you casually just like he used to and things are okay again. "He doesn't really mean to hurt me when he does" this is the fourth time it's happened! Each successively time you fall harder, and now without my knowledge you've gotten back together with him? I get that I don't have to know everything about your life and I don't expect to, but I don't think I'm entitled in being told that you're getting back with a guy who has not ruined your life once but three times.

And now you act all distant again. I didn't try moving beyond friends out of respect for you: why did you let a guy who cheated on you and did all of this bullshit once again take your heart? At the very least I hope you can keep me as a friend, and even though I'm trying to move on from you and maybe love again in the future that doesn't mean I won't try to save you and be a pillar when you need it.

Good luck. You still have me and our friendship if anything happens.
