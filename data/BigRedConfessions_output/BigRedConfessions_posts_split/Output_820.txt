I'm so scared i'm not gonna get into Med school when I apply next year. I have a shitty gpa and I'm probably gonna do poorly on the MCAT. I know I want to be a doctor because I love talking to patients and getting their histories and listening to their worries and reassuring them and helping them to the best of my abilities. But I just don't care about the science behind it, I don't find classes like biochem interesting and I just can't force myself to sit down and study.
