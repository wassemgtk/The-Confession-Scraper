It's the end of my freshman year and I honestly feel like I wasted it all academically. I came in to Cornell thinking I could handle being pre-med in addition to my humanities major... got a D in chemistry and a C in biology last semester, and I anticipate similar grades this semester. My GPA is barely a 2.5. I forced myself to pursue subjects that I knew I didn't care for at all. Sure, next year I'll have a fresh start once I'm purely humanities and no longer have to struggle and cry my way through math problems or science textbooks, but that measly 2.5 will remain a dark cloud over my head as I work overtime in the next three years to recover from it. My friends are so successful--they ace their prelims, regularly score above the mean, and their biggest academic worry is getting Bs in classes that I would kill to have a B in. I don't think I'll get an A in anything this semester. I've never been more ashamed of myself. I've never been more afraid of my future.
