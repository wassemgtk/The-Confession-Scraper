The mob that conglomerated today by Bailey Hall shocked me. As an alumnus of this fine institution, and someone who actually donates money to the financial aid fund here, I felt very offended and  uneasy. Luckily one Cornell Police officer and one State trooper walked with me across the quad so that I could make it on my way without being hassled. All goes to show, remember who you display such offensive material to, as alumni like me are the ones who actually benefit students like yourselves and are the reason why Cornell is fortunate to have such an endowment that could go to financial aid for students. Charter Day was an event for a large number of alumni this weekend. The only persons that actually were affected by the demonstration were Cornell alumni and like I mentioned before those are the "good people" who actually make it easier for you to go here.
