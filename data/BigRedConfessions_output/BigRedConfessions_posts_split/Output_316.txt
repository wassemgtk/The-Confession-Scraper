I love Cornell so much, but I hate that they put upkeep on such a low priority. Paint coming off doors, showing the metal and years of dirt, clumps of hair that's all over the floors, the years of dust build up on top of the locks and under the baskets at Helen Newman, the old nasty floors and chairs literally coming out of their bolted-down spots in lecture halls. I know of at least one potential student who did not apply because of the impressions these things left on them. Clean it up Cornell!
