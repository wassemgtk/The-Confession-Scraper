Some of my friends and I are really into this one movie, for the sake of maintaining anonymity, I'll call it "movie y".  Other friends are constantly posting videos or articles to our pages like "have you seen/heard this thing pertaining to 'movie y'"?  I'll say this here rather than in person for the sake of not being rude.  While we appreciate the interest, the answer is "yes", we already have.
