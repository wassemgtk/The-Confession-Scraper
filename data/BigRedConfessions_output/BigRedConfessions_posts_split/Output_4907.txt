My younger sister has been in a serious relationship since she was 16, lost her virginity (later) at 16, and has continued dating this guy for a year and a half so far. I, on the other hand, had my first kiss this past spring, have only ever dated one guy, and am currently single. I know we are different people, but, god, how can I not compare myself to her?  I hate that she's the one who has to give dating advice to me, even though I'm older and partially done with college. Some times I feel this personally, like something must be wrong with me, but other times I just feel like I've failed as an older sister by not being able to give her advice about this sort of thing. I can't really change the situation at this point...
