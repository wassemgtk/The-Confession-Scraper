My lowest point so far just might be talking on the phone with my mom about not feeling good enough to be here and sobbing disgustingly whenever she says something encouraging while stuffing a pecan roll into my mouth because I haven't eaten all day, all while hiding in an empty classroom hoping nobody comes in and sees how gross this whole scene actually is. 

I feel a little better though, so there's that.
