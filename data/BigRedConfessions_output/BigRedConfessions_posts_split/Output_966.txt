If you're worried the way you're eating is disordered, there's a good chance it is.  It's great that you're aware of it.  There are counselors in CHEP (Cornell Healthy Eating Program) who are there just for this kind of thing - talking about concerns and whatnot.  Also, I have to say, you aren't your body!  I implore you to think about that.
