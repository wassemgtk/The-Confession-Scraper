I realized something really important today.  I don't respect myself. I don't respect my inner talent and/or the hard work it took to get here. And I hate those who respect or love me, because, deep down i don't know, I think I hate myself.  I feel like a fraud. So instead of sorting it out, I push people away, so that I can spare them the pain they'd feel if they tried to reach out to me.  I guess that is what people mean when you're surrounded by this inner darkness. Because no matter what choices you make, your darkness emits out of you like some catastrophically enormous black cloud.
