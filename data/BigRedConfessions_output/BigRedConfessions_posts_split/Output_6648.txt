I confess that I've started to use dating websites because I want to expand my horizons. There is not much diversity in the female population here at Cornell than I previously imagined. And it is true that we are living in "the Cornell bubble." I've been searching for the right woman who could understand me and I could relate to. It would be nice to have someone that I could take out on dates. But after hooking up, that's all that's left to do. Hook up, and then we drift apart. I want more than that. But...I can't find her. Maybe I just have to look elsewhere.
