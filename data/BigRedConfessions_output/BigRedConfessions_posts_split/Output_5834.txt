I tried drugs, I had a homosexual make-out, I'm drinking pretty much 5 days of the week, all part of the undergraduate experience right? Except I never did any of these things as an undergrad, all of this is happening now during my graduate experience.  I can't tell if I'm doing it wrong or right...
