Sometimes the difficult academics get to me and my lack of campus involvement makes me sad. So to the fratless anyone want to start a secret society with me. Yes, I have friends but I want to become closer to my class. This may be unnecessary and I should just meet people the normal way but sometimes I want something stronger.
