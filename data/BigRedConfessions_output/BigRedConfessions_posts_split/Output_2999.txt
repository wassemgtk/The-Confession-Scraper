Two words that I use to describe Cornell is inferiority complex. I honestly hate how we constantly compare ourselves to other universities, universities that we can easily agree are some of the best universities in the world (Harvard, Princeton, Columbia). On social media I constantly see people saying things like "safety school", or that other schools are easy and have joke workloads. I have friends that go to all of these schools, and they DO NOT GIVE A SHIT ABOUT US. Nowhere around Harvard do people say "safety school" or "fuck Cornell they're an easy school." This is embarrassing. If we are gonna have rival schools, fine, I'm all about school spirit, but when it comes to insulting the academic level of another elite institution, just stop.
