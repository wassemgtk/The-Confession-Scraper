"After thinking really long and really hard this whole summer, I've finally come to the decision that I will not be having children.

Maybe it seems weird that I've already decided that when I'm only in college and have a good few years before I finally have to start thinking about having a family, but this is necessary for me to feel sure and happy about my own future.

I used to get so anxious when I thought about life after college; I'd hopefully attend my preferred graduate school, move to an area with many opportunities in my desired field, enjoy life for a few years, and then... have a family? That was the part that panicked me. My 30's and 40's were suddenly not going to be my own to live, and I had only so much time to do what I wanted and 20 years were going to be given to someone else.

I want the time to go to the places I want to go and to pursue the interests I never had a chance to pursue because I had spent so much time focused on school. I want to live where I actually want to live and have the house that I've always imagined for myself. If I couldn't do this on my own I'd be fine with that; I'd know I wasn't doing enough. I'd be filled with so much regret if I knew I couldn't because I had to chosen to have children.

It didn't even occur to me until this summer that I could just... Not have any kids. Did someone tell me I had to? Is there some rule that everyone has to go through the motion of raising of a family? That you won't be fulfilled by not adhering to this social norm? No, there's not.

You can call me selfish, that I'll never understand true love until I have kids, that hormones will kick in and I'll change my mind. You know, maybe I will change my mind and I'll find someone that I want to raise a family with. But I am not selfish for choosing myself over a being that does not even exist in this world yet. I have the agency to make my own, rational decisions regardless of what my hormones tell me to do. Can't I argue that you're the selfish one for trying to make someone else live the life you want to live?

I still have a lot of research to do about long term birth control and even possibly surgery, but already knowing that this is the course I want to take with my life is finally, for ONCE, making me excited about my future."
