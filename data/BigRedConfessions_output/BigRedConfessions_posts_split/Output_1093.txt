I wish I had more friends. My first two years here, everyone was so much more friendly and open. As an upperclassman, I find that many of the people I used to talk to have trickled away and gone on with their lives. Now I'm only left with 1.5 good friends, a roommate who hates me, and acquaintances who may/may not speak to me if they see me. No matter how hard I try, I can't ever win in the social relationships department. Being an introvert truly sucks.
