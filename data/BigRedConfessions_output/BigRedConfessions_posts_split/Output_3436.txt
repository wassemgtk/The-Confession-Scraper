Cliched, I know, but I'm a virgin and I don't want to be anymore. I've never even kissed someone. The problem is, I don't want to lose it with someone I actually care about because then I'll worry if I'm "good" or not. Normally I'd just wait it out and go to more parties till I found that guy with the perfect balance between casual but not creepy but there's this guy I like so... I started a tinder and am now trying to identify if any of the guys would be non-creepy, non-stalker-y people who I could have a meaningless, casual hook-up with. I know that while not stick thin and gorgeous, I am pretty and guys have expressed an interest in dating me before... I just feel like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place right now.
