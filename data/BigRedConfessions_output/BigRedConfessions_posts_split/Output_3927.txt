An ode to CHEM 3530

So much writing and it ain't even good.
Words been pourin' out, but they ain't been understood.
My brain is trying its hardest
Just to soak up all it can.
I'll try to clear this up for you
so you can understand.
I'm writing, yes I'm writing, 
which I normally love to do.
But these things that I've been writing
have me feeling kind of blue.
I'm writing with lots of hopes and
I'm writing with lots of fears,
But most of all I'm writing
To do this semester what most do in one year.  (3530s, ya feel me?)
This is Cornell Confessions, you say?
Now hear me out, I'm not quite done.
I've felt quite smart until this day,
and now I feel quite dumb. 
All these kids, they seem to have it together.
Me?  I'm a recluse who reads alone in my room.
And on top of orgo, there's this fucking gloomy weather.
So basically, what I see is impending doom. 
But, alas!  I know this cannot last,
and I know I'm not alone.
This semester's winding down quite fast,
and soon I will be home.
