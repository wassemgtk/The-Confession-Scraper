I've been here going on four years. I took a few semesters off, battled chronic depression and anxiety, and questioned all my life choices daily. I was supposed to graduate May '14, then this upcoming May, and now it looks like it might even be December. I have been through a million challenges and wanted to just give up and go home so many times... And for the first time I'm truly glad I didn't. I'm finally starting to feel like "me" again for the first time in years, and I've allowed myself to connect to the campus. I'm happy and content for the first time in what seems like forever, despite still being in the middle of finals and personal challenges... And this is a pretty awesome realization for me. Keep pushing through guys... There is a point where things will turn around for you as they have for me. Also, don't be afraid to ask for help - I've had lots along the way. I hope everyone has a great break - I'm actually looking forward to going into one feeling this way. :)
