"I hope in a thousand years civilization will have progressed to the point where dating will be done in a much more efficient way. Because right now the mind games and the wasted time trying to figure out what's going on is unacceptable. In the end it ALL boils down to 1) whether the person is single and 2) whether they like you or not, and that is usually something they can tell the instance they see you. It's as simple as that. Anyone can look at a person and in 10 seconds say - yes, I'm interested or no, I'm not (and some apps have capitalized on this).

So wouldn't it be wonderful if we could just start with that right away, so we don't waste time getting lost between propriety/social contract and trying to read minds? I think most people would like to do that, but they're afraid of the embarrassment and awkwardness that will ensue. So I hope social norms eventually shift to where asking someone if they are interested in dating carries the same amount of social significance as asking them the time. Think how many people who are perfect for each other would find each other if that huge wall wasn't there. Just my vision for the future. :P"
