As a minority woman in a STEM field, I don't know how to feel about affirmative action. It has indisputably helped me. I have won awards and scholarships designated for females/minorities. I know that I probably would not have gotten accepted to Cornell if I were a white male. Yes - I believe I am qualified, but so many equally qualified people are rejected. 

I know affirmative action is designed to correct the supposed disadvantage I face. But I don't feel like I've faced any disadvantages in my life, only advantages. I've never been the only girl in my hard science/math classes. I've never felt looked down on or had people assume that I'm stupid or can't do math. Yet I have received opportunities purely for being a minority women. The thing is, I know many (most?) females and minorities do face this issues. They deserve AA, but I don't. 

I watch my (white male) friends struggle to find scholarships or internships. I'm not saying its easy for me - it isn't. But it is undoubtedly easier for me than it is for them. Some companies, like Google, have designated women/minority internships. Far more have quotas. Quotas that I fill. I know that I am qualified, but still, why me? and more importantly,  if I am filling that quota, am I taking the spot from somebody who actually deserves that spot? Somebody who did face disadvantages but prevailed?
