Ok here goes my first confession. I came in my dorm building so drunk last weekend that I walked into the wrong room, took a stranger's toothbrush, brushed my teeth, went back into his room, laid down on his bed and was about to fall asleep...when my friend called me saying he was standing outside my room and I wasnt opening the door. I looked around and realized I was in the wrong room. so awkward. So...obviously... I went in his refrigerator, took a can of Monster then I stole his deodorant by hiding it under my shirt (I don't know why I did that) and found my way to my room. Bro, you have no idea how sorry I am about that.
