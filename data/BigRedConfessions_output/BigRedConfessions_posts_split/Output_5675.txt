Do people just not look up when walking anymore? I feel like half the people I come across are glued to their phone, texting, and bump into people because they don't pick their head up. It's a little ridiculous. The other day, I saw someone almost get run over because they were glued to their phone instead of looking both ways before crossing. And then they got mad when the car swerved and honked at them.
