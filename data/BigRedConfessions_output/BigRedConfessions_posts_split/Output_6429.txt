"I never do this, but I feel like I have something to offer, so here goes. This is a long one, but I beg you to read it if it relates to you.

IF YOU BELIEVE YOU ARE DEPRESSED (ACTUALLY CLINICALLY), I.E. YOU DON'T WANT TO LIVE ANYMORE, LIFE IS A STRUGGLE, ETC., DON'T WAIT AROUND AND PRETEND THAT YOU'RE OKAY; SEEK TREATMENT. Damn, I don't know how many times I need to remind myself that I was so dumb for not seeking treatment immediately.

Depression is a real illness that ultimately manifests itself as severe feelings of emptiness that you cannot escape. Whatever the reasons that spur depression, depression becomes this irrational, out-of-control sense of sadness that you cannot overcome on your own. The depression then self-perpetuates and can come in swings (depressive episodes) but will ultimately come up and infect you. When it becomes irrational, seek treatment immediately.

Damn it, my freshman year I suffered from depressive episodes every now and then. I pretended I'd be okay. Then, it got to such a point where every day (EVERY FUCKIN' DAY) felt like a nightmare. I felt sick, tired, near tears--and for no reason whatsoever. I had friends, family who cared, academic and extracurricular success, and felt self-fulfilled, yet I still felt this empty pit in my stomach and my head. I would look around at other people and feel like a total zombie, like I had nothing in common with anybody around me, when so clearly I had so many friends. (Depression is indeed a self-perpetuating disease.) I realized that I couldn't do it on my own, so I sought treatment.

The treatment saved my life. Really. I look at life as I used to before the depression, with the same high spirits that I always had and a ready-for-action outlook on life. Random sadness brought me down and perpetuated itself, but I got the help that I need, and I can say that I'm better now, immensely happier and more self-fulfilled, with no more headaches and feelings of emptiness.

Do I have to say it again?!? God damn it, if you even CONSIDER walking over to a bridge, I will find you, and I will kill you myself. Don't go through what I went through. Get the help that you need. Go to Gannett and have an intake, get a referral and a list of providers in the area, and see that provider. Openly tell your friends that you're depressed. If you think that you don't have any friends (which is WRONG!), tell your goddamn fuckin' parents. If you don't know what to do, then comment on this post, and I will offer you advice! You're not alone and will never be! People do love you and care for you! God damn it, I swear if I see you on a bridge, I will...
