These past few days, I haven't been able to to really study or focus on anything at all. I have a pretty specific reason, but I'm afraid to say why since it's really easy to identify who's writing this if I say it. I don't know why I'm so afraid; it's not like I'm going to die, and I normally don't have anxiety problems. I jump at everything now, and I tremble once in a while even when I'm warm. Sometimes in the middle of the night I wake up in a panic and I just stare at the ceiling for the next few hours until I have to get up. Sometimes I don't even remember that this is happening until my stomach drops for some reason, and then I remember why I'm scared. It'll end soon, but I hate the waiting so much, and I really want to just lie in bed and watch TV instead of going to class.
