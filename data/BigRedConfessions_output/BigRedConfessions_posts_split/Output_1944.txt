i am currently doing a summer internship at an ivy league. although this adventure was quite interesting, i mainly applied to this, so we could be closer (distance-wise). we never saw each other and i doubt you even know that I am closer to you. i miss you. i really and truly do. 
wish you the best yet lo mejor fui yo.
