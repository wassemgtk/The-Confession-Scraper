When my mom heard about Robin Williams' death she said "Dying is easy, living is hard." She scoffed at him for taking the easy way out. If only she knew just how closely I sympathized with him. 
I always assumed I got my depression from my mom because of how emotional she is, but after seeing her insensitivity and the look my dad gave her when she said this, I know I was wrong.
