As a black person, it saddens me to see the events unfolding in Baltimore right now.  I understand their frustration with the lack of accountability for police officers and the demand for justice, but damaging property, looting innocent businesses, and attacking others is not the solution.  Such acts are barbaric and do nothing to remedy the situation.  Everyone must realize that this reaction isn't a reflection of an entire race but of an tiny percentage of black people who are acting on their frustration and anger in an entirely misguided and wrong manner.  Do not discredit the black cause for equality due to the actions of these people.
