I agree with you, even when I am a minority.

Why? because lately programs are focusing on "how you look outside" rather than what is actually going on. Based on what you said, I assume you are not well off, as in with money.

I wish programs focused more on income rather than just race, because it honestly makes it unfair to people who are poor and white, you are pretty much at the bottom of the "preference" list.

And to the person who commented, true, but does he need to pay for that? If your parents did something wrong/had privileges, would it be fair for everyone else to deny you opportunities based on that? Or the color of your skin?

We should strive for a more fair world, not one that creates more division.
