Personally, for me, the worst type of failure is the one you can't control. If I was the source of my failure, then I could at least know something could be done. That I had some chance to affect the end result and fix the situation. But if I fail because things aren't just meant to be, I feel like I have lost control of my whole life. And there is no bigger blow to me than losing control.
