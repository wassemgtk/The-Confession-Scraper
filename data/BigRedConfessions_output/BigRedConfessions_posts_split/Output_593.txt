No matter what happens and what I believe in or say, everybody loves me! They know in the end and in their hearts that I am right, so I don't take back anything or apologize for anything!. People love me and I have been very successful because of that. I have now surrounded myself with a select few wealthy and connected friends who share similar interests, now that I graduated and dissociated with people at Cornell, and these people would literally take a bullet for me so that's all that matters. It's this last fact that makes me feel valued.
