I despise people who throw trash into recycle cans. If you are enough of a idiot to not do something as simple as recycling- fine, that is your individual mistake. By throwing trash into recycle cans though, you ruin the entire consignment and waste the effort of people who do actually care about the planet we live on. For god sake, don't be such a dimwit.
