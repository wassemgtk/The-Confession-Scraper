To #6685:

I am sorry you have had those experiences. It is up to you to decide if, when, and how to tell (or not tell) people at Cornell about your girlfriend. You can also be selective about who you tell and not include everyone if you don't think it's in your best interest. I hope you do find some nice friends who are sympathetic to your situation and delighted you have a girlfriend, regardless of how you internally or externally identify. 

In the meantime, I would recommend seeking out resources that may be able to help you with this, such as EARS and/or the LGBT Resource Center.  Even though it may be intimidating opening up about your situation, these people should be able to provide you with support for how to best handle this. If nothing else, you're not the first person at Cornell to have dealt with something like this and I am confident you will succeed â˜†.
