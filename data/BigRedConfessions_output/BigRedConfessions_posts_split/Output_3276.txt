Why can't I be normal? The dark, obsessive thoughts that take over my head leave me feeling numb or in pain. It's become so bad that the thoughts feel weighted. They take my energy so I can't get out of bed, my chest hurts, it's hard to breath. I can't tell my parents because they threatened to make me drop out and send me to an mental institution. 

The intensity is so much worse than it was as a freshmen, and I feel like my professors and classmates are sick of my same old thing. What do I tell them? My best friend told me it was too much for her, and so I lie to others to spare them my burden...maybe because I'm terrified of what they'll say. I continue to lie. On the days where I lay in my bed and stare at the same cracks in my white ceiling thinking about how much of a useless fuck up I am, those days are the same ones I force myself to laugh about with my classmates as I purposely degrade myself and my integrity to keep them from knowing the truth. It's far easier to tell someone you're just lazy than to tell them about the crippling depression and fear that some day you might just do something terrible.
