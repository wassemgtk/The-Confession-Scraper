I really like this guy but the thing is he gets along with a lot of girls.  He is very likeable, and I admit he's kind of flirtatious, but when we are together I just feel so comfortable.  I want him to like me back but I don't know how to express how I feel towards him.  Furthermore, I can't tell if he likes me because of how he acts towards people.  I've gotten the vibe that he does but when I had the opportunity to act or say something I hesitated because I really wasn't sure.  We've known each other for a while but the only time I really see him is when we are with our group of friends.  On one hand, I don't want something like this to ruin our friendship, but on the other, I really like him. I don't know what to do.
