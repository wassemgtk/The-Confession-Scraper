"I finally did it; I created an appointment with CAPS. After two months of deep depression, losing everything, I'm ready to be happy again. It's hard, really. 
From the outside looking in, I look like a sane, happy Cornell student, but in my own mind, I hate myself and everything about me. From others perspectives, I've had a great semester; semi-decent grades, getting to travel quite a bit, enjoying myself.... but to me, it's the opposite. I've been accused of a serious crime that I didn't do, lost everything important in my life, including family, friends, my love, am at a threat of being removed from school, been suspended from social activities, and cry myself to sleep just about every night. 
I guess the moral of the story is that you can't always judge a book by it's cover, and sometimes going for help is the hardest step to take, but also the most beneficial towards recovery. "
