Yesterday, I went to the Diary Bar to get my usual vanilla and chocolate with a marchiano cherry on top. On the way back from the Dairy Bar, the day was perfect. I walked past Art Deco Riley Robb Hall built in the 1950's and saw a 1957 Chevy with a Labrador Retriever sitting in the front. I was listening to my 50's playlist. It could not have been a more perfect day. It reminded me of how great the 1950's were when the chrome was thick. I can't wait to get back home and slow dance with my girlfriend to 50's love songs......when I focus on the simpler times in America I remain happy. Otherwise if I focus on today and the rogue presidency, I get depressed. Going on a 1950's memory lane and looking at nostalgia is my drug-my antidepressant.
