I have a great girlfriend and I love her, I really do. But there's this girl in my class who is amazing...All of her interests, her fun easy-going personality, her ambition, her sense of humor, how chill she is, everything about her is perfect. She's single and we're coming to be really good friends. If I were single, I would ask her out because she is exactly and more than I could ever dream of in a girl. I'm glad we're friends but I sometimes wonder if I'd be happier with her over my girlfriend. My girlfriend lives so far away, can be so immature sometimes because she is in high school still, and for some reason I don't feel that inner spark and excitement I feel with this other girl. I wish I knew how to handle this right. I know I won't ever cheat on my girlfriend, but I'm really interested in my new friend.
