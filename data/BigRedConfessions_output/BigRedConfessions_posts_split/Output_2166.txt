Sex is really enjoyable to me, and also important in my feeling close to someone. Problem is, I'm going out with someone who doesn't seem to have any conception of sex at all. They're really wonderful and sweet, but at times, it's difficult for me. I definitely don't want to force the idea at all, and I'm sure I can keep this up. But it can be difficult and disappointing at times. Baby steps, I guess.
