TO ALUMNI out there! Does it get better? My time at Cornell has been the most stressful and depressing moments of my life. This school constantly tries to tell me that I'm a piece of shit. And I want to commit suicide so hard, but the only thing keeping me going is the possibility that it is going to get better when I leave. Is it?
