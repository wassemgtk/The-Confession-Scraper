Why is there so much judgment when girls have casual sex? Call me thirsty sure, but why is it so wrong? I am clear about my intentions and avoid hurting people. I am not a terrible person. My moral code is pretty decent. That double standard with guys being studs and girls being whores is aggravating. Not only do I feel the judgment from others, but I'm judging myself...just because society tells me that women cannot be sexual creatures in the same way that men can. Wow. My own feminism is surprising to me. Girl power?
