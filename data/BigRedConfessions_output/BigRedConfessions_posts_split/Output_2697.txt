As I sit opening my second bottle of wine, it becomes more clear why my hall mates are starting to look down on me, why I'm 'that kid who drinks too much'.  I had my shit together first semester.  I really did.  I worked hard in classes and got grades I was pleased with.  I avoided the freshman 15 and even got fitter than I was over the summer (as if that even matters).  I have (or I suppose had, who knows at this point) a great group of friends.  It wasn't all sunshine and rainbows, I'll grant you that.  I mean, I failed my first prelim.  I had an ill-advised hook-up or two.  I've gone out and had too much to drink a few (too many) times.  You know, it was first semester freshman year.  But largely, it was all good.

Well, to save anyone the long read, my friend group started to dissolve.  And I even anticipated that, I mean, I knew that first semester kids hang out with their hall mates and then start to branch out during second semester.  I told myself to not get too attached to this group of friends and to force myself to branch out (but of course I didn't because I'm a fool at best).  But when it actually happened, when 'my' group fell apart, it hurt pretty bad.  And so I drank to make it hurt a tad less.  At first it was a sip of wine or a nip of vodka here and there.  But we all know how that ends up.  Soon it was a few shots, which transitioned to getting smashed each evening just to get by.  

Well to no one's surprise, I can't stop now.  I'm either drunk, trying to get there or hungover and rushing to do the bare minimum of work to get by.  When I don't drink, my chest constricts, my hands tremble and my spine itches.  Any sort of anxiety or emotional pain simply doesn't evaporate until I've had a few drinks.  Confidence?  Hah!  Not until at least a few shots in.

And that's why my hall mates now look down on me I suppose.  I hate to be 'O Woe is Me', but it's not amazing to enter the study lounge each day to knowing smiles and the inevitable "Well how was your evening OP?" and not know the answer.  It's not amazing when one of the few people who's still close with you comes up to you and offers to be moral support at the AA meeting you forgot agreeing to go to while you were hammered (though I suppose I'm pretty damn lucky to have someone who'd be willing to do so).  It's not amazing to feel terrified in the morning when you can't remember what you did last night.

It's not amazing.  In fact, it's pretty shitty.
