Cornell has crushed my spirit but K have found the remedy. I went to the Red vs White hockey game and I can honestly say it lifted me out of the funk I've been in. It was a completely new experience and one that I truly enjoyed. Seeing the players glide across the ice so gracefully was really touching for some reason. Not to mention the men's team is hella fine and total life partner material. I look forward to going back again!
