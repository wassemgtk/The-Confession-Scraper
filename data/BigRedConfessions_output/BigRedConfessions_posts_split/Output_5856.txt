If you don't mean it, don't say it. So many people here say things that they just can't keep up with. It's easy to call someone your best friend. It's easy to tell them that you love and care about them. But it is not easy to be there for them when you have your own matters to take care of. It is not easy to actually love and care about them in such place like Cornell where everyday is a struggle to survive. I've been let down by so many people who irresponsibly threw sweet words at me and then turned their backs that I've reached a point where I no longer believe people when they say they actually care about me.
