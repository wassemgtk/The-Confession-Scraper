"One thing I will not miss after I graduate: the noisy neighbor upstairs with the world's loudest bass noise, who never does anything in life other than listen to dubsteps, play video games, and make other loud noises with god-knows-what. Every day from 4pm-4am you go BOOM, BADOOM, BOOM, BOOM, BADOOM, BOMM, BASS, I say FUCK YOUR SUPER BASS! Now go fuck someone else's life for a whole year. I'm chucking my deuces up to you SUCKER >:D

-from a passive-aggressive neighbor who tried talking to you once, but 'sorry' doesn't cut it if you keep doing it, bro!"
