Real Confession - My friend is single and I have a boyfriend that I love. I am extremely jealous of my friend because of how hot she is. I purposely recommend ugly outfits so she would not look as pretty but for some reason she always looks good. I know it should not matter because she is single and I have an incredible boyfriend but it bothers me. We went out and guys were all over her and she turned all of them down nicely and easily like it was normal. She doesn't even know how she pretty she is which makes it worse. I know it makes me a horrible friend to feel this way but I can't help it. She has such an outgoing and infectious personality, which makes her even more desirable. Help... I don't want to feel this way about one of my best friends.
