Who else gets depressed by romantic comedies? These kinds of things never happen, and they perpetuate false notions and even promote highly ill-advised behaviors - like stalking a girl when she's told you she's not interested. On so many levels they are wrong and they bum us out when we see 2 incredibly attractive people have a perfect story. I just think it's ridiculous they exist in our culture.
