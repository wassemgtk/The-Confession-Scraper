I'm having a very hard time here. I have no idea who I am or what I want to do. I have lots of personal and mental problems that make it hard for me to socialize and make friends. I only have three or four friends and then a few very minor acquaintances and I don't feel very close to or fulfilled by them. I don't feel like I'm a good friend and I don't know how to become one either. I have no self esteem or motivation, I'm falling behind and I don't know how much longer I can continue on like this. I tried to talk to CAPS but I don't know how to explain my situation and it feels a little narcissistic to just pay someone to listen to me talk about myself(although, logically, I know its not narcissistic to seek help). I feel like I should be able to fix this by myself.
