you led me on for 4 months. you used me when you were alone at your old school and for sexual purposes. you told me you liked me and that you wanted to be with me. but you broke my heart and said you wanted to be "just friends". and now you act like everything is perfectly fine. this is exactly why nobody likes you, for how cruel you are.
