Overhearing a conversation from some of my classmates (two happen to be on the student assembly) about the food insecurity on this campus was very disheartening. One person claimed that no such thing exists on this campus and that the idea of a student-run grocery store was absurd. Just because you don't experience an issue does not make it any less of an issue.
