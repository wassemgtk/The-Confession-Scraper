I was the only one in my friend group to go farther than an hour away for college. But I'm starting to notice that my friends are not replying to my messages any more and are talking to me in a different tone than before even though I try to keep in touch. It still really hurts to watch the rest of them stay friends without me even if growing apart is natural.
