Sorry that I didn't stop to talk to you today. I saw the look of disappointment on your face and I feel bad. But, you've been playing hot and cold games for way too long. I don't see why I should continue being nice and friendly to you when you have no problems with giving me the cold shoulder for no reason. You're not the only guy out there and ain't nobody got time for these games.
