Found out that my sister likely has schizophrenia. To me, she was always the quiet, sweet, shy girl. I was basically her only friend, I feel like I failed her. There's a girl here who reminds me so much of her. She sits alone and looks like she could use a friend. I've randomly chatted with her a few times(she probably thinks I'm crazy, oops). But after every interaction, I'm fighting tears.
