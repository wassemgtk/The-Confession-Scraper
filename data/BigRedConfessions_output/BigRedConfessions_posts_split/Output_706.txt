I am an alumnus that is sick and tired of my job in the city. Cornell didn't give me shit. I paid full price for the school and had to earn everything on my own. Whenever I come home I pour myself a few Peechka Vodka shots or Jack Daniel's Mint Juleps and listen to Cyndi Lauper, Rod Stewart, The Cure, Madonna, Thompson Twins, The Police, Billy Joel, and Sting. I miss the 1980's when my favorite President was running the country and the stock market and economy was doing great.  I had a way better job than I have today. In the late 2000's the company I used to work for closed and I got a shitty job before I retire. In the 80's businesses and the middle class expanded rapidly. I had money to drive a nice Mustang, sport a nice Coach leather briefcase that was made in the USA unlike today's imported crap, dress in Brooks Brothers suits, sport coats, ties, and dress shirts that were Made in NYC, and own a nice house in the suburbs along with a vacation home in Florida. I miss my old lifestyle. I hope one day it can come true again and I will be off really well driving a Corvette at 90mph and swerving the curves on the Palisades Parkway, this time listening to Madonna on full blast again.
