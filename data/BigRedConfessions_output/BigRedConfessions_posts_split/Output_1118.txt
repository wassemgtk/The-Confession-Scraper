Anyone else feel like a lot of people get unhealthy cults of personality built around them? this term originally originated (redundant a bit I know) from Chairman Mao but it's happened to a bunch of people, and I think it's really disgusting.

Gabe Bellevue Newell (Steam)
Steve Jobs (Apple)
Bernie Sanders (Congress)

And public opinion almost always sways in their favor so they can do really scummy things and get away with it because of this cult of personality. I really wish people would start seeing past their rose colored goggles.

TL;DR: I'm hating on Valve's poor customer service
