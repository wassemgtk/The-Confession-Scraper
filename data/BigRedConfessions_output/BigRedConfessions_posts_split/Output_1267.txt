I always felt like your “backup plan”.  I knew we were just friends but I was always willing to drop my plans to be there when you needed someone to study, get dinner, or even just hang out with. I thought I was okay with that. I was wrong. All the plans we made that didn’t happen, the times when I wouldn’t hear from you for days, and the unanswered messages have finally taken an emotional toll on me. I do care. Probably too much. I think I need a break from you, from us, from wondering if we would ever be something more. I’m sorry if I seem a little cold lately. Its hard for me too, but I think its my way of forcing myself to finally move on. Its probably something I should have done a long time ago. Maybe then will I stop being anyone’s backup plan.
