I only applied to this school to humor my parents who really wanted me to apply to an Ivy. I didn't think I had any chance in getting in. Turns out, I got in, while 4 other far more deserving kids from my high school got rejected. To this day, I have no idea what the admissions office could have possibly seen in me.
