I'm in a frat, but I'm starting to question the morality of them. I know that mine is OKAY and that some others are OKAY, but in a general sense they just add to a shitty campus culture where students are segregated by class, race, looks... It breeds superiority and inferiority complexes, promotes an unhealthy view on human relationships- social, romantic, and professional, and it overall just has a lot of people acting like pricks. Guys go into it to get laid and binge drink, and girls go along with it primarily due to a lot of free stuff (alcohol, food), and the superiority complex ("I got invited to a formal/wine tour/whatever? I'm so much more attractive than those girls that didn't!")
