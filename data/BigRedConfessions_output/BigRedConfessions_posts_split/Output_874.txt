Today I found out that this guy has been deceiving me that he has a girlfriend. I feel so sorry for her and I wish that I could offer her any type of help or comfort. I haven't felt truly angry in years and today I was shaking with anger. Guys, if you decided to enter into a relationship, keep the commitment and do not hurt the people you love.
