I like how other top tier schools consider themselves on par with the ivies, desperately want to be included in the ivy league, but vehemently deny this fact to show that they are special. Cornell is in the ivy league and is the largest ivy with the most diverse range of studies. *puts on sunglasses;    deal with it.
