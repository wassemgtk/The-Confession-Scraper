I can't believe the year is done. There are so many emotions in that for me. I'm going to miss my boyfriend.  I'm going to miss my ex more than I currently do. My friends are going back to their homes all around the world. I'm not ready for the year to end and next year absolutely terrifies me, even though intellectually I know that it will be great. And most of this I keep bottled up because I'm uncomfortable letting it out. And it's eating away at me.
