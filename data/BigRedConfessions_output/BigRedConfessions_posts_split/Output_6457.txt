To the chick from #1471:

It's not as easy as just googling how to orgasm for all girls. I know a lot of girls, me included, who want to orgasm really badly but haven't been able to and have tried to figure out what the fuck is wrong with us or what we're doing wrong. Chicks who have say its amazing or life changing and that makes us crave it more. We know we're missing something. Faking or moaning to make it sound better than it is during sex sucks ass. It's frustrating to want something really badly and not be able to have that for yourself and to please your partner. Just, from girl to girl, be considerate of us "kids." We're not there yet.
