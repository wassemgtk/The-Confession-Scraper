My boyfriend doesn't understand me sometimes. Not only that, but he makes me feel so stupid for saying it; like it doesn't make sense to him so it doesn't make sense at all, and I'm just being dumb. I hate you sometimes for it. Sometimes I wonder how long I can put up with it and if it's even worth it.
