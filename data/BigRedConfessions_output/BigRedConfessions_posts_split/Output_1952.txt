I miss you Cornell! I learned (and suffered) so much both in and out of your classrooms, but I have no regrets. The most crucial thing I learned at this place was the power of endurance and maintaining a sense of humor: All you have to do is survive and laugh at all this bullshit till things eventually get better.
To all the assholes and friends who helped me and/or made me stronger along the way, I tip my hat to you crazy bastards. Truly there will never be a motley crew quite like you.
