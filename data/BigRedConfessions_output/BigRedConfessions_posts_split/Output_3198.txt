You write for the Cornell Daily Sun.

With my sophisticated vocabulary I managed a 6th grade explanation about how much I enjoy reading your work and how I love your "beautiful inspirations".

Well, that's true. Well, it's much more than true. 

Not only do I love your words, but I'm in love with every aspect of your character. 

Your relentless pursuit for the advocacy of others, your desire for goodness as the norm and your hope for a better life for everybody... You are my dream woman. 

Not to mention your soft, perky voice and curly hair flaunt your beauty so humbly. 

Well if not in this world, a magical world perhaps, how can I ever be with a woman as beautiful as you?

 In what world can we fall in love and make Cornell, or life, worth living to its fullest?
