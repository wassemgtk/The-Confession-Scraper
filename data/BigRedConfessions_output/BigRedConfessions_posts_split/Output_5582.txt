I wish people would smile at strangers more often on this campus! If I notice someone looking at me, I always smile. More often than not, the person will not return a smile but will continue with a blank stare! It's so easy to smile, and why were you looking at me for a few seconds in the first place if you didn't want to be friendly!  It doesn't cost a thing. If people were responsive, I would smile and say "hi" to everyone. Maybe that's just my Californian culture though...
