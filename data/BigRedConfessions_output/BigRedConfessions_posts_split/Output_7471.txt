"I'm studying in the library at 4 AM. This asian couple hasn't shut the fuck up since I've got here and I just want to take their books and chuck them out the window and watch  them roll down the slope. That would be real satisfying. Or yelling at them and saying ""SHUT THE FUCK UP YOURE IN A FUCKING LIBRARY. That would also do the trick. I love embarrassing people like that. 
But I will be civilized and not do that. Please if you're in a library, zip your mouth and respect those who are trying to study around you. Go talk somewhere else.
