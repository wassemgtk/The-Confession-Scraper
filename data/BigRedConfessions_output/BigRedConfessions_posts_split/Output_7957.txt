I want you back. I always will. If you want it, say it, and it will happen. I know that if I get one chance it would be the only chance I'll need. I feel like I can move on if I need to, but I would rather fight to get back the best thing to ever happen to me and make sure that I do it right. I'm not going to f*ck up again.
I'm forever addicted."
