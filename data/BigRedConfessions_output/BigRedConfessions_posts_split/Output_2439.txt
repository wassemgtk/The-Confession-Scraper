STUDENTS IN THE DORMS HAVE TO LEARN THE WORD """"""""""RESPECT""""""""""

So here I am to complain about my floormates. I have all my pans and pots in cabinets (as mostly everyone does) and I don't really mind people using my pans as long as they put it back as it was and CLEAN. However, I don't see this. It turns out that people use my pans and LEAVE IT IN THE SINK FOR TWO STRAIGHT DAYS. Not only that; my soap was inside one of the pans and the person uses it and LEAVES IT OUTSIDE. so let's say I don't have soap anymore.

Anyway, I am just tired of people not respecting others' belongings. IF YOU USE PEOPLE'S STUFF, PUT IT BACK AS IT WAS.

MOST IMPORTANTLY, DONT EAT PEOPLE'S FOOD. You don't know the sacrifice people make to get their food as Cornell is very expensive and many students can barely afford it. There is a reason why we cook; WE WANT TO SAVE MONEY OR MAYBE WE CANT AFFORD DINING OUTSIDE. So, please don't eat people's food because you don't know if they rely on them for the following days.

OK IM DONE.
