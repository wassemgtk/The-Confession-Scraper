I cannot wait until the summer after graduate from Cornell. Imma buy myself a new Chevy pickup truck or a Jeep Wrangler and I can drive down beautiful Pennsylvania country roads without worrying about school work for the first time, listening to Toby Keith's Should've Been a Cowboy or Made in America. I will go up to the Poconos with my girlfriend and we can have a bonfire and drink a couple of beers. I can't wait until I get home to start my vegetable field, ride my tractor, and go to the range and chill down by plincking at a few cans and targets each week with my AR or my Marlin '22. Oh, the country life I have missed all winter is coming soon again. Just have to get through 2 more weeks. B|
