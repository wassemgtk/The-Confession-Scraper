I'm too young to be this cynical about life but I can't help it. I don't believe in love or anything. I mean my mother has had two failed marriages and its hard for me to want a relationship after seeing what she's been through. It doesn't seem worth it. I'm committed to the grind right now. But the thing is I don't know if that is enough. Working hard, going to the best schools, getting the best internships is hard work and it takes a lot out of you. I just don't know if it's worth it. I'm not some genius like my family likes to think I am. I have to work hard because a majority of the kids here are smarter than me. And sometimes its not enough. I had a rough start at Cornell. My first semester gpa was a 2.6 in engineering. I worked through that. Countless late nights reading and doing practice problems. Staying in on the weekends and studying. I'm a senior now and I've brought my gpa up quite a bit but not where I want it to be. My personal standards are high and I fall short almost every time. I've applied to over 60 jobs and have had only a few interviews. Maybe I'm entitled. But is wanting reward for hard work being entitled? I don't know. I also have never had a close friend because I find it hard to trust people. So, I don't think I expect much out of my life. Definitely cynical.
