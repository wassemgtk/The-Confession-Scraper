Life doesn't come easy for anyone, I know that. I like to think I embrace happiness when it happens in my life, and I like to think I usually try to alleviate painful situations. But just right now I feel so alone and gosh sobbing is so much worse than crying! I don't mean this in a self-pitying or pity-partying way, I really do mean to complain that sobbing makes me feel physical discomfort because I can't catch my breath! I'm grateful and aware that I'm just sad right now though, and it's not like I'm depressed or anything. We all get sad. I am sad tonight. I was sad yesterday. "Fake" the happy till you make it works sometimes, and I think I will be doing that however much I can. :)
