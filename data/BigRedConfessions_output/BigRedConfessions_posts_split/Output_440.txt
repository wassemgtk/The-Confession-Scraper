This was me last semester and trust me, make a step while you can! I am in love with my best friend, and thought he was too for a while. Now he got back together with his ex-girlfriend and does not behave the same way around me. He never looks me in the eyes anymore and I think this is because he knows what will happen if he does. I am not sure whether he got back together with her because she dumped him and he wanted her back so much… so now that he got the chance he is not willing to let her go or whether because he truly loves her. The amount of mixed signals he is giving me is terrifying and I can’t move on.
