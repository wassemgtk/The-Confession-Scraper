Response to #5600:

I thought that it was possible this could be about me, and so I figured I'd respond because it's true, I don't know to respond to your text messages or apologies. Look, you're a great guy and we had a really interesting conversation before I left for break - but you asking me whether I was going on the bus alone, pressuring me for more personal information, asking questions that I really did not feel comfortable AT ALL answering. All this the day after I met you, when we had one conversation over dinner. You asked me for my phone number because my phone was out on the table; I couldn't be rude and NOT give you my number, so I did but I felt very uncomfortable doing so.

Your constant, personal questions honestly freaked me out and I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings by not responding, but I don't think it was fair of you to ask me those questions or to expect me to provide personal information immediately after I met you. I still don't know how to respond because while I do want to tell you 'Please stop texting me, you're making me incredibly uncomfortable and I don't like this situation', I didn't want to hurt your feelings. I hope this clarifies things...I know that your intentions are good because you want to be friends, but I'm very uncomfortable and would rather not text you back & re-open that conversation.
