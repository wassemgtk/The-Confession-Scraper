Premed can be such a struggle when you messed up your first semester here and have to drag your GPA back up like a boulder over your head that's just waiting for you to mess up.

I'm not even disadvantaged in any way: I'm one of the "ideal minority" and whatever garbage it's called when you're a brown dude, I'm middle class, and I have the most wonderful parents anyone could ask for. I just got depressed beyond my control first semester and even though I'm much better now it's so damn frustrating that not only do med school application processes see a mention of depression as a "sign of weakness", but that also I have no room for mistakes anymore.

It feels like so many premeds just had the sense for what to do from the moment they entered and I'm just struggling to bear this stupid load that's been on my back since day 1 here.
