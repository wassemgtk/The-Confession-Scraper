To the 23-year old virgins who posted here -- I'm a 31-year old grad student and I was among your ranks until last year! It's really not a big deal at your age, but get it done sooner than later because it starts to get exponentially more difficult to deal with, and you will be missing out on a crucial part of your fleeting youth. Having gone through my 20s as a virgin, I can tell you it's not fun. It's much easier to develop insecurities, it's easier to feel unwanted, your personality suffers in a lot of ways, and your motivation does too as a result. You may start to feel frustrated, grumpy and negative, and your brain will try to fight that psychologically, which will be disruptive to your normal functioning and it will mess with your academic, professional, and social priorities. It will have strong ripple effects throughout every aspect of your life. As human beings, we are naturally wired to take this very seriously -- whether you want to reproduce or not, or whatever your neocortex-placed attitude toward that aspect of life is -- the instinct is encoded into your DNA at a fundamental level as a basic need, and if you don't act on it, it will weigh very heavily on you. Looking back, I honestly wish I'd done it as a teenager. I wouldn't have had a lot of the problems I had in my 20s if I had. It's as important as having a social life and getting a good education, etc. And the relationship aspect of it is just as important as the physical, even if it's not a serious relationship. So start dating, make it a project, do not neglect a critical part of life. You're only young for a tiny fraction of what is already a very short lifespan.
