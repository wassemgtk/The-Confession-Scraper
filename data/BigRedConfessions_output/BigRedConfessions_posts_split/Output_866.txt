Freshman year I was rejected by a girl who I considered my best friend at the time. Me being so insecure, that really hit a nerve. After that I vowed to myself to never put myself out there like that again. The less you care about people the less it hurts later. I never let anyone near me. Three years later and I can honestly say that outside of my immediate family no one knows me well. And I like it that way. People tell me I don't work on relationships and blah, blah, blah. They don't know that I do it on purpose. I don't open myself up so they don't open themselves up. That way we both don't care about each other and there is no chance of getting hurt. I don't blame her at all. When I see her around campus, we never acknowledge each others existence and it bothers me a bit because its so awkward. But it means we don't have to talk and shit and that's good. I know. I don't handle rejection well.
