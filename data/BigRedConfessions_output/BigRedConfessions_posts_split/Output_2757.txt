I'm depressed, to the point of being suicidal. And as usual, I have no one to talk to. 

You're probably thinking 'Oh, s/he can talk to me!' Or 'EARS is a great resource.' But you don't get it. I can't talk to a stranger about my problems, because - and I'm the first to admit this - they are so petty. And that doesn't help me at all. The very fact that this mass of problems that drags me down and depresses me at every turn is so petty just makes me miserable.

I can't talk to my friends and family about it. I'm tired of faux support that leads to exasperation. I've made an effort to reach out, and have been shunned at every turn. No one wants to hang around a depressive.

So I put on a mask. A mask that shows to the world I'm happy and laid-back. But I really can't take it anymore.

It would be running away from my problems, but really, isn't that easier? I'm so tired. Tired of my inadequacy. Tired of my pathetic nature. Tired of trying and failing to change myself.
