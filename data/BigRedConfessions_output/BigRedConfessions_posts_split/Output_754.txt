I feel like the past three years have been cursed for me. I almost lost both my parents, my grades went spiraling downwards, and my financial situation is laughable. It's been only two days of 2016, but I've already picked a fight with my mom and sister, binge eaten a box of chocolates, skipped my evening prayers, and forgotten most of what I studied for an exam that I'm taking in few weeks. This is the worst start to a new year that I've ever had in my life, and I fear that this will just be another miserable year, perhaps even worse than last year.
