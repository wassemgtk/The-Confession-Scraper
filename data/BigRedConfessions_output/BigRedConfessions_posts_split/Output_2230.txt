I know I'm incredibly intelligent, beautiful, and blessed with amazing relationships that enrich my life. And for all this, I'm incredibly grateful. Yet I feel like if I told anyone about my dark reality, they'd leave me. My dad died at a time where I hadn't been allowed to speak to him for the past year and a half. I live everyday with the guilt of letting him die without telling him I love him, all while questioning if he loved me. 
My mom has been broken ever since, and treats everything I do with jealousy, actively sabotaging my plans and giving no support. I like to tell myself she' changed since my dad died, but maybe she's always been like this. I hate to think I give her pain from her own immaturity, and I hate to feel sad for myself that neither my dad or mom can be a role model. 
I don't know if my deep insecurity and belief that no one could ever love me stems from my self hatred, parental neglect, or reality; but, it's a tough reality to live with everyday. I feel ungrateful for all I have, but I feel so doubtful and unloved. You have no idea how lucky you are to have someone to rely on, a back up plan. I have none. No one who would help me when something goes wrong or family to complain to, even. Oh, and probably substantially contributed to the fact I'm in love with an emotionally detached, fucked up  boy who I can't muster up the courage to talk to anyway.
On the other hand, shout out to my amazing Cornell fam who spends breaks with me and helps me when my own family won't, even if I can't tell you my secrets. It's not your fault.
