It irritates me to no end how much the Western world's value of free speech has been eroded in today's stifling politically-correct atmosphere. If we can't be honest with ourselves and work to assess the intrinsic worth of certain ideas or cultures that may be detrimental to our development as a society, why pretend that we are in any way better than the insular theocracies and dictatorships that have hindered human growth both in the past and today? America, the UK, France, and many other so-called "bastions of free speech" have failed to live up to the freedoms that were so hard-won by the blood of martyrs and political heroes. We no longer uphold progressive values when we cannot speak without fear of being silenced or cowed into submission by ad hominems including, but not limited to the following: racist, insert-vocal-minority-group-phobe, bigot, heartless cretin, etc. If any group claiming to represent certain ideological systems or subcultures feels it has been spited by the actions of a privileged majority, the key to addressing these issues is not by militant and verbose criticism of those in power. The only viable solution in a society that has progressed to the point of allowing an equal political platform to voice their grievances is through thoughtful debate and discussion. Any minority group that seeks to accomplish anything through other means ultimately betrays itself. Non-violent resistance may have been appropriate in an age when this was not possible. But to say that this is the only venue today? It is probable then that the ideas and values that that minority group espouses would probably not hold water in a proper debate setting. 
       Universities and governments have already progressed, and are still progressing, enough to protect equality--at least nominally--in the legal world. But the more and more it encroaches upon our fundamental rights as human beings, the further and further it treads into the realm of the absurd. Save for a few brave souls who publish satire and editorials without fear, much of western media has already bent to the will of particular groups over others. When the state and bureaucratic systems begin to coddle one group over another by nurturing a so-called minority's pride over the rights and freedoms of other groups, it is, I think, appropriate to deem it a symptom of cultural regression. 

Feel free to disagree if you wish by committing fallacies of logical reasoning and claiming you uphold liberal values, but I think if context were stripped from the recent events that have occurred on university campuses and the media in the past few years, and people were to analyze each situation through unbiased eyes, they would note that western society as a whole has moved from the constrained and restrictive atmosphere of the 1940's and '50's to a setting of hypocritical and unbridled chaos in which it is deemed liberal and positive in certain instances to speak out against bad ideas, but racist, phobic, or bigoted to speak out against others. 

Ideas and personages are not deemed infallible by virtue of their being members or by-products of minorities. It may be ill-tempered, in bad taste, and inappropriate to publish certain cartoons, or send certain letters or e-mails, or tweet certain things. But criticism, however satirical, however offensive should not even be discouraged. If your group--whether religious or cultural--is truly grounded in the incontrovertible truth or holds the higher moral ground, then logic will prevail and open our eyes to reality. Societies only progress when this messy, uncomfortable, but free exchange of ideas takes place in a public setting. That remains true for France, for the UK, for Yale, and a plethora of other places that should allow intellectual discourse, but are unfortunately being silenced by those who wish to apply free speech to themselves, but not to others. 

P.S. I know C. Confessions is a platform for sexually frustrated, anxious, and stressed out students. I don't mean to take away from your problems, fellow students. But I hope to catch the eyes of a few of you who have not yet mulled this over. Also, I am a pretty reserved individual in real life and don't get the chance to talk about this often and this really bothers me.
