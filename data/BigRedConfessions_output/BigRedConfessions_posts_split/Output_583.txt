I don't know but as a Cornell ECE major I get a high when I hear the buzz of a transformer humming, when I hear a solid state rectifier shaking vigorously as it converts AC to DC for the massive amounts of subway trains running during rush hour, or when a massive rotary converter spins. I just think about the Megawatts of electricity being generated at the power plants that burn coal, natural gas, or undergo nuclear fission reactions in Pennsylvania or West Virginia. I love when electrons flow through the copper from Pennsylvania and West Virginia and fucking create a torque on a motor shaft. I hate solar and wind because it does not create an intermittent source of electrons following through the copper or aluminum wires. I also love going to the Hoover Dam and hearing the roar of the massive generators. That's another great intermittent source of power created when our country was great. I probably confused most non-engineers here, but hey it's us engineers who run the world unlike say environmental scientists?
