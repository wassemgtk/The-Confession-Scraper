Is being single really *that* scary for people who've been in a relationship for a long time? You're willing to put up with that much perpetual unhappiness, next to someone you have waning interest in, because the thought of being alone seems so much worse? Just a heads up to everyone in a shitty relationship they're too afraid to get out of: this boogeyman you call "single life" is not real. You'll eventually learn to sleep without a nightlight and without a space-filler of a significant other next to you in bed. Keep that space open for the person you're meant to be with. Until then, grow some balls, end a bad relationship and learn to be okay on your own!
