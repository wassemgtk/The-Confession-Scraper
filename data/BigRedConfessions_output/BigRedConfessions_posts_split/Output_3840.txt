Stop giving me mixed signals. U should know by now how I feel about you. I can feel that you feel something for me too. I've seen it in your eyes when we are alone, walking past each other without anyone else to worry about. Im tired of waiting for you to give me a sign. Half the time is almost gone. We just have another 6 months more. Send me a msg on FB, talk to me when you see me alone, just do something to tell me if you like me or not. Im going crazy waiting for you. I try to keep distance thinking its just me who wants us to get close but whenever I see you, all my big plans of trying to get over you go down the drain. I just can't control how I feel about you. So please stop driving me crazy. Im not a fresh out of college 22 yr old. I know what I want and what I am getting into. So be a man and tell me whats on your mind.
