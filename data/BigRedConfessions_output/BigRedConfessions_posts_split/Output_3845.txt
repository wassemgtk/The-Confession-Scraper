"I wasn't sure if we were becoming a thing or just hooking up in your eyes. You were giving me such mixed signals.
I knew I wasn't just hooking up which is why I was taking things slow. But then you didn't even wish me a happy thanksgiving. That may seem so trivial but to me it represents your feelings about me. All along you've been putting in less effort than you should have. I'm not clingy or overly needy but those 2 words would have made all the difference. Clearly I'm a here and now girl to you which is strange because I've never given any indication I was a girl comfortable with casual hooking up. I thought there were feelings involved for both of us, but now it's over. I'm
done with being unappreciated and on this holiday of appreciation you showed me exactly how little you appreciate me. I'm disappointed because I really thought we connected but now my heart is free to find someone who cares about me and not just reenacting the porn he watches. "
