I don't care anymore. Your actions spoke louder than your words. I shouldn't have to tell you when I'm upset, I don't hide it. You should care enough to recognize it instead of ignoring it. But thats what you do isn't it, something happens, and instead of facing it, you avoid it or try to make a joke out of it. So I'm going to follow your lead and not care. Your going to need me, and I'm going to do what you do, say I will be there, and at the last possible second, when you feel that relief for all the emotions you are feeling is almost there, I will tell you I can't be there,and I hope you realize how badly you messed up.
