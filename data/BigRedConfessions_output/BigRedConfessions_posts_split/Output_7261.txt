All I want is to ace a prelim.  I want to prove to everyone that I'm smarter than my testing shows.  I guess maybe I care too much about what everyone else thinks, but everyone's judgmental and would probably rather work with people getting As and not Ds.  I just really, really, want to this, and I try and can't get there.
