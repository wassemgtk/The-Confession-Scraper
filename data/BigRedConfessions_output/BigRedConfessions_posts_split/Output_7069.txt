I woke up this morning and every single inch of my body, every part of my mind, all of me, was saying no to life. I literally could not make myself move - even after a decent amount of sleep. I don't know why I'm this exhausted anymore. I have assignments past overdue, missed lectures piling up. I'm not even taking the average number of credits. What is wrong with me?

I've been on antidepressants and in counseling for a while, but why is nothing changing? Why don't I even want it to, anymore?

Maybe I don't belong here.

That would be devastating, though, since this is the only place I ever could call home.
