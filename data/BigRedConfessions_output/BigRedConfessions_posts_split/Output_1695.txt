You have so many preconceptions about me that itâ€™s funny. You know nothing about me yet act so understanding and informed; you don't know so many things. I do enjoy your company and understand my place in your life that I won't butt in where I don't belong. I could say everything you say about me back to you and it would still make sense. I don't act enlightened, but keep an open mind with scrutiny; the image of me in your mind had only been tainted by your own thoughts.
