Similar to finding meaning in a meaningless world, I struggled with understanding the purpose of life. The conclusion I arrived at changed my life, and I hope it can help anyone who reads this.

I started with the thought that there is no inherent purpose to life. At first this seemed disappointing. What can I do? Then I realized this is liberating. I can choose my purpose to be whatever I want. I am not restricted to follow some set path. I am able to choose my own purpose, and I can change it if I want.

One of the most difficult things to do was to change what my purpose was. Long before I had come to my realization, I had a purpose I was dedicated to that wasn't really my own. It was something I strove for as a result of others around me. I chased after it for over 15 years. Letting go was difficult. Even though I knew I did not want to follow my old path any longer, to let go was to leave behind a large part of myself. When I finally took that leap to my current purpose, I set myself free of my doubts and worries that were holding me back.
