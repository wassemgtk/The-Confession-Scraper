In response to the guys actually daring to express feelings in their posts on here: I'm a girl, and I like guys who are genuinely nice or shy or sensitive or really down to earth. I wish you wouldn't be so hesitant to show that side of you -- if you were to ask me out, you could bet I'd say yes in a heartbeat.
