I still don't understand Filthy/Gorgeous. A community all about diversity, inclusiveness, promoting cultural awareness, preventing hate, spreading love, and the best theme we can think of is being lewd and indecent? I understand if certain people feel they would rather be sexually liberal or free. That's fine. Do you. But why are we promoting a complete lack of morals or social decency as the norm? There are hundreds if not thousands of LGBTQIA+ activists that are trying to show the world that this community is not a just group of sexually rampant, scantily clad, misfits, and I feel like you're not respecting that.  I have a feeling if we stopped focusing on sex and started celebrating the our unity as an oppressed minority, we would be a lot better off. The goal should be to prove that we are just like everyone else and deserve equal respect like everyone else. Events like this aren't helping.
