After waiting 18 years and surviving my first year of college, I got a boyfriend. He is the Shaggy to my Velma. The bong to my pipe. The food to my munchies. Although this is my first relationship, I'm taking a huge leap by having long distance relationship. My mom thinks I shouldn't be tied down, because she thinks sophomore year I'll find someone else. It worries me a lot....I really like my boyfriend :(
