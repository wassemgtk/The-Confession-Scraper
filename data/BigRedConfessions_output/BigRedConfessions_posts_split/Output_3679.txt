I'm in love with her. She doesn't even know I exist. She has been in 4 of my classes and everytime she speaks it's incredible. When I see her walking around campus it makes my day. I saw you at my fraternity's party last weekend but you were with your friends. You looked beautiful. The moment you took off your coat no one could not stop staring at you and you just shyly walked to a corner with your friends. All I wanted to do was talk to you, say hello, but he hovered over you like you were his. Even when you slipped away from him for those few minutes i couldn't talk to you because people were constantly flocking around you. I saw you turn down 3 guys just walking through a short hall. Why would you ever even speak to me? Why him? He didn't deserve you that night. All I can do is be in love with you and never be able to say a word about it
