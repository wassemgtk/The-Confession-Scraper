You youngsters don't know what it means to have grown up during hard times. All you do is complain how hard Cornell is and how much work you have or how society is giving you a hard time. Try growing up during the Depression like my parents did, raised us, World War II happened, and then we had to cut back on basic necessities to support the American troops and war material movements. I then attended school at Cornell, served in the Korean War and returned back to finish my education. That was the real deal folks. My parents and I grew up during the worst of times and made it through believing in faith and that God would help us through. We sure made it and grew up knowing not to take things for granted and how to have respect. We don't go pose selfishly for pictures in front of everything and we don't complain about everything like many of you youngsters do. We did not go waste our parent's money on coffee from expensive chains like many of you do and complain about inequality. We worked our butts of to get where we are. I don't know what depression even is because the hard times made me who I am today and that is a very strong individual like my parents were. My children and grandchildren were raised right and grew up to appreciate things and not complain about everything. They still do not spend money on bullshit and take selfish pictures.  They also know how to respectfully talk to others and not spend their lives looking down at their phones.
