I fucking hate myself as a biology major. I barely get any opportunities in career fair, who the fuck wants a biology major? I'm just a "pre-med", whatever the fuck that means. And being a "pre-med" doesn't get me a job at all. It just means I'm giving up all other potential opportunities today for this one fucking occupation I don't even know if I can one day succeed to pursue.
