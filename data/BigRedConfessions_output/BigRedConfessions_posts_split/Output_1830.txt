I'm increasingly frustrated with the anti-science, anti-intellect, pro-freedom-of-Christianity-but-not-other-religions, pro things-that-don't-make-sense (e.g. lack of any and all gun control) stance that so many people in this country insist of taking. And of the impacts that all of these things have on politics here. It honestly makes me want to leave America, and I probably will if I can.
