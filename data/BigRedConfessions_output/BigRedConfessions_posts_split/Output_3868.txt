I feel incapable of deciding what to think about the events in Ferguson. I've heard all about the evidence, and the only thing I'm getting out of it is a sense of debilitating confusion. There is conflicting evidence and missing evidence galore: why were Brown's clothes never turned in to be used as evidence? What happened to the DNA test on the gun? Why is every witness report totally different? People ask me for my opinion, and the only answer I can give is that the case was decided on no evidence at all. In so many ways, it reminds me of the Pistorius case: one of the witnesses is the perpetrator, and the investigators made such a mess of things that we're left with nothing. It's two-sided: you need to take a leap of faith no matter what side you're defending. And yet people seem so sure of what happened. Fox News runs headlines such as "Officer's Story Indicates That Brown's Actions Led To His Death" while other headlines ask "Why Does Everyone Believe The Lies of A Racist Cop Who Has So Much To Lose?". And while the media and my friends pretend there's only one way to see the issue, I stand here refusing to take a side. Because I can't support or condemn without an understanding of what happened. And if I can't, then I don't know how a court could.
