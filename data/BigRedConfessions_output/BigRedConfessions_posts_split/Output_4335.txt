I really wish I had gotten into Princeton. I spend at least a half hour every day thinking about what I could have done differently to have gotten in. At first, I thought I was crazy for doing this, but I've come to realize that it's completely rational. Cornell is cold, in the middle-of-nowhere, and filled with douchebags, alcoholics, and sycophants. Throw in the indignity of being seen as a safety school, awful housing, and crippling bureaucracy, and well, it's just a miserable place. I'm abroad this semester and can't stand the thought of returning. Like Jesus Christ, I'd even settle for UChicago or Northwestern.
