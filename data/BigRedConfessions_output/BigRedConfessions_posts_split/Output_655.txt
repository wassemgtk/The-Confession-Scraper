I have the song Highway to the Danger Zone playing in my head all the time when I walk around campus waiting until school starts up again. I came a bit early and I am bored. The song plays on repeat and reminds me of my favorite movie Top Gun, which was very patriotic during a time when our Navy and military was the strongest in the world under my favorite President, Ronald Reagan. :) I hope we can become just as or even stronger soon so the world will look upon us as a leader of democracy.
