You want to hear a real confession? Here's something I haven't told a soul, but as of late I feel the need to tell someone or I'll end up blurting it out to someone who could damage me with it. Let's see. Some time ago, I had a girlfriend, a nice girl who never meant any harm, with a kind heart. She was rather taken with me, even though I wasn't all that interested in relationships at the time, but she was nice and wanted me to be her boyfriend. The time we spent together was wonderful, going to date nights and formals (yes, frat boys do have hearts, contrary to popular belief) and sharing our inside jokes. She laughed at my attempts at humor, which was good enough for me. She was pretty, funny, the complete package, completely undeserving of a wretched, selfish bastard like myself (I like to think I've improved, but who am I to judge). The year was drawing to a close, and we were having as good a time as ever, or so she perceived. I was on the brink. Total self destruction, the call of the void, whatever you call it. I was preparing to kill myself. No, I wasn't having trouble with school or friends, I was just depressed. Have been my entire life. Family history, lonely childhood, all that jazz. I saw this girl that was so full of life, so undeserving of a boyfriend who would abandon her like this. I knew I had to break it off before the summer began, to protect her, to buffer her from myself, and I left. I couldn't bring myself to tell her, lest she try and stop me. At the time, I needed the escape and couldn't let anyone stand in my way. So, I got drunk, smashed, wasted, shitfaced drunk and broke up with her, trying to convince her that I was a jerk who didn't deserve her. I was certainly convincing enough. We broke up, and I almost succeeded in my attempt a few weeks later, but it just ended in a prolonged stay in a psych ward. I'm not any better now than I was in that regard, just accepting of who I am and my urges. I just wish I could tell her, so that she could call off her sorority sisters who scorn me at every chance they get as the guy who hurt their sister for seemingly no reason. I'm sorry. I'm sorry for what I did. I thought it was the best at the time. I wish I could tell you. I'm glad you've found you're new beau. You seem quite happy with him. And that's really all that truly matters. Happiness. Everyone deserves it.
