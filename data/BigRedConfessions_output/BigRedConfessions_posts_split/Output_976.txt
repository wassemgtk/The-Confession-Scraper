I know what its like to be invisible. My friends wouldn't notice if I disappear. They might when I don't work on the group project but besides that I don't think they would notice. Its ok though. I don't think I will keep in touch after I graduate. It feels weird to not have friends. I'm not one to go to bars or parties. I'm not one to introduce myself to random people. It just feels like I'll never find someone. This makes me weak. I hate weaknesses. I hate myself for feeling this way. I just want to graduate, get a job, and get an awesome dog. I'm ready to leave this place.
