"There are a handful of PSP students who cut the line in the Becker dining hall. Everyone else makes an effort to wait in the line and these students clearly see how long it takes for someone to get his/her turn. Please do not act without shame and pretend that you are not cognizant of the long line behind you. It is very infuriating because these students act like they don't give a f*ck.
