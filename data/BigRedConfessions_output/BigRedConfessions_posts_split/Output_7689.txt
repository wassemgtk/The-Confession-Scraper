I'm the last person you'd think feels alone. You see my smile, you hear my laugh. I seem to be surrounded by many. But the truth is, I am always alone. I've tried, I honestly have, to meet others and spend time with them, but it always ends the same way: I end up lonely. I haven't cried about it since last year, but the sadness courses through me regularly. That big smile on my face is to hide my loneliness.
