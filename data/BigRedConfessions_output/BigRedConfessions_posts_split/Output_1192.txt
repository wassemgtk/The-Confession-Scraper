I wish I never broke up with you.  I said I wanted to see other girls but I was wrong. I only want you. You will never take me back though and it is all over anyway.  I wish I wasn't such an idiot. I wanted to spend the rest of my life with you. Maybe I can find happiness at the bottom of a bottle...
