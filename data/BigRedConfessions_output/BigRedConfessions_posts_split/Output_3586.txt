Just realized my best friend is extremely condescending and uses me for what I offer to her. Shit. I wish I never asked what was wrong, so I never found out. Now I need to slowly untwine her from my life so she doesn't notice until years pass and we haven't spoken. All this effort. Why couldn't you just care?
