Roughly speaking, I've been single for my entire life at Cornell. There are plenty of people that think I'm fun, or attractive, and plenty of people who I think are fun, or attractive. The only problem is that finding the intersection of all 4 of those is nigh on impossible. Usually it takes me up until the last month or two of school to meet somebody like that, and then the time difference over the summer screws up any chance at something longer term.
