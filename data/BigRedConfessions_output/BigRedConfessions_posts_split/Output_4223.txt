I really like this girl and want to ask her out. But I'm drowning in depression. She's so sweet and happy and energetic all the time. I don't want to drag her down. I feel guilty just thinking about being with her. I keep telling myself I'll go for her once I've found my footing, but I'm scared by then it'll be too late.
