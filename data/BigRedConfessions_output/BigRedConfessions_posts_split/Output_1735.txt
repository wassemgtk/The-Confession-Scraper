Lately I've been feeling very lonely after coming here.

5 years ago, I was miraculously saved in a car accident but I observed my girlfriend dying on the very spot. False rumor spread that I abused her, and I had to transfer. The other friend in that car died 2 yrs after the crash after being in vegetative state, and another friend of mine who I trusted the most died of leukemia. What's worse is that so many people not believe this when I gather a tremendous amount of courage to speak about it. Now, I am scared to date girls even though I like them because I am afraid that I will lose them like I did before and also that I feel guilty of liking someone else.  I have always lived like a clown with a fake mask, trying to be goofy and weird to cover up the sadness.
Now that I am here, it feels even worse as most of my friends are back in south, and I have a hard time making new friends ever since I was framed. The girl I like back in my hometown doesn't even reply back to me. I would have committed suicide long ago if it wasn't the tremendous expectations my family had in me, but I feel so lonely and sometimes I want to cry.
