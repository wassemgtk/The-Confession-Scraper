I want to show you that I care about, respect and admire you so much. How much you mean to me and what effect your mere presence has on me. But I don’t know whether if this lack of action will speak louder than any of my words. You asked for it and—as someone who wants to give you the world—I will deliver, even if it conflicts with wanting to be there for you. I miss you, and—acting contrary to my normal course of action—this bridge will always be here, stable and always readily available, just waiting for you to cross. Hopefully one day you can forgive my selfish acts and do so.
