Imo kids these days are weak and super coddled! To paraphrase Alan Dershowitz "They want complete freedom over their sex lives, over their personal lives, over the use of drugs, but they want mommy and daddy, dean, and president to please give them a safe place, to protect them from ideas that maybe are insensitive."

We got to realize that we live in a bubble when we're in college, no one in the real world cares if you're overly sensitive or can't take criticism ..all that matters is if you're a good employee ...
