I wish we lived in a world where you could just walk up to random people and say - hey, I don't know you, but you seem like someone I could fall in love with. Is there a chance of this ever happening? And then they'd look at you and say - sure, let's try it. Or - no, you're not my type. People would save so much time and heartbreak and everyone would be happy and people would be flattered when it happened. But alas, we have the social contract... So we have all chosen to be unhappy, for the sake of being civil. Game theory...
