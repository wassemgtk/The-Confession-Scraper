"Wow. A lot of the dudes posting on here are either pretty decent trolls or just true dickheads. I can't believe some of these things are the thoughts going on in people's minds here. Jesus, dudes. Stop taking your problems with rejection from a few women out on the entire gender. It's really just sad. Just move on. Like, you're seriously giving up on half the population on Earth because a small handful of women, at most, have turned you down. You're in college. You are going to meet so many more people in your life. We all get lonely and want companionship but ""getting some pussy?"" is not the way to solve it (I'm looking at you #2279). Stop treating women like objects and maybe things will turn out better for you. They are just as complex of individuals as you are. They have their own shit going on and you might not fit into that. If they aren't interested in you, don't fucking fault them, and in some cases, appreciate that they were nice enough to try to spare your feelings. On the flipside, ladies, sometimes you do need to be more straightforward with your intentions. No one wins in these games we all play. 

TL;DR- Everyone stop being assholes to eachother
