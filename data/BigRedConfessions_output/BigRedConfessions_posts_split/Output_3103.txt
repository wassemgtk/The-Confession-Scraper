My friends are so boring. I love them and stuff, but sometimes I feel like I made the wrong decisions in being friends with them. It's our senior year, and all they want to do is sit at home and watch movies on Saturday night. It's annoying, like let's actually go out and have fun. I don't want to graduate and regret that I didn't have enough fun as an undergrad, but they're making it difficult.
