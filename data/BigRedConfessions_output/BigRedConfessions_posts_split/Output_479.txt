Life is a constant back and forth of not being good enough and knowing we're all worth it. There are days I think I'm crazy and days I know I'm not. I'm okay with it all. What hurts me about it, though, is that this is the struggle we all face, yet you wouldn't let me help you when you needed it. At the end it was easier to push me away, tell me it was my problems that were too much, and lie to me about wanting to stay involved in my life than tell me your own struggles and let me help you. It was easier to choose those around you who tell you what you want to hear than listen to the one person who tells you what you need to hear. So much for going to the moon and back. It's just a cliche anyway I guess.
