It's so tempting to just give up on my dreams and get a consulting job, so that my mother can stop holding her money over my head.  Today she told me that I will probably have to pay significantly more money (read: 6 figures) back to her than we previously agreed on, for paying for my education here, and questioned if I was even invested in helping my brother go to college, since he should be able to go to whatever college he wants to just as I did. I understand that, and I love my brother, but I am just sick of her always holding money over me, and now I'm afraid due to this I'm never going to be able to escape her.
