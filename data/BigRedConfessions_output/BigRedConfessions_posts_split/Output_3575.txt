I'm working for my friend's Dad over winter break. Over the first week, I just realized he has an unreasonable and explosive temper. He constantly yells and belittles everyone around him, but no one stands up to him because he's the boss and they're afraid of being yelled at and being publicly shamed. Ugh. The worst part is that I can't avoid him after work because I'm living with him and his son. I can't wait to be out of here. For now, I'm avoiding any interaction with him as much as possible for the next 2 weeks. I can't wait to be out of here.
