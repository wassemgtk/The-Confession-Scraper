So many of my qualified high school friends wanted to come to Cornell so bad and got rejected, so it's really difficult for me to see how some of my friends waste this incredible privilege we have.  How dare you not go to any classes and go out every night and never do your work when there are so many people who would kill to be in your position? Are you that irresponsible and uncaring? Check your privilege!!
