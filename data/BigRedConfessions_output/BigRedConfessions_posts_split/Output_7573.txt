I found an old email I had drunkenly sent myself a long time ago when I found things on your phone, a list of the things I needed to remember; naked skype requests to others, asking the girl you cheated on me with "why you only did it once", a list of four girls names who you had been sexting to, reconnecting with your ex, and telling her you were "sorta with someone."  WE HAD BEEN TOGETHER 2ish YEARS AT THAT POINT!  You were the fucking worst, I can't believe I put up with all of that shit for so long.  I'm glad I'm getting to the part of the breakup stage where I'm not sad, I'm just fucking mad.  At you, but at myself for thinking you were the best I could do and for forgiving you the first time.  You were a piece of shit, and I know you know it.  Fuck you.
