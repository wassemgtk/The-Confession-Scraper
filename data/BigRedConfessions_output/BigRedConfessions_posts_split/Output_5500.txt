Last year I was sexually assaulted.

I was at a party with friends, and a boy started dancing behind me.  I was put off by how he somehow materialized behind me and started grinding without a word from me, but he knew my friends and I didn’t want to make a fuss.  A few minutes later, he turned me around, grabbing my head and my neck while he forced his face into mine.  I felt violated, helpless, and at the same time disgusted with myself for letting it happen. I left the party immediately and had to shower for over an hour before I could calm down enough to tell my friends why I had left. It took months before I was able to go out again socially, let alone drink in group settings.

When I told my friends about how traumatic it was, they dismissed me, saying he was an awkward kid and he was drunk, and that it was a misunderstanding. But still, I couldn’t even walk into Libe Cafe because in the months after, every time I went near, I’d see him there with a smug look on his face, staring at a library-issued laptop as if he prowled the library just so that I couldn’t.

I know my experience with sexual assault pales in comparison to many of the horror stories I’ve heard, and knowing how much my experience affected me negatively, I can’t even begin to imagine how traumatic it must be for women who have had worse things done to them.  You can laugh and joke all you want about the gratuitous usage of the term “rape culture” but don’t deny its existence.  And when you reminisce on all the wonderful times as an undergrad, know that others aren’t so lucky, and that one incident can poison 
an entire experience.
