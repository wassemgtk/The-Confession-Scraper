I had a really fun time at a formal with this guy, thought we really hit it off, and we wound up hooking up... haven't heard from him since...I wish I could take a situation for what it is, a great night, a moment in time. But I'm not like that. If I walk into something having no expectations, knowing nothing beyond this instance can transpire, my reasoning is what's the point in going through with it? I wanted you to at least talk to me. I wasn't expecting to jump into anything serious given we're leaving soon--but I guess I wanted to know that the reason you even asked me was because you were interested/somewhat liked me. I'm an eternally disappointed fool and wish I was a girl guys felt lucky to have and scared to lose verses being treated like the dog poop on the bottom of their shoes. I guess if I learn anything at Cornell it'll be to stop expecting anything. There's no disputing that there's good guys here, but as for the rest, half of them are too scared to try anything real and the other half have convinced themselves they don't want anything real.
