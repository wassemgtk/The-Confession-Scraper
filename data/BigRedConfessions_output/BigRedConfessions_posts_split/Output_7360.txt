It is quite ironic seeing Latinos accusing Latin Americans of "cultural appropriation." At least they were born and raised in the culture, rather than became "all for it" in college. If you have the guts to do that, just think that you are doing the same considering that you are american and that if you go there you will be culturally "an american." Embrace your Latino culture but dont tell others how to celebrate and experience the Latin American culture.
