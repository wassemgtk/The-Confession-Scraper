I just tried to study in a conference room in a science building, asked if it was OK for me to study there. Three Asians just stared at me and said absolutely nothing.

As an Asian American, I can see why the rest of you would give us negative stereotypes, however, please give us a chance! Not all of us are weird. In fact, a lot of us find the weird behavior just as weird as you do.
