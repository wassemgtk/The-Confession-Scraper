I wish you were ready for marriage, because we'll be out of here soon and I'd sure as hell prefer to go with you than without you. At the same time, it wouldn't be right to pressure you into anything, and that would defeat the purpose of it in the first place. I just wish we were at the same stage in life, because every single other thing about this relationship is perfect. I hope it doesn't kill me to lose that... (literally).
