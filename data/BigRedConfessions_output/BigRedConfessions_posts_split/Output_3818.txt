I didn't realize I really liked this guy until he kissed me. I waited for him to text me but he hasn't contacted me since. It has been over a week. He is so out of my league. I like him a lot in real life, but when I browse his Facebook wall, I lose interest. He openly flirts with everyone! Should I just forget about him?
