I try to express my gratitude in person to but I just wanted to say it in another way, thanks to all the people who are in my life every day.  From the small interactions in class with acquaintances to my best friends here at Cornell to my Family.  You all make my life so great!  You have no idea how each one of your small acts helps me every single day.  Thank you :)
