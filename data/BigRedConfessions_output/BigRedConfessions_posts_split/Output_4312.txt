My parents cut me off the middle of sophomore year due to fractures in our relationships with each other. As a result, I've resorted to male stripping during vacations and weekends while keeping a part-time job during school to make ends meet. After tuition and other expenses are paid for, I barely have enough money to eat. So I mooch off of friends and sneak into Okenshields whenever I can. Sorry for stealing. And for stripping. Ok maybe not stripping. But sorry for stealing.
