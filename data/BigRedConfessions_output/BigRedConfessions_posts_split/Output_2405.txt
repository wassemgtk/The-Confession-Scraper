I am really torn about whether we should break up or not. I really like you and was thinking I loved you before all this went down. I know deep down inside I can do better but it's hard for me to let go. At the same time, I don't want to be stuck in a relationship for an extended period of time where I'm not appreciated. Let's face it  things are not really going to be different At our core we are who we are. There is so much good about you and so many awful things as well. I have really never felt so torn. If I stay I close myself off from someone who could possibly make me much happier. If I break up with you then I might come to regret it especially since I remember how much dating before you came along sucked. Most of the guys I dated were jerks and you are not a jerk, but is that enough to stay? You're not a jerk, you just don't put in any effort.
