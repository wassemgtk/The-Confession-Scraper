Thank you for sitting near me and eating quietly. Few people can. But, at the same time, do you really appreciate a quiet meal alone? Because when I mentioned that you seemed to, you did not welcome me as a fellow soul with this preference. Which is fine. I'm sorry if I ruined your dinner with my candor. I still am grateful for your (perceived) solidarity. 

P.S. I was not in any way trying to flirt with you. I think people often mistake my efforts to love and be kind to all people, especially the ones who bring me quiet joy with their humanness, as demonstrated romantic interest.
