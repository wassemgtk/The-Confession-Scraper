I'm in love with two different women. One is my girlfriend. We have been together forever and we know everything about each other. I can think things and she can know it without me having to say anything. I'm always comfortable around her and we love each other deeply. Spending time together is always fun. That's not to mention that we have been through everything together. Our life together would be amazing; I know it.

The other women is a close friend. We spend time together, work on classes, and generally have fun. But there are times where I can see myself with her as part of a couple. I can see myself getting to know her better and it seems like an entirely new adventure. It is really difficult to just be friends and the attraction is definitely there.

Can someone plzzz help me? I really don't know what I should do and I am driving myself crazy.
