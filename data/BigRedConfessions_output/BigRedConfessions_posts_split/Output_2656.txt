I'm not sure why, but after coming back from this Spring Break I feel incredibly homesick, almost to the point of tears sometimes. I've never felt this strongly about wanting to be back home, not even during my first days as a Freshman, but now the month's wait until summer almost feels unbearable.  I'm not sure if it's from all the work I have to deal with from the Sophomore Slump or the weather, but as soon as I stepped onto campus I felt overwhelmed with the desire to be with my family again.
