I'm a mechanical engineer major who probably should have been a physics major. My secret for getting through p-set after p-set of beams bending and shafts getting twisted is to put on daft punk and pretend I'm a robot. Problem is, sometimes it carries over to regular life. I was just wondering if other engineering majors are stereotypically awkward like me because they're pretending to be robots to get through drudgery?
