Knowing how horny I get, if most men get the same amount of horny on a regular basis, it's really amazing there isn't more rape. I'm not defending men in any way here, but when you think about it, rape is almost natural and it's a testament to human will to form a civilized society that we've minimized it as much as we have. It can always be less of course, but knowing how many stupid idiots walk around, the fact they can restrain themselves to a considerable degree is kind of amazing. Women really have no idea the kind of horniness that we experience every waking hour, and I bet most men hate it as much as I do. I wish it didn't happen, it would save me a lot of frustration. Thank goodness for masturbation, we would have NEVER gotten out of the caves if it didn't exist. Life finds a way...
