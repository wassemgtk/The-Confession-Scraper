This term, I've started doing something - i guess it would be considered self harm-  again. I am terrified to go home because my parents might notice. I've gotten it over control, but there are still signs. I have to go get a physical (with my pediatrician) and I'm 98% sure she will notice. I'm legally an adult, so I know she should tell my parents, but I'm afraid she will. I'm hoping i can go by myself, in which case, i think i can talk to my doctor and explain. but if my mom comes with (which is more than likely) I'm screwed. I'm afraid she will try to make me leave cornell. or act really awkward around me. My parents are very un-emotional. I know they love me, but they don't know how to express their feelings or talk about anything. so they just watch me. constantly. which only makes everything worse. I'm more stress about the prospect of going home then finals. i actually hoping the plane crashes or something. I don't know what to do.
