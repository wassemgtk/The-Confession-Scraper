Mistletoe? Seriously mistletoe is considered "offensive" at Cornell and we can't dress our dorm rooms in that? WTF. I will dress my room and invite people to my clandestine Christmas parties all I want. It seems like I am living in the former Soviet Union having to hide my religious beliefs for fear of prosecution. If students get offended they can kiss my ass. I'm serious how can an adult student get offended by decorations? It just doesn't make sense. If you don't like it don't look at it. This is liberalism at its finest and I cannot believe I am living in this world. If only I could go back to the days when my grandparents went to Cornell. Cornell was decorated with stars, wreaths, and Christmas trees and nobody was offended.
