I blew a good handful of chances with girls freshman year simply because of my own low self-esteem. Off the top of my head, I can think of at least 5 occasions in which I failed to do anything about girls who were, in retrospect, clearly into me. Four years of high school loserdom had simply left me unable to fathom the idea that sentient human females could be attracted to me. Ah well, live and learn I suppose.
