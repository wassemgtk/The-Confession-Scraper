I know I shouldn't be so upset but it frustrates me to be a virgin. Like I don't even know how to kiss. This is a problem. I am an 18 year old girl. I feel like all do is get high with my best friends and people I barely know but I can't even muster up the courage to speak to a guy other than to ask about homework or to be courteous and say "hi". I try to dress nice, be nice, look nice, but I don't even get a second look, ugh, am I that ugly? By the end of 2014 I want to at least make out with a guy...I don't think I am ready for sex yet.
