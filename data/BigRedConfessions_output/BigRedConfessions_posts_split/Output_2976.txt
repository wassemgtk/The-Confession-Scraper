I really, really love Cornell. So much that I not only did my undergrad here, but also grad school. I'm worried and nervous to be leaving soon. Life outside Cornell will suck :/ But I will never forget the experiences I have had, the people I met, and the fun I had learning at this gorgeous place. 8| 8| 8| 8| 8|  <3 🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻 🐮🐮🐮🐮🐮🐮🐮🐮🐮🐮
