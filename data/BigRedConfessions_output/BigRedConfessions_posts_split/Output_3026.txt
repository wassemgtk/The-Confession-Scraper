Whenever I try to start my homework, I think to myself, why should I?

To get it out of the way to practice my hobbies? I don't have any.

To get a good grade in the class? Why should I care?

To get a good job? To make money? That's all worthless to me. The only thing I want to do in my life is matter to as many people as possible. I'm not even sure if I like my major, let alone the jobs that I could get out of it. At this rate, I doubt I'll get a job where I'll matter to anyone.

I don't know what I'm doing here at Cornell. I don't think I've gotten much out of it so far, and it has only given me deep-rooted mental problems.
