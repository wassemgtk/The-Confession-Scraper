Please! Please do not sit on the toilet and occupy the stall for 10 minutes when other people have to use it. I understand that you want to look up stuff on your phone in those few minutes of relaxation between classes. But I beg you, please be quicker because other people have to go and your decision to fb stalk your ex during that time has a very negative impact. So please, try to minimize your time in the stall when possible and when other people need to go. Thank you.
