I need different friends. I mean, I don't even want to go to Slope Day because I know they're probably going to spend the entire time shitfaced. I know I'm just going to be standing around awkwardly because I don't drink. It's just not my idea of fun, but it seems like that's all anyone at Cornell and at college in general does. 
Please, people who don't drink, can we start some sort of club? I hate spending all of these weekends alone. I want to have fun. :( 
So...help?
