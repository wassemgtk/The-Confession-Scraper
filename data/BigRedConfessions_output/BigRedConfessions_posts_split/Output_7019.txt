i've got 99 problems and prelims are NOT what I care to talk about. When people ask me "how are your prelims?" instead of "how're you?" I literally just want to walk away from from the conversation. I am more than happy to help you destress during prelims, study for them with you, or listen to you get angry about them, but for christ's sake if they're the first thing you talk about in a convo, then it doesn't seem like you actually care about our relationship.
