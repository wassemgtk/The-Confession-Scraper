Everytime I poop, I think about how happy the bacteria at the Ithaca wastewater treatment plant will be once the shit reaches the aeration tanks. The bacteria will have fun gobbling up all the organics in my wastewater, including the stress hormones that wash off my body when I shower, and I will be contributing to their growth.  💩💩💩💩💩💩💩😎
