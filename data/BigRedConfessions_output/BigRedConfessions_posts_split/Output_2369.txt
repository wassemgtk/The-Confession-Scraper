So tired of hearing terrible shit in regards to gay people and the use of the term gay to cast someone or something in a negative light. Obviously, this term has become cultural lingo, so for the time being it doesn’t upset me too much. What is upsetting however, is hearing guys talk about how gay other guys are and how “omg he was acting so gay and saying the gayest shit, thank god he didn’t win the rap battle” 

Fuck you I’ll be as gay as I want because that’s normal
