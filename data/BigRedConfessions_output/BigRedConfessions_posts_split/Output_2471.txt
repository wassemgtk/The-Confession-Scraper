I'm not happy at this place, even though I receive good grades and get great internships. I always think an important point of attending a top school is to realize you are not the best person in world, and to learn to be humble and work harder. Apparently some Cornellians on this campus don't think so. They appear to be conceited, as if they are the greatest people, have everything they want, and are capable of doing anything. They appear to be privileged and deserve it so much. I'm sorry but I have to say they are truly disgusting, native, high school-minded. I'm disappointed that I have to go to school and live with these childish people, which bothers me so much. I can't wait to get out of here in one year.
