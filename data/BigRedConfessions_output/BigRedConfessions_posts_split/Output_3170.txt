This February month, I had the surprise of learning a significant chunk of my "silent" friends are actually dating. I even got to know a few are engaged and planning to get married after graduation. Me? Still single. With only a few months away from graduating, I start to get worried about being forever single. Tried dating but the ladies left me in a limbo state of "yes" and "no".
