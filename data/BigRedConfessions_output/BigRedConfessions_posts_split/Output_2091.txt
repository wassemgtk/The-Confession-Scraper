I was born in China, but came to the US at a very young age. It's holidays like Memorial Day that make me question whether or not I want to change my citizenship (I am still technically Chinese). I would like to think of myself as an American, but how can I celebrate American troops who once raped the women of my birth country and those of other East Asian countries, in the name of freedom? Places keep playing the "I'm proud to be an A-meri-can" song today, and I can't say I would be so proud of America's past.
