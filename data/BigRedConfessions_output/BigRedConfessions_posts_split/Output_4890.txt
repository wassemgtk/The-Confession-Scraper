"EVERYTHING I WRITE SUCKS AND MAKES ME SOUND LIKE A STUPID TEENAGER GIRL WHOSE EVERY ATTEMPT TO LIVE A LIFE FULL OF LOVE HAS FAILED

WHAT IS MY PURPOSE IN LIFE? DO I HAVE A PURPOSE? WILL I LEAVE A MARK ON THIS SHITTY WORLD OR JUST BE ANOTHER NAMELESS FACE? AHHHH 

I literally cried in front of strangers on the train yesterday thinking about all this... Can my life not be a revival of ""Waiting for Godot?"" Thanks.
