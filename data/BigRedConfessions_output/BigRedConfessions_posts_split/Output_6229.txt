"I'm crushing on a guy with a long term girlfriend. I know there's so many guys out there, but it's still hard to swallow. I've been in this position before and I'm not about to do it again. It's completely unfair to everyone and there's so many guys in the world that there's no reason to mess with someone else's relationship. I wish them happiness; they are adorable together and for myself, I hope I meet someone like you- someone's who's as intelligent, talented, athletic, amazing, and witty. I just want to be the steak and not the mashed potatoes or corn. That girl better know how lucky she is :)
For now, I have Ben, Jerry, and Mr. Doritos to keep my company. "
