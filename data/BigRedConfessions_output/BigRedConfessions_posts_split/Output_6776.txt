"honest question: why don't more guys ask girls on actual dates in college?
one guy, since I've been here this year has asked me on an actual date to go out to dinner.
Some have asked me to get lunch/dinner at a dining hall or to a formal which is slightly better but the majority have just wanted to ""hang out""/""watch some tv""
The thing is I don't want to hang out with you if that's your euphemism for hooking up. I would never use a guy to just buy me dinner; I always offer to pay my half because I do feel bad and I don't want to take advantage especially if I'm not actually sure I like them back. But asking me out is about effort. It's about showing that you're not just using me/that you're interested in knowing me. I do not judge anyone who just hooks up without dating; hell, sometimes I feel like just hooking up but it's not something I'm comfortable with (at least not yet).
I guess this is a plea to guys to please ask girls on actual dates. I get you're a broke college student but it doesn't have to be anything special/expensive. I just want to know that you know there's more to me than just being any other girl/any other body. Let me know you're interested in me as a person and you won't be disappointed. Besides the fact, if you ask most girls on campus on an actual date the smart ones won't rejected you because it shows rare breeding. "
