I feel like such a failure sometimes. I feel like everyone around me is so accomplished and doing well in their classes and doing amazing things with their lives already. Meanwhile, I'm just here. I'm involved in several groups on campus and I have a job. I just feel like I've done nothing compared to some of the people here, and no matter how hard I try, I'm just stuck.
