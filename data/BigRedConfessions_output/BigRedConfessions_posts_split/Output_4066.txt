If you saw me walk past you, you wouldn't bat an eye. I'm your stereotypical frat guy: white, buff, vineyard vines, pastels, all of that. But I have a bit of a secret. I think with almost no question that I am sexually attracted to men. I don't know why. Whenever I meet a guy that I have a spark with, I get butterflies in my stomach and just want him to be mine. Whenever I meet a guy with gorgeous eyes or an incredible body, I'm just speechless and want him so badly. But from the position I'm in, the most we could ever be are best friends and to be honest, thats what I wished was all I wanted from him. But I want something more. I have a bit of a problem. I've known for quite a while that homosexuality was a part of my identity but I have always imagined myself with a woman. I've always wanted that picture perfect family. I don't know what it is but I just love how a heterosexual couple looks. There seems to be a such a balance, an elegant dance between aggression and docility. It just looks right to me. I want that so badly. It's not like I'm completely unattracted to women, I've had sex with many girls before and enjoyed my experience for the most part. But there just isn't that spark I feel with a guy. I don't have butterflies in my stomach even when I talk to a gorgeous girl. When I meet a girl I have a great connection with I just want to friend zone the fuck out of her. I want to be her best friend but nothing more. Yet I don't want to be in a gay relationship in the long run. I don't want to be homosexual relationship and have to live a life of continuous discrimination. When I see a homosexual couple, I just see two guys holding hands, not a couple. Of course I'm sure there is an incredible love and bond between them, but I just don't see myself in their position. I want to be straight and live a straight life so much, yet I can't help but be attracted to men. I'm just so attracted to masculinity and strength. Ive spoken with a very select number of people about this and they've told me that I needed to really figure out if I am attracted to men by hooking up with a guy so I've downloaded Grinder. But I just can't bring myself to show my identity because of how much shit I'll probably get from my brothers and because I don't want to be gay. I want to live the life of a "normal" (gay people are of course normal but you know what I mean) straight guy. I don't know what to do. I have this fantasy that this is just a phase and just a "college thing" but i know the chances of that being true are next to none. At the same time, I don't want to live in denial my entire life and live my life with a woman I'm not attracted to. I wouldn't want to do that to her nor myself. But I just can't get myself to accept homosexuality. I just can't. I don't want a gay relationship. I wish I could just have a consistent fwb where we can both take care of our needs yet live "straight" lifestyles in every other aspects. What do I do? Where do I go from here?
