I am in a frat even though I cannot really afford it. When I joined, it was all colors and beauty and I liked all of the brothers and enjoyed doing all the activities I did with them as a pledge. It was good for me because I literally had no friends to hang out with so they were there whenever I needed them. However, after I started paying dues, roughly $3k a semester, I got a taste of what they really do with the money we pay and I feel I'm not really getting my money back worth of stuff. 

I have been just in a bad mood lately because of that. I didn't enjoy my summer at all, saved every penny I earned and used some of my financial aid to pay for the dues and I have been working a lot of hours per week during the semester to pay for rent and other bills. I don't know what to do. I am not happy in it. If I was getting my money worth of something for me, I'd not be complaining about it but it's hard to pay that amount of money just for a couple of beers every other weekend and hangout with my brothers.

I don't want to quit because then I'd be alone and have 20+ guys and people around them hating me for that but I really cannot afford it without working so much and saving every penny I earn. Like, I don't go out with other friends, or buy clothes or a new pair of shoes that I'd need because of that. I know I got myself to this but I don't know what to do either. Don't get me wrong, I have had a good time many times with them but I just don't feel it's worth $6k worth of hard work a year to pay for what it takes to be part of a frat.

I cannot talk to  any of my frat brothers about it because they won't understand me (since they are all rich) and some of them are shitty enough to tell me "why did you join then?". I really don't know what to do.
