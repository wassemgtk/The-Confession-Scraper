I am really tired of people hating on the fact that I believe in God. I shouldn't have to feel like I have to hide my faith because (some) others will judge. Not all of us are crazy, and some of us are really casual about it. 
I'm thankful to be able to at least once a week to be in a place I feel I belong. :)
