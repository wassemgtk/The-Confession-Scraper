I feel really bad that I'm taking a year off from school due to a combination of family issues, severe money problems and the overall feeling I have that I'm not ready to handle Cornell right now. I ended my freshman year with a really, really, REALLY low GPA and I want to stay premed so I'm taking a break. God, this is still so embarrassing. I've never not been able to handle academics in the past. Wish I could return to school like everyone else. :(
