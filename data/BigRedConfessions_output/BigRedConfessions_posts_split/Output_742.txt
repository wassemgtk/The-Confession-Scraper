I met a guy who scares me. He doesn't get the job done. He is frustrated, sexually because he cannot get the girl of his dreams who goes to princeton. I am upset about this and I am asking you guys what to do about this situation. I am truly upset, and honestly I don't know what to do. He is just so frustrated sexually, and it leeches on to me. Help me. Thank you.
