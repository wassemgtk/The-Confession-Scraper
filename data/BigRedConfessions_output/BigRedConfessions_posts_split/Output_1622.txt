I think abortion is in a murky category somewhere between manslaughter and murder because it doesn't kill someone yet it prevents a potential life from being lived...and yet I'm totally okay with it being legal because I don't want pre-beings which are unloved and/or afflicted with painful deformities or disabilities to be forced into this world. I'm afraid to speak my mind because my friends are so polarized by this issue and I'm saddened that, like so many politicized topics these days, I don't think we could have an earnest, intellectual conversation about it without letting our ideologies interfere.
