I graduated and got as job. Now my parents are guilt-tripping me hard for wanting to move out, like "why do you want to leave us, don't you love us?" and similar sentiments. How can they not understand why I would want a place of my own, and not need to have them ok my every action and breathe down my neck for almost every decision I make? It's not like I don't love them, but every time this discussion comes up I'm apparently being selfish. What, do they expect me to live in this same house forever? They're already talking about arranging my marriage in a few years... like, I feel so goddamn stifled.
