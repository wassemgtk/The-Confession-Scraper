To the physics major whose name is pronounced like a form of precipitation,

You are beautiful. I wish I could tell you this in person however society dictates that you don't tell random people that they're beautiful. You are the physical embodiment of Adonis but you probably already know that. Seeing your gorgeous golden hair and slender tall body is enough to take my breath away. Just wanted to let you know that you have a secret admirer.
