Your lies are neither realistic, nor creative. I saw the bite marks, the soiled panties, and noticed you coming home at 4 in the morning smelling like someone dumped a shitload of AXE on your head. You honestly expect me to believe you went to walk the cat?! You were so fucking drunk you didn't even realize cats don't need to be walked! Not to mention, we don't even HAVE a cat!!! You're a bitch. Plain and simple. Enjoy your life alone seeing that sleazeball from New Jersey (yuck!). Oh, and I stole your birth control pills. hahaha...
