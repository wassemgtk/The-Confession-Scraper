I am a computer science major, and I love my major so much that it's almost like a shelter, or comfortable zone, to me in Cornell. This probably means there's something wrong with my general experience as an undergrad on campus. I feel in my CS community, I'm not judged by my race, look, attractiveness, etc. I don't need to worry about not being involved in greek life or anything. I'm not interested in joining a frat at all, but even if I did, I'm kinda sure I wouldn't get anything. I'm free to choose the type of social life I want - SOBER, chill, respective, friendly, inclusive. There have been micro aggressions that happened, but I can tell that faculty and some fellow students around me are definitely paying effort to eliminate bias in the community because they just care about it so much. However, when I'm not in my CS or engineering community, it's a completely different world. I can't agree more with #3649 - everyone here is experiencing a different Cornell. We are divided, and I can't view the whole Cornell as one community at all.
