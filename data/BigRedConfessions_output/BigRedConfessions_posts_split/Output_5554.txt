Dear girls studying at Mann library, I know we all have to relieve ourselves while studying at Mann but please please please try to poop before leaving your dorm or apartment if you can so the toilet doesn't smell of poop all the damn time. And if you absolutely can't, please refrain from pooping in the first stall so the smell of your poop doesn't greet us when we walk into the toilet. And please close the damn stall when you are done!!!! Some of us don't wanna smell your shit (fine, we all shit but really though!)
