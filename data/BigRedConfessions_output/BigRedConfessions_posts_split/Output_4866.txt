I really like K-pop and all, but I feel hella conflicted bc I'm black and it seems like the K-pop industry is constantly appropriating aspects of black culture for "cool points" while disrespecting us at the same time. It's annoying. It's great that you enjoy our music, hairstyles and dances, but why treat us like shit behind it when you're using our culture to gain popularity? Idk if I want to listen to this music anymore. Kinda disgusted.
