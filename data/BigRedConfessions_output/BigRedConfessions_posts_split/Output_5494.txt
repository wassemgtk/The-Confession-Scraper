"The other day when I was walking home, I was called the n-word (I'm not even black) by a car full of white frat boys. Thats not right. People are pretty brave when they think that nothing can touch them and they can easily just drive away. 

Forget being a racist, people like this are cowards because they would never say that word to a black mans face. 

You would get your ass kicked!"
