"I'm nervous about having a pelvic exam at the planned parenthood center. Will it be weird to have a complete stranger down in my business? I have no idea how not to feel embarrassed or self conscious during the process. I haven't even told my closest friends here about why I can't make plans with them. I want to pretend like it will never happen.
