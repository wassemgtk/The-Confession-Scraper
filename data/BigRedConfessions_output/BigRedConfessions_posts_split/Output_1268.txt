I just found out that my boyfriend has been wearing the same underwear for four to five days. When I confronted him about it, he said that all guys don't change everyday and they only change when they shit in their pants. I was at a loss for words. Is this true? Do guys really not change their underwear for days, or weeks at a time? WTF That's so gross! We haven't had sex since I found out. Also, his underwear was originally white. Now it's like a drab...grey. Fuck. WhadooIdooo????
