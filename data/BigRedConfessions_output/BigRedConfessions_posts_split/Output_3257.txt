I used to think that I was average looking, but appreciated for my personality. But lately, I'm starting to think the exact opposite: that I'm just attractive enough to be a token but hated for my personality. I'm not used to having any physical self esteem, but this new insecurity is ten times worse and is preventing me from concentrating on anything.
