The only texts I ever get, are the google verification codes for logging into my email.

On really bad days, i look at see a 1 on my messages. I open it excitedly to see it was just the google code I never bothered to open. Then I delete it. And the messages are empty again. 

Why bother writing these papers or cramming for these finals if before or after I didn't have friends who cared or will care about whatever it is i'll do in my future. 

No amount of material success that cornell can offer me can take eating alone every night and never going out or doing anything with anybody. This place is psychological torture. I would give anything to be stupid, ignorant, happy and content with minimum wage. 

I take a spot here from somebody more emotionally and mentally equipped to handle this place. 

Loneliness is going to kill me.
