To the girl who kept periodically locking eyes with me this evening in Olin: sorry. I wish it wasn't finals week and I had time to spend getting to know you. I had a lot of work and you seemed focused too; I didn't want to interrupt. Or maybe I was completely misreading the situation. That's also possible. Maybe in another life.
