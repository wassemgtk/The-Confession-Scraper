Writing this as I am dosed with all kinds of substance to keep me up through an all-nighter for the prelim 2 hours from now that I stayed up cramming for. I'm scared of how far I'm willing to go, deteriorating my health, my social connections, and most importantly the time of my life for some fractions of GPA that might or might not help me move forward in a career that I might or might not enjoy. This suffering is hell and I'm just willingly diving deeper.
