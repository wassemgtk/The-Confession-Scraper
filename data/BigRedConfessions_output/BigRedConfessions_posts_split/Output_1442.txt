I really love my boyfriend, and want to live in the moment of our relationship, but at the same time I'm terrified. He is quite amazing (not perfect, but amazing), and I am severely flawed. I really want to continue our relationship after we graduate this spring, at least give it a chance, but I'm not sure if he would want to. I'm willing to work for our relationship, but he has to be too. I just wish I know he felt about the situation.
