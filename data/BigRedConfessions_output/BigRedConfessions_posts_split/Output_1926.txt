I freaked out this morning, because I couldn't find one of my balls. I was feeling around for quite a while, but after a diligent investigation I was able to account for both of them. Phew. What a scare. I woke up with pain in the area, so I thought maybe one had deflated or something had happened to it. But no, it was just a good old case of blue balls, due to a date last night that involved a lot of making out without sealing the deal. I will know better than to not masturbate after something like that again.
