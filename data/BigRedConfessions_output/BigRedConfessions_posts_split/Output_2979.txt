I met this girl in one of my classes this semester and I really like her. But  the thing is, I have a girlfriend who I love and want to marry. We're very honest with each other, and I would never cheat on her because the guilt would kill me and probably ruin our relationship. And I love our relationship.

I know the other girl is just a crush, and that I probably only like her because shes new and fun, but I cant stop thinking about her. I cant tell my girlfriend or anyone else my thoughts because I know it would hurt her too much to know I even looked at another girl.

I'm so happy to have found the love of my life, but sometimes I wish I found her a bit later so I'd have time to play the field. And I worry I'm limiting my experiences. The worst thing is I think she likes me too. I almost wish she didn't, but I'm happy she is.

Any advice would be welcome. I have no intention of acting on it but maybe I should.
