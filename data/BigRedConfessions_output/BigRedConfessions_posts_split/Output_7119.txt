To the girl who smiled at me as I passed her in Rockefeller Hall: you made my day. People do not realize how much gestures like this can lighten people's moods. Earlier today, I was standing in front of Fall Creek Gorge contemplating what life may bring to me in the near future, but I no longer have any of these thoughts. Thank you for making me feel useful.
