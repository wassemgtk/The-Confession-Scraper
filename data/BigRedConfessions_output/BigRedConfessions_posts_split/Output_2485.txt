Hey dude! Stop measuring the size of your penis. In my opinion for the same reason that someone should not be ashamed of a micro-penis or a milli-penis (!) a guy should not be proud of his large penis. You can usually be proud of something that YOU have achieved or help to achieve. Something that is about your body and you did not have any choice about it is not YOUR problem. Go and learn some good manners and etiquette and good social behaviors to impress your dream girl.
