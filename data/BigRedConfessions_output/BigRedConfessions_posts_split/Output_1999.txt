The university declined my loan over the summer for 2000 dollars because I'm not taking summer classes and my bursar bill isn't paid because it all went to rent and living expenses last year.  My security deposit for 1300, not including first month's rent, is due by the end of the month and I don't have any way of making money besides whoring myself out. 

I hope that if you read this and you are one of those incredibly lucky people who don't need to worry about money, you don't take it for granted. I see people on campus wearing Canada goose jackets and hunter boots and I need to prostitute myself to make ends meet...and even then, it isn't enough. I really hope you are grateful for what you have, because having enough money to live comfortably isn't a sin, but not appreciating it is.

I wish I could have that luxury.
