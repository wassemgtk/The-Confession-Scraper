"This one is for the ladies:
You see, for years, I've been known as ""the nice guy"". I've also been told several times ""Oh, Anon, you'd make such a great husband!"" AKA I don't want you as my boyfriend though. I've tried and tried, but I've never made it past a first date. Every time, I get the same text: ""You're a great guy, but blahblah excuse blahblah Don't talk to me unless I have a problem"". I'm fucking done. Too long I've put up with this. It's taken it's toll on my psyche. I suffer from depression, paranoia, and bipolar disorder due to failed encounters with girls. I fully expect the comments saying ""Man up"" or ""Maybe you're just boring"", and I understand where y'all are coming from, but I don't care. The girls I've met in my life have ruined me. I put up with them for years, and now I only can see them as objects. You've ruined yourselves for me. I can't see you as human beings anymore, merely things that may have sex with you, but not before fucking with your mind first. So thank you. You've broken me. I'm embracing the change. No more Mr. Nice Guy, to be cliche. My roommate and friends from back home have already noticed the difference. Congratulations ladies, you've continued the vicious circle in creating another asshole guy. 

I don't give a shit anymore. I used to care. I just needed this last hurrah of expressing my feelings before I lock them away for good.
