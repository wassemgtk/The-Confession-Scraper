I have a great internship, loving family, pretty decent grades. Friends who wait for me to get back home. But, I don't seem to care - I can't feel anything. It's like I am in a TV show; as if I am not real. Everything is fake. I am fake. I started drinking; a lot. Get drunk every other day. I started smoking cigarettes. I don't really care if it is killing me. I am not afraid to die - don't care if I die tomorrow in some car accident, hit by a drunk driver - but it is not something I seek either. I just feel very light, and I don't think anything can snap me out of it.
