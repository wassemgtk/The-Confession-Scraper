WHY DOES NO ONE FLUSH IN URIS LIBRARY? Everytime I use the first floor unisex bathrooms, 90% of the times it is not flushed. One time, someone came out the bathroom and our eyes met, and then when I went in, the toilet was not flushed. (I hope you felt a little guilty there...) I just find it so disgusting. Please flush after yourselves everyone!
