"I had a fucking single on west campus in a main house for my sophomore year, but I couldn't take it because I had to leave because of poverty and home issues and I'm still so enraged. I've been out of school for two years now and I just feel like a failure and a bum. I'm still struggling to pay my bill so I can return. If that's not bad enough, I should have been graduating this year, but I took a gap year after high school because, you guessed it, poverty and homelessness. 

I just wanna die. :/ I'm so fucking useless. "
