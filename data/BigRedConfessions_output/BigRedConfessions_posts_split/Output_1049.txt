To all the band freshmen posting about how the BRMB is the best thing ever... band doesn't end in the spring! Join pep band! You'll be glad you did, and it'll eat up all the free time you thought you would have once marching band ended (in a good way!). Plus, it's good to play for teams that win, especially after the last few football seasons...
