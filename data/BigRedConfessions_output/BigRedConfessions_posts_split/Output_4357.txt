"All my friends here are Asian. It's just like how it was growing up, but here they seem to spurn me. Like I get I might not be as smart as them, but why do they have to ask so many good questions in class to make me look bad? And then when I bring up something small that happens to be SLIGHTLY incorrect because I don't know as much as they do, why do they all have to correct me down to the detail?

The other problem is that the Asian girls kind of don't accept me. It's kind of hard being Indian on this campus. The only other Indian people I've met are straight from India, or they're really whitewashed if they're from the States. Life is just too hard >< I give up sigh...

Maybe I should switch to Engineering. There's Indian people there, right? (Except more Asians too)"
