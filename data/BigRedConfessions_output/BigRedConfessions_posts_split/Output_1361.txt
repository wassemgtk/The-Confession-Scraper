I swear to God if I ever have children I will accept and love them unconditionally. I will tell them I love them just the way they are, Mr. Rogers style. Even if they end up being the second Charles Manson I will visit them in prison. I hope for the strength of character to allow them be their true selves and to give them the values and tools to help them get there. I don't feel that it's right to bring another PERSON into this world if you're just going to try to mold them into what is your own ideal and not theirs.  

For the rest of my life, I will likely have to deal with the emotional damage and crippling depression that comes from growing up all my life with parents that never truly loved me or accepted me for who I am but only for what I could be in their minds and my achievements. My parents, my father in particular (I can't call him my dad), pretty much let me down at every point in my life that I needed a role model. Instead, they always put unreasonable standards on me and brother with their words rather than leading us with their actions. They are the epitome of 'Do as I say, not as I do'. 

From little things, such as criticizing me for not being masculine enough, to big things like belittling me for suffering from depression, the consistent message I get from my parents were then and are today, 'We don't really like you for who you are. Why can't you just change to something we can like more?" 

First-generation Asian parents are in general, a truly awful and emotionally abusive group of people and what makes me truly sad is that gathering from what I've heard from others, my parents weren't even that bad in the grand scheme of immigrant parents. But in the end, I have to try to understand. My parents were in turn raised by old-school Asians and unlike me, they didn't have the benefit of being raised in a relatively enlightened country such as the United States to help them see their errors. 

In any case, the cycle ends with me.
