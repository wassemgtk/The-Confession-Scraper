"I've compiled a list of criterion for all future boyfriends of mine. Must be:
Able to get to down to business to defeat the Huns
Tranquil as a forest but on fire within
Swift as the coursing river
With all the force of a great typhoon
With all the strength of a raging fire
Mysterious as the dark side of the moon"
