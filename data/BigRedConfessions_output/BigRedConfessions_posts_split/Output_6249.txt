I had such a great night. I went to wines, then I watched frozen, then I sang along with let it go. You jerks literally couldn't let me have one nice night without you being loud as fuck and keeping me awake when all I wanted was to pass out after a chill night. Fuck you. I hope you get fucked by our landlord. Seriously though, shut the fuck up at midnight on a Monday. Some of us like to sleep.
