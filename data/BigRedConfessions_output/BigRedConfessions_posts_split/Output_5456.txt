I rarely eat in Becker, but when I do, I see this one girl. She's tall and has that strong eyebrow game down pat. She's pretty slender and tall, but whenever I see I'm like "damn my hilarious awkwardness". I'd like to think we exchange glances, but meh. Probs not. Anyways, if you see this, keep doing you! :)
