I hate when people post stuff from upworthy or the huff post. Why? because it is as bad as posting something from fox news. Both are politically bias to the point i want to puke. I am neither conservative nor liberal, but i look at the good and bad things from both sides, however, i keep myself from reading sources that are everything but professional.
