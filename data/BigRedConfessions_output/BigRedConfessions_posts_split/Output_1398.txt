I am so fucking tired of myself. I don't understand why I do what I don't want to do. There doesn't seem to be a point to anything, when all of my energies are focused on keeping myself alive. I hate missing out on people, and living, but it takes such an overwhelming effort to stay mentally sane that I'm exhausted when it comes time to do any sort of real work. 

Its weird to be so dysfunctional, and then see everyone at lecture, and in dining halls, and just walking, obediently taking notes and being normal, good people. I wish I could do those things too, without collapsing when its over, fatigued from the tension inside of me.
