Random but since coming to America about 5 years ago, I think dogs are better treated than minorities. Like you would pay for mani-pedis for your dog but watch minority children grow up in dangerous neighborhoods getting little education and dying from easily curable diseases. Idk maybe it's because I'm a foreigner or an alien or whatever but that seems kinda fucked up to me.
