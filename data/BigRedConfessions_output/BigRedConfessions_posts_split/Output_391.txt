Whenever I am coming home from my job in NYC during rush hour, I think about the massive amounts of electrons that are flowing from Pennsylvania to help keep up the NY state grid as thousands of subway cars and regional trains are sucking electricity from the catenary wires or third rail. Is that weird? I'm glad I graduated from Cornell last semester, since I have more freedom to think about other things that bullshit problem sets.
