I have thought of keeping a distance and tried not to lead you on. But I am so selfish that I keep looking for you when I am lonely. I had a crush on your best friend, but somehow I have become so dependent on you. I never thought that we could become anything but friends. But recently I feel like I enjoy the chemistry between us, even without a committed relationship. I would become jealous when some other girls get close to you. But I am not sure that if I like you. I am not read to commit to a relationship, not to say that I have a crush on someone else. You are a really nice and sweet guy. I care about you so much but I can never become your girlfriend. I should keep some distance from you. But I don't want to lose you as a friend. Can we just stay in this ambiguous relationship? Please do not fall in love with me. I am a really selfish person, and you are too nice for me.
