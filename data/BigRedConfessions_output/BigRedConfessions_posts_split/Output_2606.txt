So I'm pretty sure I was asked out on a date by another guy. I would classify myself as a straight male. I don't know exactly how to tell if it's just him being friendly or wanting a little something more. He asked me to catch up over a coffee or meal, but it's only been a few days since I saw him. It's also possible he might be being extra friendly so he can stay somewhere near NYC for free when he travels. Anybody have any advice on this? There's no real way to avoid him as he works where I always go to eat. He's not in this group so don't think this is about you.
