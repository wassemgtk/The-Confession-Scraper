I'm concerned about one of my best friends who just doesn't seem to care about anything anymore. I don't even know why he hangs around me, because I'm such a pessimistic downer all the time. I know that he'll read this and not know who I am, but I still care about him, and more than anything, I want him to be happy. He's there for me when I need him, even if he's not the best source of comfort at times. He's always willing to talk things out with me, even if he can sometimes be a bit harsh. Listen. I'm not asking you to trust me or talk to me. It's okay if you don't. But please, please, please know this: no matter what happens, you will always be my best friend and I will always care about you, even when we are both gone from this place and each other. You deserve so much more than just being able to live; you deserve to thrive, and to be that really amazing person I know you hide within yourself.
