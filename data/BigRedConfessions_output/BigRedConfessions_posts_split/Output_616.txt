When I were a student at Cornell, men and women had respect for one another. We didn't have rapes  occurring in the late 40's and early 50's and the campus was very peaceful. Men returned home after taking their dates back home to meet curfew and couples did not become intimate until after marriage. I am chagrinned by the lack of respect embodied by the students of the millennial generation. Those were the days. I married my wife right after college and lived a happy life until I lost her a few years ago. I know that one day I will be reunited with her back in God's home. I wish I could go back to these peaceful times under Eisenhower again and enjoy those days again with her though. I am remorseful for the fact that many students will never be able to see the "Happy Days" version of Cornell. I know I will see my wife soon enough and we will enjoy the happy days again, though.
