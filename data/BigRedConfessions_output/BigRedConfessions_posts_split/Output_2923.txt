I'm non-binary and i don't know where i fit in at Cornell. I still go to all the women-related events and stuff because I'm not "out" yet, but it never feels right. I don't know what to do. Is there a safe community for people like me at Cornell? Haven just scares me because it feels so... gay white male. Help?
