"As a sorority woman, one of the most hurtful words I see relating to this part of my life is ""sorostitute."" It demeans thousands of women on this campus and millions in this country. And it's twofold: it at once reduces women to their sexual activity and shames them for perceived promiscuity. ""Slut-shaming"" might have acquired a veneer of clich√© from casual use, but it's still a big fucking issue. (And while I really shouldn't have to, I'll note that it's far from the truth and in general my unaffiliated friends are more promiscuous than my sisters). 

And while the social scene is a big part of what we do (we are, by definition, a social sorority), a sorority is so much more than that. I know this confession is going to get a lot of eye rolls, and maybe some hate in the comments below, but the sisterhood thing is real. I thought it was bullshit before I joined, way up until I started living in the house, but there IS a bond and we would honestly do anything for a girl in need. 

Also philanthropy. Lots of philanthropy.
