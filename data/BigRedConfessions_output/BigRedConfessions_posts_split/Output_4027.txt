I hate myself. You started as a friend, and I was completely oblivious as you were trying to make a move. Then I realized it, and I was scared because I've never been in a relationship before. Your friends asked me if we were a thing, and I said no, even though a part of me really hoped we would be. But I guess they told you because now you won't even talk to me. I'm so sorry, I really wish you would try one more time, because I know now that I do want you. And you have no idea how much I think of you and how much I despise myself for missing my chance.
