Things have become very much going through the motions. Sure there's exciting stuff, but its so infrequent. Every day before I go to sleep i stare at my ceiling and ask myself "what's next?" And each time I try to do something exciting, it peters away back into the sea of dullness. And yet life used to be so happy.
