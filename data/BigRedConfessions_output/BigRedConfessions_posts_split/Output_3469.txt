i thought i could handle it but i cant. my emotions go from an extreme infatuation with you to hating you. whatever it is that i feel at a single moment i cant stop thinking about you. i go anywhere i could possibly see you hoping i catch a glimpse. why do you have to be graduating? i facebook search you and all of your male friends hating every single one of them. sometimes i just hang around in your dining hall hoping you wander in. everything about you excites me. your smile, your beautiful brown eyes, the way you speak and what you speak of, your laugh. i replay every single moment i spent with you in my head, searching for signs of how you feel about me. i cant sleep because of you. everything i do is about you. i talk about you with my roommates so much they know everything about you and never met you once. i knew the day i saw you in my class last semester you were special. i tried getting closer but you never let us spend time together. now youre ruining my life because i cant handle this obsession i have with you. i just hate you. but love you too. the moment i see you my inside burns. youre just a drug to me. i feel like i have no control of myself with you. i get so mad at you, i can hate you so much when we dont speak or when you push me away. but the moment i see you, i just fall a part. i want to be around you always. i dont want anyone else with you except me. i have this burning obsession and it's just swallowing me whole. she's graduating in may and staying in nyc but i dont know what to do. how do i stop this. it cant be healthy
