"this might sound creepy to some, by I'm an addict. an addiction is a disease. What im about to say might sound crazy but just like cancer kills, addictions kill. although addiction make u suffer first, always, and i have suffered. i just want it to end, but it doesn't work like that.     
I am addicted to pornography and masturbation; I have realized I have an unhealthy obsession with women. (dont worry i haven't stalk anyone, but many do). I finally got to a 12 step addiction help program and became sober. I came to Cornell and wanted to make new friends, just friends, girls and guys no differently. I tried hard but I didn't succeed. I did make some friends with girls it seemed at first, but nothing more than friends, and I was happy with that. However to them i wasn't a friend, just an acquaintance, we said hi after class, but never got together, even after sending them multiple texts. 
This became my new addiction, wanting them to answer my text; I would wait night after night and end up with no work done. I broke a week ago, started looking at porn again, and tonight I masturbated for the first time in 10.5 months. Itâ€™s heartbreaking. I just want friends.
