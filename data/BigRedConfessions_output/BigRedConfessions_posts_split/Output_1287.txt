Last week, I was discussing post graduation plans with a close friend and I was incredibly disheartened by his reaction. When I told him that I accepted an offer as an investment banking analyst at a high profile firm (GS/CVP/LAZ/EVR), he proceeded to go on a long rant about how I was destroying the world and how investment banks are "evil." I asked him why and his answer was that banks steal from the public and don't contribute to society - which, clearly, is not what investment banks do.

This attitude is exhibited by a lot of people in the general public, but I didn't expect it from a Cornellian. People need to educate themselves about what they're judging before they formulate their opinions. Nine times out of ten, someone ranting about bankers screwing up society will not be able to tell you why they think that if you ask them why they think that. If you look at the articles about the unfortunate Moelis and Goldman suicides from this past summer, all the comments are uneducated and honestly inhumane insults proclaiming that the individuals "deserved to die" and "the world is better off without them." There's so much undeserved hatred to the industry that I don't even want to tell my relatives about my job even though it's a position that I've had to work extremely hard for and will work extremely hard in - it's something that I should be duly proud about. 

So what do bankers do? They advise companies on mergers and acquisitions by valuing the company they're representing - that's it. Analysts work incredibly hard to do this and spend upwards of a hundred hours a week at work. They have it tough enough without people who don't even understand trashing them so please be courteous and don't bad mouth an industry that you don't comprehend just because the media tells you to do it. 

And if you really have an urge to bash financiers - go shit on the traders.
