Sometimes I remember that I'm going to be that one AEM major who won't graduate with a job. I'm horrible horrible at cover letters and interviews (and I'm abroad so I can't get help from Career Services) and I'm struggling so hard to find a good internship.

Even if I get one, though, I know that I have zero motivation to succeed or do well. I'm just trying to fucking get by, figure out how to live with depression, and stop wanting to kill myself. I won't do well at an internship. I won't do well at a job. I won't do well at life.

I am a failure.
