I have a friend who normally gets everything he wants, he is a very fortunate person. But when he is denied one thing, he throws a temper tantrum and abandons all of his responsibilities. I don't understand how one unfortunate event can prompt someone to basically say "fuck everyone and everything". Maybe it's because I'm use to working hard and still not getting everything. I hate his attitude.
