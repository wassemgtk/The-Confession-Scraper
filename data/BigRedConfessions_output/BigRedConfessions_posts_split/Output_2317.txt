I went to Gannett yesterday to talk to CAPS because I am very sad and I cry every night now that I will be graduating and leaving Cornell. I spent the last 5 years here, and I finished an undergrad and graduate degree here and I love it so much that my life will never be as great as when I was a student here. I feel like shit and don't know what to do. :/ I'm gonna miss this one friend I have who's still an undergrad here, since I can tell her anything and I know she won't judge me.
