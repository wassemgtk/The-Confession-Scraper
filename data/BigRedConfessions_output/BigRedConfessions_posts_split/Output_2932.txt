To all the people who reacted harshly to the kid judging tattoos and piercings - the reason it's silly is because it's voluntary permanent corporeal mutilation that you do to express yourself. Honestly, who's more insecure - someone who cares about what other people are doing with their bodies, or someone who mutilates their body to force a meaning to something they like or believe in. Get a poster. Get a t-shirt. How would you react if someone cut off their finger and said - I did this to honor my grandfather who died in World War II, or I did this to honor my favorite baseball team, or I did this because I think it reflects who I am. And then took offense at your judging her/him. Do whatever you want. We're just saying it's unnecessary and silly. There's a reason people who have serious jobs, who are role models for serious things, who have contributed to society in serious ways - Barack Obama, Steve Jobs, Albert Einstein, etc. don't have tattoos and piercings. It's a highly questionable choice, and you cannot take offense at being judged. That's part of the deal.
