I think there are (not so) secret societies, just for black people, forming on campus. I've seen people in hoods with masks or head scarves on north campus and ho plaza surround by a bunch of other black people. I don't really think it's a problem but it seems pretty cult like. 

[Pretty sure those are initiation ceremonies for MGLC Greek organizations. White Greek organizations probably do the same thing, but behind closed doors. Could be wrong]
