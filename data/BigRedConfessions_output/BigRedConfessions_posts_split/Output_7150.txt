Things have not been well with my roommate recently. I don't think there is anyone in the world she cares about other than herself. I'm the opposite, and this creates a conflict of interest. I want a friend that will care about me as much as they care about themselves.

This isn't a friendship I'm willing to save, I'm sick on giving and never receiving, of being alone when I need someone but always running to you when you need me, I don't want to be used. 

I hope you have a great life and that somewhere down the road you change your attitude, this will ultimately hurt no one but yourself. You can't build strong relationships when you are so unbearably selfish.
