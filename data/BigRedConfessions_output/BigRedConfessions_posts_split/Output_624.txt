"In response to 7521: and all I want is someone who isn't pretentious with his art tastes, someone who understands when I fall asleep during movies it's because I'm tired from my busy schedule, someone who appreciates and welcomes different music tastes instead of making me feel bad about mine, and someone who has a life of their own so I don't feel guilty for trying to live my own. Be less ostentatious please. Your taste in art is not the only valid form and maybe you would know that if you had supported me at all in my artistic endeavors instead of tearing me down to boost yourself up"
