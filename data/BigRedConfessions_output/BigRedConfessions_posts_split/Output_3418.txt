Im married. And I like another married man. Sadly, even though he is nice to me and once in a while spends time chatting with me, I dont think he likes me the way I like him. Im not in love with him, I dont want to spend my life with him because we dont have much in common. But I haven't been able to stop thinking about him for the last 4 months. I will be leaving Cornell soon and I will probably never see him again after that. I just wish I could tell him how I felt. I wish I could read his mind to know how he feels about me. Every time he looks at me, I get all warm and fuzzy inside. I just want to hold him and tell him how attracted I am to him. I hope one day, even if it is just for the day, you feel for me what I feel for you.
