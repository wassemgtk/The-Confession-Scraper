I broke someone's heart to be here (and now I am realizing that mine too) and I don't have anything to show for it. I don't know whether it was worth it, but I will make it worth it simply to be your role model. I am sorry, little one, that you're growing up so alone. I hope some day you'll follow in my footsteps and do a better job than I am doing now.
