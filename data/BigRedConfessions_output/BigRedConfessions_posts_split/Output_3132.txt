"Humans are so fragile. We're so vulnerable and insecure; so uncertain and shaky in our emotions. To deny this or to act against it is to alienate ourselves from our human nature. I wish we'd realise that more often and submit to it, instead of trying to wear this shield of assertiveness and faux self-reliance.

I need you. I'm so fucking vulnerable to you, and I'm not afraid of admitting it."
