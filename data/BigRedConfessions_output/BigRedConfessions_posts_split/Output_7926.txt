While all my friends excitedly tell me all now wonderful their boyfriends are, I rarely brag about you. Whatever I say is meaningless, they see for themselves what you are. They don't like you. They see your loudness, your overcompensation, your shameless boasting about past sex partners, the way you put others down and make me feel insignificant. They see you are fake, but so does everybody else, and they repay your fakeness by being fake to your face too. When I am not with you, it is a relief. I feel safe. I feel content. I do not speak loudly to be heard over you. I feel sad when I see my friends' happiness with their partners, the genuine appreciation and care they show each other simply because they care about one another, not as a means of boasting or duty. Theirs is love. I love them. They love me. And thanks to them I see you for who you really are and I've had enough. Tomorrow I leave you forever.
