This is an oh-so-typical confession but there's a guy who I keep on running into on campus who I really want to approach. We met at a pre-Cornell event and I remember thinking that he seemed really sweet. As luck would have it, we have had many large classes together and we have run into each other quite often over the last few years but I've never had the guts to introduce myself.

This guy seems incredibly nice and is 100% my type but I have zero clue how to approach him. I keep on trying to gather my courage but my confidence crumbles every time I even consider introducing myself. I am already a junior and I don't want to pass up this person simply because I'm afraid of humiliation/ rejection/ attention...
