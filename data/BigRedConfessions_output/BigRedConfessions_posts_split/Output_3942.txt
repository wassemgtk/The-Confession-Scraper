I can't stand the kind of stuff that passes for news these days. The so-called articles that show up in my news feed with titles like "They Couldn't Believe What Happened When They Did This" or "Man Walks Down Street and Sees Cutest Thing Ever"... they legitimately make me angry. People are being tricked into reading this kind of rubbish because the titles make them curious, and all it is doing is dumbing them down. I fear the day when people start to see these clickbait ads as real news... and then I become afraid that it's already happened.
