I'm concerned for humanity. So much violence. So much hate. I can understand how conflicts arrise; siblings, spouses, and friends, let alone Jews and Palestinians, can't avoid it. But in no instance is the taking of a life justified! Both sides must use words and only words. But before that can happen, both sides must recognize that Jews and Palestinians are all equally human; members of both sides are equally capable of love and compassion. Jews love and protect their friends and family the same way Palestinians do. Losing one will cause the same amount of pain no matter which side they're on. One is not less entitled to life than the other. Let's see some peace talks.
