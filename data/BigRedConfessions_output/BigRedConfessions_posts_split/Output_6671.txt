This may sound weird, but I don't really mind when guys come relatively quickly during sex or a blowjob. I've been with several guys who pride themselves on lasting a really long time, and ok good for you, but guess what? That means you get to come once during the night. Cuz like hell am I going down on you any longer after it took hella long the first go round. And fun fact boys: sex is definitely enjoyable for girls, but most don't come from sex alone, so an hour of straight up fucking isn't really gonna cut it, at least not for me. Don't get me wrong, if it takes like 60 seconds for you to come, that's a little too quick. But even if that happens, I totally don't hold it against the guy. If he's at least able to last longer some of the time, I'm happy. And lasting longer does not mean like a half hour -- at least for me, any longer and I'm bored. Eat me out already, lol. The guy I'm with comes pretty quick usually -- lasts a perfect amount of time for sex, and is really really quick with bjs, as in about 15 seconds haha, which is absolutely awesome for me. So boys, don't always feel embarrassed about coming quickly. Make sure she's pleased too and she shouldn't have a damn thing to complain about! :)
