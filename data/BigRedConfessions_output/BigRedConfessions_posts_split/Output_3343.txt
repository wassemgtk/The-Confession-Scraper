This isn't worth it. 

What's the point of going to class, trying to find a job. Trying to become successful in any fashion if you don't have any friends who care about you. 

The closest i've come to human contact in the two years i've been here is this beautiful girl sitting right next to me right now. How can i possibly talk to her knowing she's not going to have any interest in me.

This sucks. Life sucks.
