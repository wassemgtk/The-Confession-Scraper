I feel bad for my friend since she struggled at Cornell in the past. I hope this semester she will rebound and really enjoy her time here. I know my time here was tough at times, but I can say now that I wish I can experience everything again. The real world is not that great. The key to really being happy here is to enjoy whatever you can. I didn't really think of it much until my last two years at Cornell, when I started to become really proactive all over campus.
