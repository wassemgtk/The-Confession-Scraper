It's very annoying when some "Christian" people feel it is their duty to "save" you. Why are they so certain that they have a guaranteed spot in heaven? Is it because they go to church & bible study every week? Is it because can recite a few bible verses from heart? Well here's one they seem to always forget: "There is only one lawgiver and judge, He who is able to save and to destroy. But who are you to judge your neighbor?" James 4:12. #HappySunday
