Words can not express how utterly embarrassed I am by some of the student protestors who talked to Skorton. While some were able to accurately portray student's frustrations about this fee others were ridiculous, profane, and incredibly disrespectful. Do you even realize how much Cornell really gives to it's students? The access to free mental health services, free librarians who are experts in their fields, the amount of students who aren't paying a dime to go here because their parents can't afford college, hell we even get a giant concert at the end of the year! This doesn't mean you cant be mad about the fee, but it means you need to check your privilege as a Cornell student.
