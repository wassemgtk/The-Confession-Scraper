I am such a worthless loser leech and piece of crap. I can't find a job even after graduating from Cornell. I still live with my parents eating their food, and utilizing their house and utilities. I'm a parasitic worm that's destroying the apple which they call their house by living at home. I wish that a car ran me over when I was a student at Cornell, that way I could have saved them the money they wasted on a worthless piece of garbage that I am. I polished my resume, I polished my cover letters writing a personalized one for each job, and I applied following all the rules Cornell Career Services gave me, including for interviews before I graduated. I don't know what's wrong with me. I have always been rejected all my life for a lot of things. I think Cornell made a mistake accepting me as I am an embarrassment to this Ivy League school as I will never be able to give back to society. I can't even find a temporary job serving coffee at Starbucks, since I applied for at 3 local branches and got denied, with the manager telling me that I am overqualified for the position and that I looked "depressed." I feel hopeless. I'm just a waste of space, wishing that I can disappear. Every day I dream I could just vanish into thin air without anyone recognizing me. I think if that happened, no one I knew from Cornell would even notice, as everyone moved on after graduation. I feel lonely sitting at home getting scolded by my parents how I "am just a worthless piece of crap who can't find a job after Cornell." I've gotten to the point where I don't care if I will be poor and homeless as long as I could have some dignity by having a low-skilled labor job to be able to talk to people, make friends, leave the house without being embarrassed by former high school classmates about not having a job after graduating "such a prestigious school," and earn some money to eventually move out of poverty from student loans, etc. I know people will say I am insane, which I probably am, but I have been fighting many demons throughout my life so please don't judge me.
