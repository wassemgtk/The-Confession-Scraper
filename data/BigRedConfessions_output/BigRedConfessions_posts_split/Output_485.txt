In my free time I have built two massive Tesla coils from cheap everyday parts you can find at Home Depot. I use them to protect my apartment from anyone trying to steal my shit. I hope that people like Dianne Feinstein, Michael Bloomberg, or any other liberal politicians don't ban my right to make a massive Tesla coil after learning about them in Physics 2213 at Cornell a few semesters back. They already tried to take my right to bear arms and I don't need the government telling me what is dangerous and what isn't. I like living a life of risk and dangerous, because after all isn't life about having fun?
