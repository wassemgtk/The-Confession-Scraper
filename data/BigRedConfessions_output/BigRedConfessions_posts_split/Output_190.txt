Evolution shaped us to be gene vessels. Then some crazy fluke resulted in a neocortex affording a whole other range of experiences. The result -- never a moment's rest from these two aspects of myself fighting. Humans are quite literally fucked up in the head. All of our problems come from these internal struggles and lack of organization. Shit just happens in your head, you can't reliably predict it, you can't control it, you just have to deal with it. If I was an engineer and could edit the human brain I'd name some serious optimizations. I'd make improvements to the rest of the body too while I was at it -- shoulders and knees are a real mess.
