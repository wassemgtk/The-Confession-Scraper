I'm fat. Not obese, but fat enough to be self counsious around others. I don't understand how girls that are heavier than me who also struggle with being self conscious can hook up with so many guys. How do you get over feeling ugly in front of guys? I want to love my curves, but all I see is fat and when my shirt is off all I can think is that the guy is thinking about how big my stomach is. How do you feel comfortable without clothes on in front of someone when you hate how you look?
