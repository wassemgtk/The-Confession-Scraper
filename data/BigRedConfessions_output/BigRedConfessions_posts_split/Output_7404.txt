I really like the topics that my major covers, however, I think that it doesn't cover the topics deep/technically enough. I don't feel challenged. A lot of people (myself included) consider my major one of the easier of the bunch. I know I shouldn't care, but it bothers me when people say my major is easy and assume that I must not be very smart because I'm in it.
