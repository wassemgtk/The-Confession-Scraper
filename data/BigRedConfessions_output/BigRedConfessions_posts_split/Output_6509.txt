Ever since I came to Cornell, not one single day has gone by where I haven't been reminded of the pain and suffering this place causes me. It never ends. The problems that I, along with many of the other students here, am encountering could easily be fixed if the administration just put in the smallest, most marginal amount of extra effort and attention. Please, Cornell, stop being assholes and start buying better toilet paper.
