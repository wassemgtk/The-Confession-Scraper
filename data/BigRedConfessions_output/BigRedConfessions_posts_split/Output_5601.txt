Earlier this semester I overheard a girl in class tell her friend that, as an EARS counselor, she would privately mock students that she counseled with another EARS counselor. She casually joked about the serious issues the people she counseled had. I haven't utilized EARS here but I have reached out to counseling services in times of trouble. I understand the anxiety and hesitation of opening up to complete strangers about intensely personal issues. While she didn't reveal any confidential information, the conversation really made me lose faith in EARS, which claims to be a judgement-free and understanding resource.
