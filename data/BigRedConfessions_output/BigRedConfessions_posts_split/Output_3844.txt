When people ask girls out on a date, how come they always say "You wanna get a cup of coffee sometime?" I don't even drink coffee! Why can't it be like, "Hey! You wanna go drink a couple of Juicy Juice pouches with me some time?" Or maybe Capri-Sun? Or just plain ass fucking water? I hate coffee! That's why when a really good looking guy comes up to me and invites me to drink coffee, I ALWAYS have to shut him down. So far I've been on 0 dates because of my aversion to coffee. If you had just asked me to go drink some Kool-Aid or anything-but-coffee, I would have been down. Fuck Coffee.
