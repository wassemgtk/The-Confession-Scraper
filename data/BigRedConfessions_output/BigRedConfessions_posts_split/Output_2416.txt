I had been so good all year at keeping my depression in check but now it's back full force. I tried reaching out to friends so as not to sucumb completely but just being blown off once by each person was enough for me to completely withdraw from them. No one knows that I call my mother every night and cry in the phone for an hour, or that I cry myself to sleep every night, or that I go watch the sunset just to cry by myself. People that I friends with just a month ago now feel like strangers. My sorority is no help. I'm just so genuinely lost and I no longer know who to seek solice in.
