So I'm home for break, and like every other family does when they get together for Thanksgiving we talk about current issues.

But anyways, here's this list of info I found about one of the more culturally relevant topics I've seen on my newsfeed: http://oldroots.tumblr.com/post/103684581063/rosethomass-if-you-like-me-get-so-angry-when
