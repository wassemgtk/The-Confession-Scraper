"Well, this has devolved into what I can only describe as a clusterfuck. Completely FUBAR. Yes, I was wrong in snapping at you. I knew that from the beginning. I can at least admit fault there. However, YOU were the one who escalated. You were the one who verbally slapped me in the face. You wanna know why I blocked you? Because I would have returned fire a hell of a lot harder. Think about how angry and hurt you were when I said something I didn't know would hurt you that much. I can be a hell of a lot meaner when I'm trying, and since we've talked so much, I imagined a hundred nasty retorts within the first few moments. But, since it was never MY intention to hurt you, I shut you out instead. Can't hurt you when I can't see you, right? Sounds a little bit like Elsa to me.
But back to the point. I was always going to unblock once I could think about it without a metric fuckton of vitriol and when I could address it like an adult. But, you seem to have taken a route that I hope is similar to the one I chose by unfriending me. I hope that you'll talk to me when you're not so angry. But if your goal was solely to hurt me, rest assured, you've succeeded, and if that was your only goal, can we at least be professional when we see each other rather than ignoring each other?
I was going to wait to address how your message made ME feel until you were willing to talk, but since that doesn't seem to be occurring any time in the present future: I'm sorry I hurt you so much. It was never my goal. However, you have in the past seemed to have judged me on that very issue you claimed to support. How many times have you told me I should go out to certain parties? Additionally, if you feel everyone treats you this way, you need to stop and think. Not for my sake or everyone else's, but for yours. It's like the saying, if you smell shit everywhere, check under your shoe. Perhaps it's a line thing again, and you can't see it for some people. I honestly don't know, but I think you can figure it out. But I can't help someone who doesn't want to be helped as I tried previously. Finally, I was absolutely furious that you would judge me so harshly when I spent a good deal of time trying to help you by being a friend and avoiding any and all judgment.
So, I don't know where this is going to go. Maybe, like me, you're too mad to deal with it yet. Maybe you need to hear me say sorry first, though, when I was first too irate to do anything about it, I promised myself I wasn't going to bring it up until you did. Or until you were ready to say sorry, because, yeah, I do feel that I'm owed something of an apology. Maybe you're too mad to deal with it, period. I hope not. That's a bad way to go through life, not just burning bridges, but nuking them. Anyway. I'm sorry. I'm not mad anymore, pretty much. I will be if you attack me again, but I'll try not to lose my temper. If you wanna talk or build a snowman, well, you know where to find me."
