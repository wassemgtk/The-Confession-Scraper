With all honesty, I understand that people have problems that we can't even begin to comprehend. But at the same time I feel like its all in the mind. We have the power to overcome obstacles, tangible and intangible. Suicide gets you nowhere, we are privileged to be in this university, regardless of its climate. We all have great futures, stop thinking about suicide. It's only 4 years.
