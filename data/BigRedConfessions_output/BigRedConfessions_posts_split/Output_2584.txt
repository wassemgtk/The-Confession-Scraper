Do guys like girls with small boobs? I've been with several guys who have made negative comments about my size :( I know that it's important to love and accept myself and I'm working towards it but sometimes it's hard because I want to feel desirable too. I'm too insecure to hook up with or pursue guys I'm interested in because I feel like, once I take my shirt off, they will lose interest. Thoughts?
