So long-story short, I'm having a young-life crisis or rather an "A-ha" moment regarding my professional plans.  I recently changed my major and I'm even taking classes outside of Cornell. Anyway, I just want to address how thankful I am to be in a college that allows me the flexibility to totally revamp my plans at the stage that I am at! I can't imagine how I could ever make it through Cornell, stuck in a path I've simply lost interest in. Finals aren't even over, yet I can't help but think about next semester in my new major! For the first time in a while I feel genuinely happy and grateful. Merry Christmas, Hanukkah, etc. everyone, hug someone you love today.
