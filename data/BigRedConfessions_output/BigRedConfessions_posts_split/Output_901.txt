Have I overstayed my welcome?

Something seemed off yesterday. I felt like there was something they knew that I didn't, although whether or not I was supposed to know is beyond me. I’m usually the one who always wins. I’m the one who people need. I'm the one who doesn’t need people, right? I’m the one who doesn’t care, right? Yet I left that place over-analyzing every interaction for some reason, wondering about myself. When you stand out so much already, the margin of error is low. I want to tell myself I was thinking too hard. But I’ll never know.

Some people seemed wary of me this time, and more than the usual, expected amount of wariness that comes with being so unexpected. Joyful people were subdued in their greetings. I feel like I made mistakes that I don't usually mistake, but I can't determine the specifics. Someone said I was welcome, and I know I am. Still, at the same time, some people sounded like they didn’t believe themselves when speaking acceptance into reality. Almost like they regretted lying.

Sometimes, briefly, in moments of awkwardness, I get a sense that I am still a surprise, when maybe I don’t want to be anymore. Is it because I am not emotional enough? Did I say the wrong thing? I wish I could slough off this cloak of fear, doubt, and uneasiness surrounding me. I've never wanted to be apart of something more badly than I did at that moment. I've never wanted to be accepted, to be apart of the group, more than I do for these people. 

I hope I'm overthinking all of this.
