"I don't know what's wrong with me. I haven't really liked liked anyone since 2012. The next person I even considered being with was chronically unavailable. OK screw all that I thought; at least I can get laid in the US, I thought. Even that is not happening!!! I don't know where I'm screwing up. I don't even want a commitment or an adjustment or anything. Just want to hook up with cute guys and stay in bed all night with someone. Well, I guess I should get back to just studying :-/
