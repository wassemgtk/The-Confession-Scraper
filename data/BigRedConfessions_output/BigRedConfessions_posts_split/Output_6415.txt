Some times I look around and I see all the people smiling and their beauty is overwhelming, all in their own little worlds. What would it be like to share a personal world with someone? This isn't an idle fantasy, nor a complaint of loneliness. This is a contemplation of the trust, moments and sunlight that could be shared with you, special person. My heart actually aches. Twinges at the thought of cutting a hole in the wall of your world and looking in, becoming entrapped in the dew-covered web of your life. It's with an animalistic jealousy that I watch you smile. But my world is invisible to yours, so all you'll see if you spot that hole in the sky is a warm glow of friendship. Best try shooting an arrow.
