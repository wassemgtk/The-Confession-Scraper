"This part of my life is called Insane Running!

Had two offers of admission. One completely funded(tuition+living+flights) by a similar ranked college in London. Other ""fully unfunded"" offer from Cornell. Wanted to go to Other one, screwed my mind. Went to airport to catch the flight to US 1.5 months and ran back from the airport to see me catching another flight the next day again to Cornell.Reached US via Japan. Lived in temp acco for 20 days (literally troubled the guy), paid no fees, didn't attend any class for whole month and even had to go for counselling for depression. One week back to give a last attempt to other offer, took a 550 USD cab to JFK from ithaca (leaving Cornell without withdrawal) which btw the driver drove at super speed to make me catch the flight in 4 hrs. Took the cab without booking a flight ticket to my country. Reached one hour before the departure of the international flight, booked the ticket at the airport, boarded the flight  and entered my country via Istanbul. Got the visa for UK, and in the next two days left my country to London. In London now for the past 6 days and here I am looking (as of now) to catch a flight back from Heathrow to JFK for tomorrow 4 hrs before my prelim exam at Cornell. 1.5 months and I have just been running around the whole world with all the luggage. This part of my life is just called ""Running"". "
