I hate the popularization of memes so much. Once upon a time they were fun little jokes shared in a free and spontaneous environment, but now they're churned out by the great 9Gag Reddit Factories by the truckload. What's worse, with this quantity comes a MASSIVE drop in quality, to the point where things that used to make me smile now make me grimace. I am seriously considering just unfriending everyone that posts terrible image macros on facebook. Just stop, no one thinks you're funny.
