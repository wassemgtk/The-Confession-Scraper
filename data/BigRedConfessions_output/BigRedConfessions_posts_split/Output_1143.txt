It's hard to accept that when you lose a relationship you lose a dear friend. Fuck the flaccid cock I was in a relationship with, I want my friend. Technically we could be friends but unfortunately the cock and my friend are intrinsically linked and i dont want to deal with the cock. From strangers to friends to partners to strangers again. The circle of life
