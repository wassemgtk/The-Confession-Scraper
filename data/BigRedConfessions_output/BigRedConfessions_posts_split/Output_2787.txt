Architects, I get it that Dragon Day is your thing. I actually think it's cool, and I'm happy that you all get so into it. But, if you are harassing engineers, and interrupting our studies, don't be surprised when we're a little upset. It's one thing to interrupt a freshman lecture, but it's another to go up to engineers who are obviously studying in Duffield, dressed up as stereotypical nerds, and pour Purell all over someone's arm. That's not funny, that's harassment. Just keep in mind that engineers are typically very stressed out individuals, some of which have reached the end of their tether. If something like that happened again, don't be surprised when one of us snaps. Have your Dragon Day, go nuts. Just leave us alone, please.
