I feel like I'm the only person who doesn't want to go back to campus at ALL. I would give anything to stay at home close to family and my girlfriend. I feel so much happier here. I chose Cornell cause it's an Ivy but it's too far from home. I should have gone to community college or something so I could just commute. I need my family.
