Life is complex. One day you may feel on top of the world, and the next day you may be carrying its weight. Through trials and tribulations that I have undergone in my life, I have seen emotions as both vital, and as a hindrance. But there are a few things I have discovered. If you have a dream, go after it. Life may push against you, but you can always push back harder. If you love someone, tell them. It may be hard, you may be scared, but at the end of the day you have to trust yourself and believe in them. And lastly, you have to believe in youself. You can have an entire nation believe in your potential, but if you dont believe in yourself, it doesnt mean a darn thing.
