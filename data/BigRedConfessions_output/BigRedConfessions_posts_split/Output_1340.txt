To 6661: I am a man who had a similar and extremely intimate experience with another man. I understand the fear, as I also am perceived as straight and would like to think I am. Sexuality is a gradient though, dynamic, and constantly in flux, subject to the experiences of that moment. In this moment, you are gay. If you love her, or even like her romantically, then l believe you will do what feels right. For me personally, those experiences greatly shaped my understanding of sexuality and I welcome the uncertainty of whether or not I'd be willing to fully out myself should I have another moment like the one that occurred years ago. I also welcome even the remotest of emotional attachment or strong love for--any male friend of mine. I'm not afraid to tell a guy friend that he's good looking or that I love a certain thing about him. Anyone that wants to shrink back from or feel uncomfortable about that is not worth my time. For you, it may be that this is not just an exception, but rather that your internal conflict is resisting other signs. Or maybe not. Either way, this is all apart of the process. Not sure how much this helps, but if it reaches you, feel free to reach out to me through here and I can give you more specific advice! No matter what, you'll have your girlfriend. :) :)
