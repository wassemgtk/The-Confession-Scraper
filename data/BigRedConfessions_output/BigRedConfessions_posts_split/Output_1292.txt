I was asked to withdraw from Cornell last semester. I'm applying to new schools and haven't gotten in anywhere yet. These are schools that I would have been extremely overqualified for if I applied back in high school. Now I feel like that middle school kid who always gets picked last for kickball. Except I don't even get picked.
