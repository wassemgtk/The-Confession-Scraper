Is it bad that sometimes I hate everyone here for having it so easy? My family was so poor at one time, I didn't eat lunch during elementary school. My mom sewed our clothes by hand while working 2 jobs. Please tell me what was so hard in your life? Expectations? Oh, I had those too. Why do you think I'm at Cornell? Just remember, there's always going to be someone out there who is or has been worse off than you and be grateful for 3 unlimited meals a day and your top notch education and designer clothes.
