In high school, I felt emotionless, almost robotic. This semester, I'm pretty sure I've shed more tears than in the rest of my life combined (both out of happiness and sadness). I haven't decided yet whether I'm thankful for finally being able to feel emotion or disappointed because Cornell has caused me so much sadness, but either way, Cornell has changed me. If not for the better, at least it's made me grow.
