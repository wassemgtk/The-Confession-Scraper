"To the people who posted #1458, #1473 and #1486: There's so much hate here I'm feeling hesitant about sharing my story. I feel like all points in the three posts are valid, although everyone seems to be responding to their own experiences so they are probably getting angry at each other for no good reason. So I want to offer my story, which is a situation where all three posts apply. I guess a large part of me agreed with #1473 and so I felt surprised when #1486 posted such a strong response. I felt like collateral damage when #1486 indirectly attacked me. I just want to offer a different point of view, and point out that things are much more complicated than it seems. Hopefully this post helps other people know that it is important to be a good friend, but it is also as important to be good to yourself too by knowing when to call it quits.

So, here's my story. I have this friend who went through a lot with me in freshman year, so we share the same tragedy, loss and emotional baggage. We both had help from EARS and Gannett for the same reasons at around the same time, and so we are (were?) close. But then I got better much faster than she did, most likely because I was really fortunate to have found a great support system in sophomore year. She, however, started drinking massive amounts of alcohol, doing some recreational drugs, and hooking up with random people almost every night. I don't judge her for doing any of those, but I was only worried because after doing those she would completely forget everything that happened and go into a panic attack.

At first, it started off gradual and didn't seem like too big a problem, because she will always promise that it was a one time thing. I tried my best to help her, and so did our sorority sisters. We would sit with her and dry her tears till she passed out in bed, we would force her to go to Gannett, and we would drop everything we were doing to get to her side when she called. Her boyfriend was a horrible influence and when he really screwed her over, we tried our best to compensate her relationship problems with more sisterly love on our end. To be honest, it was inconvenient sometimes but I never resented that. This lasted for a year or so but I would always be there. Finally, her drinking and other coping mechanisms moderated out and for a moment, we were all glad. Personally, I had a much smoother year, occasionally breaking down because of academic stress or resurfacing PTSD about once a semester. She was there for me too, for which I was grateful. It seemed like our friendship was headed towards a great direction after all the things we have been through in the past two years.

But after she and her boyfriend ended, she started picking on my ""survivor's guilt"". It started off as small insults that we would laugh off, such as being a ""nerd"" that cared more about studying than most people do. But after a while, the insults escalated in frequency and intensity and I realized they were not meaningless jokes. Whenever she got drunk and upset, I was still the first person to be there for her to talk to her. But she would verbally and emotionally abuse me for having ""moved on okay"" after the tragedy we both experienced in freshman year, and that I would never understand because I'm okay now. She would say that I only tried to help her because it made me feel better about myself. She pushed me away, sometimes physically.

She would call me names and when she sobered up she would apologize and blame it on the alcohol and act as if nothing happened. She would then repeat this cycle again. I bottled up that guilt and hurt like nothing was wrong, and cried myself to sleep thinking about the nasty things she would say to me. I didn't want to confront her or cry in front of her because I knew she had enough on her plate and to be honest, the survivor's guilt was getting to me. I felt like I had no right to burden her.

But my therapist told me that it would be best if we would both give each other some distance, for  the sake of both our mental healths. I did so by signing up for more clubs on campus, getting more busy and finally meeting more people, but I always tried to be there for her when I could, until one day she said things that I don't think I can ever forgive her truly. Again, she apologized when she was sober and pretended nothing happened. When she realized that I was still upset about what she said, she wanted to stop being friends with me, went behind my back to my other sorority sisters and told them similar words of confession #1458: ""When I want to talk to you, you seem annoyed. To be honest it seems like I'm always there for you, but you're never there for me."" 

Was I really never there for her? I don't think anyone who was involved in the friendship could honestly say that. But why would she say that? Maybe to gain sympathy or just take it out on me. Honestly, I don't know. But that brings us to confession #1473, because as much as I feel sorry that I cannot be there for her anymore, I think she has failed to ask herself what she has done to push me away. I want to be a great friend and be there for her, but not when doing so gives her the power to break down the emotional and mental wellbeing I have worked so hard with Gannett to build up. I love her, but I have to love myself too. 

And lastly, if confession #1486 sees this, I hope you don't think I'm an entitled asshole just because I agree with #1473. I really tried my best, and I wish my friend and you can understand that it was so easy for someone to be accused of ""never"" being there when in fact, being friends with her, taking care of her and living in the survivor's guilt she imposed on me, took up so much of my own college life. I hope you understand that I have to move on. I'm in a good place now where I don't really have much ""shit"" (in #1486's words) to deal with, so forgive me if I'm happier now, forgive me if I don't want to live in survivor's guilt, and that's all I ever wanted for her as well. I'm appalled that #1486 would ever wish the worst upon anyone when you don't know the stories of people following this confession page, and I really hope you don't ever do that again because you never know who you accidentally hurt.

And to everyone else, if you read till here, I'm sorry I had to get everything off of my chest, and hopefully this helps anyone who is having personal or friendship problems by letting you realize that it is important to always love yourself. Gannett really helped me through my struggles, and hopefully you will let them help you too.
