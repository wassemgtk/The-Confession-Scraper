I have a good life. But people can be so mean. I am good at showing I don't care, but it is seriously damaging. A lot lately I've been thinking that it would be better if I wasn't here. I wouldn't have to worry about things anymore. People's opinions of me or not liking me wouldn't matter. Not having to worry about what job I will have when I graduate or finding someone to spend my life with. Just all the things that I worry about for the future would disappear... and I wouldn't have to think about it so much... that would be nice. 

It's not even that I'm morbid.. I am very happy. I just don't see the benefit in staying. The only thing that is keeping me here is my mom. She is my everything and I love her too much to do that to her. So yeah.. not really a point to this. I don't need "I'm here if you need to talk to me" or "it will all be okay" responses. I just needed to share what was on my mind. And my mom isn't dying anytime soon. so don't worry about me.
