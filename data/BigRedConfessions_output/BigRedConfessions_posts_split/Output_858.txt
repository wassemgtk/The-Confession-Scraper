Well, my last semester at Cornell is coming to an end. No, I'm not leaving here with a degree. I am transferring out to another university in the Spring. You'd probably expect this post to be a bash on the stress and isolation of Cornell that affects its students. While this is true, and stress and isolation have had a big impact on my time here, this is not the reason for my post. I believe it was my own fault that resulted in my withdrawal from Cornell. I did not make the most of my time here because of my life circumstances, and myself. This is a prestigious school, and I was just starting to make good friends here that I will soon let go of. A part of me wishes I could stay, but a part of me wants to leave, and because of personal and life issues, leaving was the path that I chose. I have no idea what the future holds for me, and I am anxious to find out and continue my journey that is life. Even though I associate this school with a sad and confused stage of my life, I will still miss you Cornell.
