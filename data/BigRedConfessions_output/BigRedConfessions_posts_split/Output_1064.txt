I didn't realize I was gay until freshman year when I read something in a class that brought up that women would feel angered/unsatisfied/negatively emotioned if they were in a relationship with a closeted gay man. Until that point, I thought I would be able to have a relationship with a woman, because I personally am repulsed by sex; I really just want the romantic aspect of a relationship except for sex to have children. But over the past four years I feel like I've realized this is less and less practical. And now I am wondering if this last year is the year I "come out". I've been trying to tell myself I'm not even closeted, and I'm not ashamed of being gay, but since I don't care about sex I've never discussed it and I feel like my sexual orientation is moot. But I'm still hesitant and sometimes cry about this because I want a heteroromantic relationship but I feel like I'll be judged. 

I have gotten by so long because this isn't something that I put much thought into--I don't care for the most part. But I do care when I occasionally dream about having children and what memories I'd share with them only to remind myself that this will never happen. (I know adoption is an option but every dream is of my own blood children.) I also begin to care when there is this guy I'm inexplicably attracted to (the only one I have ever been) and I'd like to talk to my friends about him but, again, I'm hesitant to "come out".

Not even sure why I posted this because I'll anonymously look over comments and ignore any suggestions. I don't think I'm ashamed of being gay. I just don't want to be gay. I just want a family.
