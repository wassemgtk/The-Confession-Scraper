"To the person who thinks that ""I'm always there for you, but you're never there for me"", maybe you should think harder about why that is the case instead of just assuming that it's your RIGHT to have someone be there for you. Maybe you freak out over the smallest things. Maybe you freak out every day. Maybe you never take your friends' advice anyway. Maybe you have done something else to annoy your friend. 

There are so many possible reasons why someone does not reciprocate. You should never assume that just because you have contributed in the past, that there are no other factors that might have taken away your right to expect the same in return."
