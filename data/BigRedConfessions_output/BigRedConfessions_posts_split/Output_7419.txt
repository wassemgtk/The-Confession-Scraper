I'm an international student and coming to Cornell was the biggest mistake of my life. I don't have any true friends. I don't have anyone who I can really rely on in this campus. It makes me feel so lonely and I can’t even tell my parents about this because I’m afraid they might worry too much about me. I hate the judgmental looks on some girl's faces when they see my English isn't perfect. Cornell isn't an welcoming place for international students and I just dislike every moment of it. Maybe that is why I'm trying so hard to study abroad and graduate as soon as possible. I really don't fit in anywhere in this community. I'm too much of a "fob". I just can't wait to get out of here and start my new chapter of my life.
