This place has changed me a lot. I am counting down the days to graduation. If not for my parents, I wouldn't even go to graduation. I'm trying to forget about this place as soon as possible. The day after I graduate I will cut ties with anyone I knew here. This place taught me that no matter how hard I work I always suck. I kept on waiting for the hard work to pay off and you know what? It didn't. I don't have a job lined up and will graduate without one. I wish I had gone to my state school every day, but you have to live with your mistakes I guess. If I ever have kids, I will not send them here. I wouldn't want them to suffer like I did. The only good thing about going here is that I'll graduate with only about $3000 in loans. My "friends" have no idea I feel this way. They will never know. I never let anyone get close to me. I tried once freshman year and it didn't turn out well. So, I surrounded myself with a barrier so thick you would never get through. I've already started to ease my way out of friendships. I know what its like to not have friends from high school, so its no big deal. The only thing that makes me smile is thinking about my life after Cornell. Living in a shitty apartment, working some job that I hate that probably has nothing to do with engineering, and coming home too tired to do anything but sleep. Maybe a dog or cat if I can afford it. At least, I'll be away from Cornell.  Future students, you have been warned. Other Cornell students might not agree with me and that's okay. Everybody has their own opinions. But, it's better that you hear both sides of the story and not get caught up in the prestige and name. Ultimately, it's all up to you and you have to live with your decisions and that's not easy. Take it from a guy who regrets his decision every second of his miserable life.
