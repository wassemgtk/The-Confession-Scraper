My favorite thing to do is to mix coke and whisky in a bottle and go for long walks around campus and Ithaca. Its a good way to relax. I guess one of the benefits of being a guy is that its not really dangerous. If you notice a guy with bottle of coke in his hand just lounging around, feel free to say hi. On these long walks, I do a lot of thinking. Mostly random stuff. Sometimes I think about how little I actually care about my life. I don't really want/need a high-paying job. Partly because I don't know what to do with the money. I don't have a lot of loans. I don't spend on clothes or food. I really only eat a meal a day. My hobbies are inexpensive so what am I supposed to do with the money. I don't care where I end up. I wouldn't care if I died tomorrow. I'm pretty much a lone wolf anyway. Sometimes I think about what if I chose a different major. My parents picked engineering for me and I just went with it. Turns out it's pretty interesting. But what if I chose art? or history? or wines? It's weird that I've also thought about a detailed plan to kill myself if I ever want to. I don't know if I'm depressed. I don't know if I'm an alcoholic. I don't know and don't really care to do anything about it. I'm not happy. I'm not sad. I'm in a constant state of...meh.
