I was so eager to come back home for the winter break. 
But now I wish I was back at Ithaca. Something has changed since I left home for college; my parents have taken to assuming the worst in me, and the apologies they give when they find out they were wrong do not make up for the hurt they caused me. And I know it'll happen again. 
I want to go back to Ithaca. Where the people who love me the most won't be able to hurt me the most either.
