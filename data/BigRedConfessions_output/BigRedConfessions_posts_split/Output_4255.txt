Suffering from an eating disorder in college is too much.  I went through a ton of therapy and I didn't think it would follow me here, but it's actually never been easier to get away with it.  I'm always "too busy" to grab lunch or dinner, and no one notices or thinks twice.  Every time I don't eat something, even if it's healthy, I'm proud of myself.  This is a scary struggle that people avoid talking about, and I don't think it gets enough attention.  Sure, many people have many different problems, but why are people so scared to talk about anorexia and bulimia?  Maybe if people talked about it more, I wouldn't be so afraid of telling my friends what I'm going through.  Maybe I could get help.
