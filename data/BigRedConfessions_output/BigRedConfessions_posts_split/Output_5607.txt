I wish I had someone to study for my finals with, but my social anxiety makes it really hard for me to work with other people... I have this weird fear that people are always judging me, and it makes it nearly impossible for me to participate in study groups or office hours. Yet, I learn so much better when I can talk to someone... I just don't have anyone I trust enough who is taking the same classes as me. Oh well, here come another round of failing grades :(
