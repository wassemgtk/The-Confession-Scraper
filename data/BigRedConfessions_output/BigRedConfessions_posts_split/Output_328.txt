Paying 20 bucks for a concert at Cornell is ridiculously cheap. Take advantage of all of these concerts that CCC sponsors, because concerts after graduation tend to be significantly pricier (i.e. Kygo, Grimes, Klingande, Family of the Year, Modest Mouse, ZHU, Formation World Tour---all concerts this past year or coming up in NYC), and even concert days such as Gov Ball, EZoo and Coachella can be very draining on your wallet.
