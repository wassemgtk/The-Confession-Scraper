wanna hear something great? I used to get made fun of in high school ALL THE TIME by the popular couple, the ones that we're voted class couple. Like brutally made fun of. Now, three years later, that class couple is still together.  What's funny is that the guy tries to hit me up all the time, and wants to fool around with me behind his girlfriend's back. Plot twist: I'm a guy, too.
