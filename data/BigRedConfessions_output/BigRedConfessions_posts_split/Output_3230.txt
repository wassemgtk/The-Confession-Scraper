*Please do not think I'm fat shaming or condoning any of that type of behavior.*

Having been overweight before, if you want people to be attracted to you, you might want to lose some weight.  It was hard for me to imagine someone not liking me because of my weight.  It was unfair, I thought, that anyone would withhold feelings because of something so petty and shallow.  It took me a long time to realize that I couldn't be butthurt about what people did and did not find attractive.  I could bitch and moan all I wanted about how fit guys with shit personalities would get all the ladies while I was alone, but it wouldn't change my standing with women.  The thing is, you can't be mad that people aren't turned on by you, regardless of what the cause is.  It's not their choice to be turned on or not, and it's irrational to expect someone to enter into a romantic relationship with a person that doesn't rev their engine.  

That said, as long as you're comfortable with who you are and you're comfortable with your standing, there's no need to change.  But yes, it may close some doors for you, no fault of yours or the potential partners who aren't physically attracted to you.  There are people who love curvy women, or fat women, or obese women (I don't know where you fall), but the vast majority of people are turned on by physically fit people.  I think it's an evolutionary thing, or maybe it's programmed into us by society, or both, but whatever it is, if you lose weight, you will open so many doors for yourself.  I did, and now I'm having better luck with women.  

Sorry if this is rambling, or unclear, or offensive.  I just thought I'd share my opinion and experiences.
