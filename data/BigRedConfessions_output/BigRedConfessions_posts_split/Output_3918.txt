"Every once in a while, I go to a Christian Bible study group on campus.  I’ve tried a couple different groups, but every time I go to one, I leave wondering why I even went.  My problem is that I completely support homosexuality.  I’m straight, but some of my best friends are gay, and I will stand up for LGBT rights until the day I die.  However, when I participate in these Christian groups, it’s inevitable that someone is going to bring up the sinfulness of homosexuality; it’s happened every single time I’ve gone.  And I can’t handle it.

The really interesting thing about the Bible is that you can use it to justify absolutely anything.  At the Bible study I just went to, we were studying Galatians 1:11-24.  In the excerpt we were looking at, Paul is reflecting on his personal journey from a life of evil (ordering innocent people to be executed was basically his job) to a life following the righteous path.  Anyway, when we started discussing what Paul meant when he said, “the gospel that was preached by me is not man’s gospel”, one of the other group members piped up.  He claimed that this could be interpreted as refusing to support homosexuality, because if you believe that being gay is acceptable, then you’re believing in the false words of man over the true gospel of God.  However, my first reaction after reading the passage was the exact opposite: when Paul is talking about his dark past, he describes himself as “extremely zealous […] for the traditions of my fathers”.  He is ashamed of his blind acceptance of the evil ways of his predecessors, which I thought was perfectly applicable to the way all people can become more accepting of formerly shunned things like homosexuality.

But now we get to the heart of the issue:  if I go to these Christian group meetings, I have to stand up for my beliefs, which are not the same as the beliefs of the average Christian.  But I can’t do that; I can’t go to these meetings and hijack the conversation every time someone bashes homosexuality.  I want to, but it’s just not right.  It’s like a feminist going to a meeting of misogynists and hoping that someone will share their opinions.  Please don’t take this the wrong way.  I know that Christianity is so much more than the one belief that I don’t agree with.  But I just can’t do it anymore.  I can’t go to these meetings because I can’t stand by while these things are being said.  Gays, lesbians, bisexuals, transsexuals, and asexuals are the way they are, and they aren’t doing anything wrong.  They can’t change, and their existence is not hurting you in any way.  And if they’re sinning by being who they are, then I guess I might as well do a little sinning myself by supporting them as much as I can.

I’m sorry, but I can’t go to your Bible studies anymore.  I’ve got more important things to do, like getting out there and showing the world that love is for everyone.
