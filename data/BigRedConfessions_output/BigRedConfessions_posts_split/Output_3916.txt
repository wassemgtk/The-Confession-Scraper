Coming from a working class family, I've always tried to show kindness to the people in the community who work hard to keep the roads clean, serve our food, and do maintenance work, etc. Having said that, I've come across more than a few workers on campus who have a really disdainful and, I think, racist attitude to a few of the students. I've unfortunately been on the receiving end of some of their contemptible actions on more than one occasion. I know I shouldn't generalize, but this city/town really pisses me off sometimes.
