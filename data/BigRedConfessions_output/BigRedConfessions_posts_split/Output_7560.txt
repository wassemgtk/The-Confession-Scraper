"To be perfectly honest, it took everything in me to make sure I'd never see you again. It used to be easy back in the day when I could axe someone out of my life and not think twice about it. But now I have regrets, and I feel that I've made the wrong decision.

Do something to make me feel that it was the right decision...or give me some way to make up for my mistake."
