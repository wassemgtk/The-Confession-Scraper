Since I know a lot of people deal with depression and eating disorders, I don't want others to see such problems as unusual defects or something. So I always tell myself not to hide or feel embarrassed about myself. But every time I try to be confident and tell people about my problems, I become terrified with thoughts that they might think either I'm mental or just seeking attention.
