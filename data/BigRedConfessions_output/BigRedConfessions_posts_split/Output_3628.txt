I can't stand breaks from school. The work at Cornell can suck sometimes, sure, but the thought of having a whole month at home with no schedule scares me. I know it's my own fault for not finding more things to be involved with (I have those opportunities), but I end up sitting around and lacking the motivation or confidence to do something as simple as ask my friends to hang out. At least school gives me some structure.
