I hate it when people, both of and not of my race, group me with my race.  I may be black, but that doesn't mean that I'm low-income, disadvantaged, or have any particular desire to go crazy over the recent incidents regarding race.  Sorry, but not sorry, that hasn't ever been my life experience.  So don't speak for all black people (or any other minority), because quite frankly, you can't.

And obviously, I can't say this in real life, because then I'd get sh*t on.
