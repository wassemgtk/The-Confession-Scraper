"Went with my gut and stopped by CAPS the other day. I just needed to talk to someone. It turns out the reason that I've been feeling so shitty and emotionless and unfocused and just miserable all the time was because I've been suffering from moderate depression for the last eight or nine years, but I've just been unconsciously repressing it. Walking out of those doors was the happiest that I've felt in a long time. I just wish I had ignored my parents sooner and sought out counseling when they insisted that I didn't need it. I wish I wasn't graduating in a few weeks, because I know that life would've been completely different.

If you're feeling down at this school, stop by CAPS. Talk to someone. You don't have to tell anyone. It turned the tide in my battle against depression, and I would have eventually killed myself if I hadn't had that talk. This is a mild case compared to some of the things that make people depressed here, but I'm confident that talking to someone is worth a shot."
