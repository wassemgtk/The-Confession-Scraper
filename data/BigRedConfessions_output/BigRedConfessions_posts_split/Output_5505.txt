I think I made a mistake cutting someone out of my life.  I know this person could never be the friend I needed, but when he got me, he really got me.  He's dealt with some of the same trials I have and it is hard trying to connect to those who haven't.  There is so much judgment that it is hard to let your guard down, but you still try.  But when the people you try with don't understand, it is that much more painful.
