I want a relationship. I'm not bad looking, and I have an all right personality. that isn't the problem. The problem is that I freeze up, and have a panic attack every time I think I might have a shot with someone. I get so damn scared, that I start sending mixed signals. I don't know how to get around this....I'm tired of being alone.
