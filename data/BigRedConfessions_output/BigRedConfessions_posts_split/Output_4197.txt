I have a friend who thinks it is ok to take other people's things without their permission until they explicitly say that they are not ok with it. He and I disagree on these fundamental set of rights, and he calls people "stingy" when they call him out for taking their personal belongings. Said friend also takes off his shoes in lecture and other public areas and rubs his too-large socks all over his lecture hall seat and the backs of seats. I'm not sure how to go about resolving these issues.
