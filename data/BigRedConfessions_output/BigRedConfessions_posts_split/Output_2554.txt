That awkward moment when you wake up and look at the clock and realize it's 1:30 PM.... but wait hmm... something's not right.... Could it be that.... YES! I opened my eyes AGAIN and the clock shows 8:30! I AM responsible after all. Nice try, brain. #dreamwithinadream Hmm but wait..... I just had a terrible thought....
