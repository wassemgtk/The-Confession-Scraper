Today I was not feeling so well so I decided to hide near Barton Hall and smoke some marijuana for the first time that my friend gave me. I was seeing colors and walked into Barton Hall I think it was and the place looked like it had a celestial sky. I don't know what happened later but I awoke in between the tunnel between Barton and Teagle without my shirt on. I feel like an idiot.
