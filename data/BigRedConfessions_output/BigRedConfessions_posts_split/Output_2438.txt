I've had a few women tell me recently they found me cute (and presumably wanted to date me). I do like them in theory and I do want a heterosexual relationship, but am a cross between homosexual and asexual. I get horny thinking about men receiving blowjobs (not usually me giving them), or me receiving them (from any sex), but when if it ever came down to it, I don't think I could ever have sex (and if I did, I could only imagine it being vaginal). I don't think this should be a big deal, but I've only started thinking about these conflicts while at college, and it seems that it's required for someone to be sexually attracted to another to be together. Ugh.
