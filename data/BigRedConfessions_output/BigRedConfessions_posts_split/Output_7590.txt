While at Cornell, I have never gone out. I've never been to anyone's dorm or apartment. I have never eaten with someone. I haven't exchanged numbers. I spent my birthday alone, with not a single "happy birthday". I often go all day without uttering a word. I have no idea why this is so. But is. And I hate it, I hate it so much. The worst part is is that this is my second year at Cornell.
