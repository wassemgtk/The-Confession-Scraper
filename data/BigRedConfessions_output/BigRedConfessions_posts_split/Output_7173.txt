I am pretty sure my roommate hates me now.  I told her she smelled bad again.  I told her in the beginning of Fall semester that she needed to wear deodorant.  Any of my friends that come to my too agree that when she walks in, she just does not smell very pleasant.  She made me mad the other day when she told me my best friend couldn't stay the night, so I kinda flipped out on her over text.  She talked to me about it a couple days after and said it wasn't very nice, and it was kind of rude.  She said none of her good friends or anyone has ever told her that.  Well thats because they probably didn't want to be mean.   Well I'm a bitch and she hates me.  It's been awkward ever since.  How am I suppose to spend time in my own room when I can't even stand to be in it.  It had to be done, although, probably not so mean and now I do feel bad.  FML.
