As an international student, I am often asked what the biggest cultural change was for me when I came to Cornell. Generally, I say that there really wasn't a big cultural change because, you know, this is the 21st century. However, I've been thinking about it, and I realized that there was actually a cultural change - except I only realized after having a terrible first semester.
All my life, I studied at a school I loved. Although people complained about schoolwork and things like infrastructure and administration, I never met a single person who GENUINELY hated the school. At Cornell, however, I see more students complaining about things than actually rejoicing their education here, whether it's on Yik Yak, or just during everyday conversations. The constant moaning about the weather (which honestly isn't even that bad), or the complaints about classes and work are extremely depressing. Since I realized this, my life has been so much better. I have begun to look past this layer of glumness and find people with more positive attitudes. I have discovered that there are people here who love Cornell - it's just that the whiners, cloaked in anonymity, are much more vocal. Now, I constantly remind myself to see past the negativity and revel in the opportunities I have been provided. It's a privilege to be here, and I can finally, after one semester of gloominess, say that I genuinely love Cornell.
