I'm terrified that you're going to make me fall for you. You weren't supposed to feel anything, and neither was I. So if you're playing with me now, for fun, for pride, to see if you can, or just to see if you can make me yours, don't. Don't mess with someone who has both felt, and dealt, heartbreak.
