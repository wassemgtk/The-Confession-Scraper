I AM OUTRAGED over the changes at Goldie's. Not the organizational part... that's more efficient now. But to stop serving breakfast at 11 and charge extra for breakfast sandwiches? I literally spent half of my BRBs on those things last year. Everyone loves breakfast sandwiches, whether it's 9am or noon. Give us back our sandwiches, dammit.
