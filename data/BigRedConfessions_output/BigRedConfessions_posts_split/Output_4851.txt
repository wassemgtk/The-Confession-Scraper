"It's sad that I have to feel  so trapped in my own home. To be shamed, silently.. To come home and have to isolate myself within the deepest depths of my mind just so my parent won't read through my expressions and see all the ""terrible"" things I've done in college. I can't even give the slightest suggestion that I dated one of my really close guy friends, or have kissed or been somewhat intimate with someone, or more than one person. I can't share these details without being looked at as corrupted or dirty in my ""religious"" household, I mean, my parent's mind..as if they were the end all, be all of righteousness. 

So what if I lived while I was away? So what if I've formed my own opinions? So what if I've once and for all decided that no one else should have control over my actions because they are my own?
I had begun to mold myself while I was away. I began to own up to my true identity. Then I came home and felt so oppressed. 

I am not guilty of anything that is really wrong.
I don't want to let my whole life pass me by and then regret not following my own impulses. 
I just want to be free, mistakes or no mistakes.
And finally, that's what Cornell gives me the chance to do. "
