ahhh...... I just received an e-mail that i did not get into a summer internship that  i applied for. F***! this was my top choice. I havent heard anything from the others that i applied and i fear that when i get the e-mail, i would read the same.
this is so discouraging. All i need is one experience. plz give me one.
