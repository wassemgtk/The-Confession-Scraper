So like...when the admins graduate...do they just pass it down to another Cornell student? It's almost like this page is a secret society....gasp..oo..ahh.

Admin: There are multiple admins on this page (as I mentioned previously) and we will graduate at different times. As admins graduate/post less regularly, new admins are added to the team.
