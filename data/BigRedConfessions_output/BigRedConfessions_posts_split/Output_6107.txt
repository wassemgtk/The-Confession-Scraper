These last few months have had their ups and downs, but when you came along everything changed. Let's just say I'm serious about this. I wouldn't trade you for anyone in the world. Neither of us are perfect but we can get pretty damn close when we are together. This isn't goodbye, this is life- and I wouldn't choose to stay faithful to anyone else. The journey is upon us.
