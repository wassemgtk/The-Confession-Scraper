"To all of the people who post on here about their depression and suicidal thoughts:

Listen to me. I have been there. What you need to do is get help, not post on a confessions page. Modern medicine and counseling are ridiculously good at what they do. Go to EARS or Gannet. Go get help and I guarantee you won't regret it. One little effort, and you'll see the light and feel happiness again, just like I did."
