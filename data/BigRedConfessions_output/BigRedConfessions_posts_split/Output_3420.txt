I just finished a graduate school interview weekend. Every hour as I tried to sleep, I kept waking up from horrible anxiety nightmares about all the slightly awkward moments during the interviews and being convinced that only an idiot would accept me to this school. Wow. I didn't even know I was this stressed out.
