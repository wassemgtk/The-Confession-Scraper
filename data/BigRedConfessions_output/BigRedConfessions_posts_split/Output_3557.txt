One time I blacked out during O-week and I ran around a frat naked and stole one of the brother's bed sheets from his room to cover myself when I came to and realized I had no clothes on. No one saw me, but the brother ended up being my TA for my ENGRI course. I couldn't look at him in the eye all semester.
