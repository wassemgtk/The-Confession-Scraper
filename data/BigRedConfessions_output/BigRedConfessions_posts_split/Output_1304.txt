I'm a Cornell alumni that graduated last year. I have been seeing a lot of negative posts about Cornell and just wanted to say this: If I could leave my home country and come back to Cornell, I would do so in the blink of an eye. It was definitely a stressful school. I was so depressed in my first year that I sought out counseling from CAPS. But guess what? The pressure that Cornell gave me and the support I got from CAPS made me a much stronger person. Cornell changed my personality, which is helping me thrive at work today. Of course, there are pros and cons to every school. But Cornell is such a big community, you would surely find people that you can click with and call them your secondary family. 

If you are feeling stressed, just remember that this is temporary. Cornell pushes you out of your comfort zone, but that's not a bad thing. Appreciate every day that you have there as there are so many of us out here who can only wish to be back to that beautiful environment. One day, this could be you :)
