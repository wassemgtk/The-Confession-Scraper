"I miss you. But I can't say it. I met you 7 years ago and loved you ever since. Now with graduation coming in I can only hope that by some small chance we'll end up in the same city - or at least not 1700 miles away. 

If you were here I would grab you in my arms and never let go. I would let you know that I've always loved you. Your laugh, your smile, everything you are and everything you aren't. Maybe at this point it's a dream, maybe it'll never happen. But maybe I'm a bit old fashioned and still believe in those love stories. Maybe I'll keep waiting for tomorrow, like I have today, and did yesterday. 

Loving you still, 7 years and counting."
