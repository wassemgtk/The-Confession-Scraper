I want to let everyone with mental disorders know that it does get better, but only if you put in the concerted effort to make it better.

I was born with the nasty concoction of anxiety, depression, and self-esteem issues. I hated my life, I hated myself, and worst of all I lacked the belief that I had the ability to improve my life and my mental conditions.

But after wasting 17-18 years of my life wallowing within my own misery, something within me clicked. I was sick and tired of living life the way I was living. I was tired of my shitty existence. I decided then and there that I would put the concerted effort towards improving my mental state, improving my life.

I spent most of my free time scouring the internet, reading self-help articles, self-help books, and self-improvement books. I started meditating. After a while, I gained the courage to put what I learned and read into practice in real life. I tried talking to more people, putting myself out there more, smiling more, being more positive. It was the hardest thing I've ever done. But it started working. My negative thoughts and my lack of motivation started to evaporate. I started getting along with others. I started to love life.

I'm not nearly at the place where I want to be, but the amount of improvement I've made in the last few years is, in my opinion, insane. To my brothers and sisters who are struggling with mental disorders, I just want to let you guys know that it's possible to pick yourself up and carve out a better life for yourself. It's hard as FUCK, believe me I know. I know firsthand that misery is so, so, so comfortable. But i promise you guys that if you work hard, you have the opportunity to make it better. Love you guys, peace.
