I only realized recently that I am depressed, and have been for a long time. Maybe I've subconsciously known all along, but I've finally decided to do something about it. May all the walls I have spent so long building up around me come crashing to the ground at my feet, because it's time to finally let someone in, even if that someone is a counselor at Gannett. I don't care if I'm crazy anymore, I just want to be happy.
