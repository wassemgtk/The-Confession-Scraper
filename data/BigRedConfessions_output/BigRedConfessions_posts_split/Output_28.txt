Today I gave my number to this one girl I like. Normally this is a good thing, right? Putting myself out there to see where things go, if anything. Sure, but after my friends and I did a bit of Googling, it turns out that she's a devout Christian. It's not the fact that she's Christian that makes this awkward; it's the fact that she's someone who is "100% not going to be interested in a lesbian relationship with the least religious person ever" that makes this awkward. So the 0.01% chance I thought I had was more like a 0% chance ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Moral of the story: google who you like BEFORE giving away your number!
