From my direct observations of other students and having read some recent confessions, I have to conclude Cornell University as a school has failed us (the students) in many ways. When we were in high school, most if not all of us worked our butts off to go to a school like Cornell. Why? Because of the connections to be made here, the networking opportunities, because of the doors that the Cornell name can open - there are many other schools with great teachers and research, but with prestige and an alumni network like Cornell, I see many students entering feeling very confident about their job prospects. They try to come here because it means future job security, or goal security (eg better likelihood getting into law school, etc). This I completely understand, as I was the same way in high school. 

However, as a senior I can see that Cornell, quite honestly, fails in the department of supporting its students in need. Sure we have career fairs, we have Career Services, we have that alumni network. But I see so many students who have performed decently here competing desperately with other students to snag spots at big companies or even just jobs in their field. Career Services often gives advice that students who have done their hard work and research already know. It should be simple at a place like this to talk to Career Services and have students quickly hooked up with multiple alumni that have openings in their companies, or collaborators with the university, etc. Networking events should be about students getting jobs and internships, not hundreds of students desperately clawing for 2-3 jobs with the majority of them turned away. I of course understand that the most prestigious and high-paying jobs will always be reclusive, even among elite students, but the fact that so many Cornellians are unemployed or can't find work in their field is just sad, and it's sad that the university barely lifts a finger to help.  A professor recently told me, "I believe that if a student can't find a job for at least 6 months after graduation (not for lack of trying), they should be reimbursed their tuition." Obviously it's not feasible, but I would LOVE to see the effects of that on Cornell because it would force the school to pick up the slack. I see plenty hard working students, undergraduate and graduate alike, left in the dust by Cornell because there is no reliable system to help students having a hard time in finding work. 

Furthermore, Cornell doesn't really have a system in place for helping students reliably achieve their goals. I've found students are supposed to flounder about when trying to figure out how to eventually land that great industry job after graduation, know exactly what's needed to get into medical schools (since GPA and MCAT isn't all of it), or graduate school. Instead it's sort of a wishy washy deal where they will give you vague advice if you seek it, and most of it is poor. (For example, I have wanted to enter a Ph.D. program directly after undergraduate since I was a freshman but was told multiple times to wait to start research until the end of sophomore year...possibly some of the worst advice I've ever been given and followed considering research is the #1 importance for graduate admission). Another one of my friends had to figure out on her own that hiring from the internship pool is one of the most reliable ways to work at a large company. Yes it might seem obvious to many of us, but it's not so obvious to a young student who doesn't understand connections are everything nowadays. Because students aren't given the proper advice and guidance they are apt to make mistakes, and with mistakes come failed goals and unemployed alumni (since Cornell doesn't do anything to help students or make connections for those who made such blunders). 

Both these problems show that Cornell, essentially, doesn't care about its students as they are guideless and left to fend for themselves once it comes to leave the university. Nor does it properly prepare many students for their future aspirations. Thus, my opinion stands - Cornell has fundamentally failed its students.
