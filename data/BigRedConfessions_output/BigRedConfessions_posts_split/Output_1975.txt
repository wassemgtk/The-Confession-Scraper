I stopped enjoying porn--and, by association, masturbation--about a year ago. Porn is just stylized, exaggerated, unrealistic sex, preceded by abysmal acting. It's male-centric, degrading, sexist, and just the worst in every way. When I masturbate now, I feel like there is a constantly expanding cavity of air beneath my temple, a pressure that consumes my intellect and morality. I recently read an article that found a connection between decreased gray matter in the brain and the viewing of porn, so that doesn't help my situation. 

I only jack off now in order to maintain the allusion of normalcy. To relieve the sexual tension that is nearly inevitable for any adult. I used to have a bad habit of fetishizing and romanticizing certain types of women, and now I feel a dark guilt cropping up from my gut whenever I watch porn. The sadistic irony is that I'm masturbating in order to escape the habit, to keep myself focused and kind whenever I interact with people. And it works. I just wish there was some other way, or that I could be truly asexual. 

I'm happy with my life and generally amiable, or at least that's how I believe people perceive me. I'm even nice, normal, and decent with the opposite sex, until I get any kind of attraction to them, that is. Then things go haywire, and my sexual urges lead to ill-advised decisions (not the twisted cruel, rapey kinds but the sad, awkward, socially inept kinds that ruin good friendships) and things don't work out and then I masturbate. Sigh...

What I want is a relationship, not sex. In fact, at this point in my life and mental development, my thoughts on women have led me to believe that sex would be the last thing on my mind, should things work out for me. Of course, this is assuming I continue masturbating every once and a while to lessen my libido. There is a bright side though: Even though I'm still human and therefore weak-minded when it comes to masturbation, I'm feeling like I finally understand the whole girl thing. I haven't had any success yet, but I also haven't tried. And I don't plan to anytime soon. Which means I'm stuck masturbating for a while. But at least I am more confident these days that I could end this vicious cycle, that I could secure a relationship. And then I'll stop, because all of my sexual desire will be replaced, I presume, with love and the desire to not fuck up my first and only true success story. I'll be too focused on being the best boyfriend I can be to continue with this madness. So I'm optimistic. I'm happy. And to all women, until the day comes that I can put this behavior away for good, I am sorry.
