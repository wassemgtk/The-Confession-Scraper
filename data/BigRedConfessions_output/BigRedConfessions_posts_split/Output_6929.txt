I opened up to you in a way I never did with anyone else before. And the next time we talked you left me as you didn't want anything serious. A week later you were with some other guy in a serious thing. All the while you've been stringing me along as your "best friend". Which is a bunch of shit. We hardly talk or hang out. When I ask you to spend time there's always something to do, but you can make time for anyone else. It hurts a lot. You used me as your rock. I will always want to be there for you but now you don't need me so you're done with me. It feels shitty. I give you the emotional support you want but when I need someone, I cant talk to you. I just want to hold you close at night and tell you you're beautiful. And yet now I cant even talk to you at dinner without being berated. And I thought I loved college.
