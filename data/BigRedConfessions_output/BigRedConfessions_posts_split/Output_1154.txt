I thought I really liked women (as a guys), was sort of a male feminist due to my mother, and was actually kind of a homophobe, but my experiences this year and a few very recently have made me feel a very strong disgust towards women...I just can't imagine spending any part of my life with a bitch, who is self-obsessed, ungrateful, and unclear in her communications (being passive-aggressive). Even though the idea of having sex with a man used to sound disgusting to me, I think its psychologically better for me to date a guy - the guy won't have all the feminine issues, would think like me, and be clear in communication.

This is just a rant. I, at this point, hate girls, and am reconsidering my sexual preferences.
