I hate the way I look. I'm fat/chubby and everyone on this campus is so thin. I eat right and I try to work out but it doesn't seem to change anything. Pounds and calories are not just a number when you're extremely overweight for your height, they're a way of life. I'm worried I'm developing a eating disorder but the only time I feel in control of my body is when I'm telling myself no.
