In the past couple weeks, I've walked past conversations where I hear 22 years old exacerbated at how "old" they are. In my passing their conversations, I also know that they're graduating. And they're marveling at how fast the time has passed. I'm a adult learner at Cornell, so I not only have some perspective on age, but a deep appreciate for the passage of time. Trust me, as each year, 5 years 10 years, wow! where did 20 years go!?!? that pass, your wonder about it will continue to grow. Right now you might think that you can't imagine being 30 or 40 or 50 or 60. How far can we go? 100? I recently heard that a 96 year old Holocaust survivor recently applied to Cornell!!!! The difference between lamenting about the passage of time and embracing it will be your attitude, your ability to adjust to changing circumstances, your openness to other people's worldviews (we all want the same things, we just have varying means), and your willingness to continue learning. Do I think I know it all? Do I think "it's all about me"? No and no. I trust you to find your truth. I know you'll continue to try to make this world a better place for everyone. Be kind to one another and to those who didn't have the resources to make to the Ivy League. I love you all.
