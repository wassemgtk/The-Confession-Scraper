Lately, I have been thinking about what happens when we die. As a Christian I like to believe that I will be reaching God's home, but I am scared. I don't want to disappear into an abyss. I feel as though the devil is temping me to believe that life after death does not exist. I wish I had a friend here who could reassure me because I don't really have many friends and those that I do are all atheists and try to denounce my beliefs.
