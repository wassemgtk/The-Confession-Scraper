Over three years ago I submitted a confession thanking a TCAT bus driver for waiting up for me instead of driving away. The reason is that I ended up dating someone I met on that bus and things looked promising. Someone commented that if things end badly, I'd be pissed at the bus driver.

That person and I ended up dating for three years. They were the love of my life. Our relationship sadly ended on bad terms. I'm still grateful for what the bus driver did, though.
