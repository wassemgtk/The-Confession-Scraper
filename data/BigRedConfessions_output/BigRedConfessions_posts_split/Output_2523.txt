Dear guy who thought it was funny to jump in front of my car Saturday night,

The Idiot of the Year Award hasn't been given out yet, but you'd make a great candidate.

Furthermore, to anyone out on Friday and Saturday nights, drunk or not, Ithaca streets are really poorly lit in general. So if there's an oncoming car, assume they can't and won't see you. I'm sure my homegirl Kathy Z would say the same thing.
