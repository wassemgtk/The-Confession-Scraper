I was going to take a shit in Baker because I thought no one used the bathrooms there. So i casually walked in an choose a stall at random. I didn't expect anyone to be in the bathroom, but when I opened up the stall, there was a guy taking a shit there. Not only was I surprised that he didn't lock the door, but he was so surprised to have me walk in on him that he stood up and flashed his dick. There was an awkward pause between us and he said "Oh sorry" with no expression and sat back down. I turned around and immediately left. I didn't even take a shit there.
