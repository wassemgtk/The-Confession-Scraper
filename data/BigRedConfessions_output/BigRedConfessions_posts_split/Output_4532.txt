I have a health condition that no one could ever know about unless I told them and right now it isn't a crazy big deal but I have to keep monitoring it. The thing is that it causes pain that is manageable but it's still pain and I've talked to my doctor and there really is nothing I can do to get rid of that. I hate that I can't scream about it to the world because people don't understand that every day I experience this pain and it doesn't go away and it won't go away. They don't know that I am living with that. They don't know how frustrating it is to go to doctor appointments regularly as they delay the inevitable mention of the surgery I'll need down the line and potential for it to become cancerous. They don't have that constant reminder that something's not right with the way their bodies work. They can't conceive that and I can't expect them to, but I want them to know that extra stress that's added to my life. Is that selfish of me? To want that attention? I don't want a pity party I just want people to be considerately aware of my situation.
