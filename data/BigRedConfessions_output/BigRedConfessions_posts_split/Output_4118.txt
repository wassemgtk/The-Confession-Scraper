"I knew this was going to be a rough year. I even told most of my friends that I'd be focusing all of my time on work this year, and I apologized in advance for not being around as much. I didn't want to lose touch and I tried to make the best of the time that we had last semester. And sure enough, here I am - just a quarter through this academic year and rapidly burning out. I see the pictures of all of you going to parties and mixers, going on dates, hanging out, having fun. Meanwhile, I'm alone with my work and miserable - professors don't realize how much their assignments pile up on students, or maybe they just don't care. Lately, I feel like I've been rowing up shit creek without a paddle, and any mileage I've made would have been made so much easier with a friend now and then. I'm sorry that I had to focus on work and personal things. I'm sorry that I'm not around. I'm sorry that I'm here, watching the time tick past through every essay, exam, problem set, lecture, experiment, and meeting. But most of all, I'm sorry that I'm not in those pictures again, having fun with all of you. I'd at least like an invite now and then, even if you knew that I couldn't make it. But maybe I overestimated our friendships, and maybe you have moved on.

Maybe I'll see you again next year, maybe not. Maybe I'll try to find other people, because maybe it's too late or too strange for me to reconnect with you - especially after how easily we drifted apart in spite of how fantastically we connected. Maybe I'll go through with transferring and never get another chance to see you again - maybe you've already forgotten about me, and maybe it's for the best. I miss you, and I hope that I can see you again - I can't even invite any of you out to eat, considering how strangely my schedule works. I've got a lot to think about, but for now I've got work to do. In case I decide to leave, this may be my last goodbye to you. I hope that you will all have good times, good luck, and a good night."
