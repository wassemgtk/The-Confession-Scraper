:(

We've been "dating" for awhile now.
I know you don't want anything serious, but you make me so happy and I feel so many types of ways about you...and I know you feel the same.
But I also hate how I'm always making the first moves and trying so hard for your attention

UGH, but I also told myself that I'd wait until you realized how great we are together and ask me to be your girlfriend.

And I guess I just wish you'd ask me to be your girlfriend sooner.
