"On tuesday this past week, I woke up and couldn't think of a reason to start my day. I missed my morning classes, I had a bunch of papers due, and had errands to do for orgs, but I couldn't think of a good enough reason to get started on anything in particular. This is how most of my mornings this semester have gone, and I'd almost given up doing anything about it. That is, until that tuesday afternoon, when my stomach started growling after lying in bed for hours and I couldn't even find a compelling reason to eat. Suddenly the thought came to me: ""Because I want to live, don't I??"" Once that crossed my mind, I threw myself out of bed, forced myself to eat breakfast, and took myself to Let's Talk.

Depression's a really scary, insidious thing that can pervade your thought processes in ways you don't even realize. It took hitting my own proverbial rock bottom to seek help, but I know many are not so lucky. If you find yourself feeling like less than yourself, feeling lost and purposeless, and not enjoying or not motivated to do things you love, don't ignore it. Don't wait until it's too late to do something about it, because pulling yourself out of that headspace is no easy feat.

For any of you who feel like they're past the point of no return, with little will to live or conscious/unconscious thoughts of suicide, don't give up no matter how hard it feels. You're not broken, and you don't have to feel as awful as you do right now. I'm not out of the woods yet, but I have hope again that I'll pull myself out. A quote I've found really helpful lately is, ""You'll never find the life you want if you refuse to live the life you got."""
