I am so scared of my life. I have spent the last one month crying alone in my room. To be honest this is the most I've been stressed. Being kicked out of Cornell because of my low grades scares me. Rising sophomore with no specific major in mind. I don't mean I didn't have a major in mind before coming here but the requirements are way too much for me and I find myself spending all my entire week in the library- and then the grades come out,still bad. I have started hating everything, everyone and Cornell in general. I can't pretend it's okay when for sure am losing it. Even after confessing I'm still scared. I don't want to graduate and still go back to being poor.
