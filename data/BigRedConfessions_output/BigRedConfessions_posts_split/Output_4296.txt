The number of guys in frats at cornell that are gay and closeted is insane. I'm tired of going on dates or having guys hit on me but then tell me they are in a frat and don't want anyone to know. I totally respect being afraid of coming out especially in the frat culture, but stop being surprised when I say I'm not interested in dating in secrecy, I know what I deserve and I'm not settling for anything less. And no I'm not going to give you head on the down low, suck it yourself.
