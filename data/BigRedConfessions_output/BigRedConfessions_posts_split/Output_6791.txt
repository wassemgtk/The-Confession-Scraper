I'm home for spring break and I don't want to go back to Cornell after it's over. I can't believe it took me this long to figure out what my dream school and perfect match is, and it's definitely not Cornell. I don't even have good enough credentials to transfer; I've just been wasting my time, and I should be looking to the future to better my time at Cornell, but I'm too angry at myself to do that. I'm stuck in a hole, and I don't know how to get out.
