I am a horrible person. 
All my life, I prided myself to be a good person. I suck at my field, I am not going to do well in a job even if I get hired by someone. I am not attractive and probably will die alone or settle for the first available option. Through all this, I used to think that maybe my niceness and my honesty are good things that will take me somewhere. Now I realize, I am not even nice. I am consumed by burning jealousy, hating people I love for being better than me at talking to people, or making friends. I tell myself I have social anxiety, that's why I cant talk to people I don't know or make friends, but that's just an excuse. I am loser! That's why people don't talk to me. And my friends suffer through my constant whining because.... I don't know why! Perhaps they feel sorry for me, or maybe they don't want to look bad. I care for people and immediately feel bad for doing it because I expect people to do the same for me. That is not caring. I hate it when my friends have other friends, because it reminds me how I am incapable of making friends or making people like me. I am enraged and jealous that my friends get hit on regularly by boys, when I haven't even been looked at once. I can't be genuinely happy for anyone when something good happens to them, because I am jealous that nothing ever works for me. But I still lend the shoulder to cry on for people because I feel important when I make them feel better. I am a horrible person and nothing will ever change that
