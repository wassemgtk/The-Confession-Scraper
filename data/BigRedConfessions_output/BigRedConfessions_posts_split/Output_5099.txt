"In the fall, I'm going to be a senior, and I'm done with random hookups and short relationships. In the fall?  I'm going to find the love of my life. 

She's going to be confident but not cocky. She's going to be smart, but she won't be a know it all. She's going to have ambition and dreams that may take her all around the world, but we'll make it work. She's going to care about how she looks, but her looks won't rank high on her list of priorities (or mine). She's going to have a wild side, but she'll know when to relax. She's going to be able to teach me about all the things she knows and cares about, but she's also going to listen to me when I ramble on about the trivial things I care about. She's going to push me when I'm losing motivation, and she's going to come to me when she's struggling to stay motivated herself. She's going to live, laugh and use Oxford commas sometimes. She's going to like this confession, and I'm going to message her about meeting up for coffee one day before the semester gets crazy.
