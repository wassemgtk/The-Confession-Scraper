So my friend recently said my other friend and I should become an item, and while I do like her and could 'like like' her, I think of how my parents would react, because I am pretty sure they know/think I'm gay. While it might be true, I don't have traditional views on sexuality and don't think of it as something that needs to define a relationship or what genders the relationship comprises.
