Sometimes, after breaking up you need just to forget everything. You keep yourself busy trying to distract yourself from thinking of her. But as soon as you fall asleep, a fascinating romantic movie starts in your dream. You have a wonderful date with her, you go to a restaurant, chat and laugh. You dance together with an awesome song, you make love with her. Lots of enchanting memories. In the morning when you wake up, you understand that all the efforts from yesterday are gone, you need to start the “forgetting” process from scratch.
