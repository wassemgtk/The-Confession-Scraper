I'm gender-fluid so of course sometimes I feel like the gender opposite to that on my birth certificate, but I still feel constrained to having to dress like the skin I was born into. Not that your style of dress dictates your gender, sexuality e.t.c., but I wish I could just be able to downright dress the way I want and really be able to express who I feel like without some people on this campus giving me looks.
