Now that I've left Cornell with the intent to transfer, I can think of only one thing that I would do if I were to go back for one day. I would approach every girl that I never had the courage to ask out and tell them how I thought they were beautiful people both inside and out. 

It takes a lot for me to just like someone as a person, and if you've made it to the point where I think we could pursue something further, you deserve a medal!
