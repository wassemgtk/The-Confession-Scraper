I meet an incredible woman yesterday. Strong, beautiful, resilient, fun and a smile that makes me melt. We stayed up all night singing together. Video chatting all of the songs that I love, songs I never thought other people would know. Much less like. 

She made my day, my night, my month, my year.

Here's to when I mess it up. or merely wake up from this dream.
