Can people please stop whining about losing jackets/wallets/ID cards on the Overheard page? Like, seriously, try keeping track of your stuff for a change.  Most of us go to that page to read funny quotes from our fellow students, not to find out that someone has lost his or her black jacket (with ID and keys in the pocket OH NOES) at Level B or a frat party.  You're abusing the group and you are STUPID.
