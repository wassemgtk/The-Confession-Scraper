I tried to kill myself on Sunday. I took my meds and some alcohol and tied a plastic bag over my head and fell asleep. I woke up later with a wicked headache. There was a hole in the bag. 

But then I went downstairs to my friend's apartment and she made me a dumpling. It's good to know that I have real friends. My pain is still there and real but they help me mitigate it and I'm getting a little bit better each day.
