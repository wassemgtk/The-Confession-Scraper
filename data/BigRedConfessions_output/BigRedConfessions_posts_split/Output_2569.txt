I just saw that video of the lady who put her kids in cold showers and had to go to court for child abuse. I had no idea that was considered child abuse. I saw it and I just started crying, because that's what my parents did to me all the time when I was little. Yeah it fucking traumatized me and really strained the relationship I have with my parents, especially my dad. 

But the worst part to me is that my mom is a high school social worker. Her entire career revolves around reporting abuse and counseling kids who went through it.

She still doesn't see anything wrong with how she punished me.
