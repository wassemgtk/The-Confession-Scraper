First she said our first prelim grades would be posted Tuesday during fall break. They weren't. Then she said they would be posted Saturday morning. They weren't. Then she said they would be posted Monday by 5 pm. They weren't....Quit messing with me already! Stop posting deadlines when you're obviously not going to keep them. It just gives me anxiety. (Or, since you want us to be understanding of your inability to keep up with the progression of the semester, maybe be more understanding that we're probably having trouble keeping up, too, as students, and make the prelims less insane!) *end rant*
