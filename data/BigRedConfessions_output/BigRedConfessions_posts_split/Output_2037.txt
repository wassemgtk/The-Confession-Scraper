I'm a homosexual man and don't really like the whole idea of "gay culture" and "gay lifestyle" that the American mainstream media and the gay community itself try to portray themselves with. To me, it's very promiscuous and superficial. Just because I like other men, doesn't mean I like dancing and grinding with five other guys. I want something more than just a hook-up you know? Being out in the gay community, you're kinda stuck in this "hook-up" culture that dominates the "gay identity".Whatever happens to true love? And cuddling, and cooking together? Isn't there more to life?
