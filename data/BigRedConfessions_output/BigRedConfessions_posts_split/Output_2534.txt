Sick and fucking tired of all these white people tears on this page. You want to know what is racist? You telling people of color how to act. You know what is racist? Thinking you know better than people of color. You know what's racist? Trying to dictate the way people of color get our freedom. You know what is racist? Getting all upity and sad when people of color want to discuss issues that face us without white people coming in and telling us how the fuck we should act. Who the fuck are you to come in here and tell other people how we ought to fight for our rights that are daily infringed. How fucking dare you tell another person when or how to get what is ours. You want to help end racism? Shut the fuck up. We don't need your input, because we've seen how white people "end racism" and black and brown people are still daily dying in the streets at the hands of our government, being disenfranchised by the millions, and given disproportionately long prison sentences due to racist sentencing guidelines. I've had enough of your fucking white tears. Get over yourselves and maybe think about why people of color find it so fucking annoying that white people have to stick their noses into everything. The world will survive if you just sit back for once and let people of color decide our own future by ourselves. We want to determine who we are and where we are going and how we are going to get our rights for once in our 400 year history in this country and we can't even do that because white people feel bad. Use your white guilt for something useful, but stop bothering us with it.
