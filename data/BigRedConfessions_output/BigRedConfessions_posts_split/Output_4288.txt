So, I've tried having a relationship with a few different girls now, and each time it ends with me getting bored a month or so in, and dumping them. The high school version of myself thought having a girlfriend would solve all of my problems. He was wrong. Luckily, one thing I have learned is that having a girl doesn't make you necessarily better, but the converse is also true. So, I'd say my confession now is that I don't know what to do. I'm contented not having a girlfriend, but I don't know what to work toward anymore. I thought life was about love, but I believe less and less in it each day. And that's fine. It's not in a depressed way. Hell, I was hella depressed before all this. I guess what I'm trying to say is that I always had thought the point of life was to find someone to love, and give them everything. Outside of making money for the hell of it, I see no point of getting a job. I feel a bit lost. Not sad lost, nor lonely so much. It's more like what I felt like the first time I realized I didn't have any strong religious beliefs. Sure, I like to think there is a higher power, but inside I know I just think that to make myself feel better. So here I am. Sitting typing into my laptop in my underwear, preparing for job interviews. And I don't know what I'm supposed to do.
