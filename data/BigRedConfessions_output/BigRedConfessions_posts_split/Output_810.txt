I started out with a 2.3 GPA my first semester, and just ended my second-to-last semester with my cumulative GPA being a 3.52. I hope yall know that a bad GPA is not the end of the world- and that you CAN improve! 

Also, join an extracurricular. People ask me how I improved so much, and my first answer is joining a club that I loved as soon as I went into my second year.
