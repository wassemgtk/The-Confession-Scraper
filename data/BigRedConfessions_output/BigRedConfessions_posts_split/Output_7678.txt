OMG, I am soooooo lazy, it is unreal. I hate work. I HATE it. I hate putting any amount of effort into anything. I'm literally too lazy to live. Living seems like too much effort. I may be the only person who's felt suicidal not because their life sucked, but because I just don't feel like living it, it's too much work. I am so going to be a homeless person, even an Ivy League degree won't save me from that fate.
