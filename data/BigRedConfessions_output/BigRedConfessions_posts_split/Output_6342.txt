Even though at the end of the night I still don't have a girl and I still might be the loneliest one, I'm glad that I can finally take joy in others' happiness instead of jealousy. As a musician, I finally am willing to provide entertainment and perhaps something more for others, without any selfish reason. It's a difficult process, but I'm trying to be more selfless. Being single all the time can be rough, but I just gotta forget about myself for awhile.
