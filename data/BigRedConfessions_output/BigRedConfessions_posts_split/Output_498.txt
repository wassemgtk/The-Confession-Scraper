I feel pretty sad and lonely, but mostly just out of place. I have friends, I have people that I know like me, but nothing ever just feels right anymore. There are plenty of distractions to keep my mind off it and I started taking antidepressants over winter break, but I feel like February break is going to suck because of all the time I'll have to dwell on how unhappy I actually am.
