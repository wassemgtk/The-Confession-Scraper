"To the girls screaming outside Donlon and the one guy who repeatedly kept yelling SOPHIA, thanks for waking us up at 2 in the morning. No one cares that you know people. Please be respectful and let people who want to sleep SLEEP.

I'm just in a pissy mood because the one day I get to sleep in I get woken up by these morons."
