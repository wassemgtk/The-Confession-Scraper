In my 4 years here I've never had any problems with Gannett, and have always defended them to others. But after my last appointment I really get where the criticism is coming from. 

I got there 15 minutes early in case there were any forms or anything else they wanted me to do before the appointment. The nurse took my weight, height, etc, then told me the doctor would be in shortly, as she was finishing up with another patient. 

Forty minutes went by alone in this room, with no one stopping by to communicate anything, and I began to wonder if I'd been forgotten. So I went out to one of the receptionists to ask how much longer it would be (I'd given myself over an hour for what was supposed to be a 30-minute appointment, but I did have classes afterward), and she became visibly ruffled/upset, as if to say, "HOW DARE YOU QUESTION US."

I shrugged off her reaction, because miscommunications happen all the time. But then apparently half the office had been informed that I had dared to ask for more information, because when the doctor finally came in she kept passive-aggressively referencing the situation, and when I went to schedule the follow-up appointment, the staff were awful. 

TL;DR: What the hell, Gannett. I'm sorry I questioned your divine authority and didn't clear my entire freaking day just in case you saw fit to use all of it?
