It's been a hell of a four years. I've suffered through depression, suicide attempts, eating disorders, bipolar disorder, and more. I've spent more time in Gannett than I've spent having a social life or spending time with my friends and sorority. But I've met the love of my life at this school and for that I am grateful.
