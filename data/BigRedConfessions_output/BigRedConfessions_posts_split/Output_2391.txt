I considered you a really good friend and you treated me like shit. It hurts to realize that you never considered me an important part of your life like I thought. You hurt me without a care about my feelings, you used me to make yourself feel better, and you sold me out for your own gain. I thought we were friends but you only care about yourself. I hope you realize your mistake someday but you're so fucking narcissistic that you'll probably keep on thinking you're God. I hope you're happy, but I really doubt you are.
