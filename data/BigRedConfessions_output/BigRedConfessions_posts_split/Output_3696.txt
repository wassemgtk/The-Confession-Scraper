"This poem is quirky.
I don't like beef jerky
and unlike a possum
you make bangs look awesome.
I do like star fruit,
your smile is shoot
what is that word... cute.
I took ESL
and went to Cornell
to learn to spell ""spell""
so I could say -- well,
your charm is a spell
and you are so swell.
But rather then dwell
too much on this verse,
I'll ask an advance
that is quite terse:
Please give me a chance.
