"I'm always complaining about school and talking about how I can't wait to graduate. And that's completely true, I can't wait to leave behind the tests, homework, and stress. But I know I'm going to miss the amazing people I've met during my years here, and it's going to be difficult to leave them.

I'm going to start saying that out loud more often before we reach graduation, but in the meantime here's one for you: I'll miss you all, and I'm glad we had this time together. I don't know how I'll get through next year without you, but thank goodness for modern tech to keep us in touch.

And if you're wondering if this is directed to you, then yes, it is."
