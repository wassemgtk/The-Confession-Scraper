Back in the day before the drug revolution of the late 60's only the top students made it to Cornell. Today everyone fells entitled about everything and receives second chances. If you failed a semester and flunked out of Cornell, you entered the workforce or entered the military. There was no in between. It's unfortunate how many chances this younger generation gets. As an alumnus who had to work hard to attend Cornell in the early 60's, I am deeply ashamed of what has become of my alma mater.
