I am still wondering why you stopped talking to me all of a sudden and act like I don't exist. I was nice to you the first day I met you out of courtesy, not thirst as you (I assume) think. Seriously there is no need to be rude, and if you have a problem just bring it, I don't mind critism in my life, especially when I am trying to discover myself. I hope that we can "repair" our "friendship" and just be friends, tho so far I see it unlikely and honestly you are acting like the stigmatized image of a sorority girl.
