Sometimes I hate being black. All the put downs and let downs kill me inside. Guy only see me as a one night stand so they can say they've been with a black girl. I feel so used. I'm just some ugly girl, used by horny boys who never want more than sex. I'm never their first choice. I feel like nothing.
