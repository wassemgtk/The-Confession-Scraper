On the outside, I appear like I'm happy and loving life, but on the inside, I'm really struggling. It takes so much of my energy to smile, laugh, be social, and go about life as usual. I've tried to open up to a few people I consider "close friends", but they've just brushed me off. Why can't I just say "I'm struggling" and have someone take me seriously? Do I need to break down and cry or do something close to suicidal? I'm trying to be strong but it's hard when there's no encouragement.
