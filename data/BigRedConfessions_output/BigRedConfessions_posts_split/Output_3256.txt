Do I believe in love?

How could I know? We'll never know if you and I see the same blues, reds, or greens. Maybe the love I see is just a little different than yours. Maybe I'm color blind and just don't know it. Perhaps I go through the motions just fine, without a second guess, until you mention the number on the card that I just can't seem to find. But I've seen that number before, other places; I know it exists, just not on that card, for me.

But if I squint my eyes, sometimes, I think I can see it. But is that just because you told me it was there?
