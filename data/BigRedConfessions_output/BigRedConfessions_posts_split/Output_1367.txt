I still wonder where we would be now if one of us had been ballsy enough to talk about it two years ago.  It's weird because I know it wouldn't have worked out long term but I still feel like I missed out on so much.  I wasn't sure what was going on and you were so sweet and smooth I got nervous, especially since it seemed so clear to me from the start that you were into her.  I miss what we could've had.  I wish you the best and know you'll go far.
