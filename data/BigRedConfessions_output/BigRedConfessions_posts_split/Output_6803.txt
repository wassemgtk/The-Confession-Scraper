When I came to Cornell, I was a healthy weight. But now, even though I still have a bit of pudge on my belly, I'm at a BMI of 15.7 and still dropping. I know that I'm underweight, and that my body image is severely distorted. But I'm afraid of seeing a doctor, because I don't want to be pulled out of university for something this trivial. My parents don't see any problems with my weight, and in fact, congratulated me when I told them my weight. I need help. What do I do?
