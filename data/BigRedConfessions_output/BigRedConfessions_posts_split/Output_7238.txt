There's this guy that I see often at the place my friend always does her school work, and at first I thought he was super funny looking, but after having encountered him a few times, I can't deny that he's piqued my curiosity... He's so weird, but in a good way... I can't figure him out and that just makes me want to get inside his head and explore the things that make him tick. Even the way he looks is starting to become exquisitely attractive.
