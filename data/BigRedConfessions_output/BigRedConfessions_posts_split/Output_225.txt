To the guy who posted about wanting sex to be something more meaningful, I completely agree with you. Don't get discouraged by hookup culture or drop your values to appease other people. I'm not super religious, but I also agree that sex should be with someone you care about. There are definitely girls on campus, like me, who also have the same mindset as you.
