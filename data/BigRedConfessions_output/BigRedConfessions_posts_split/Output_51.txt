Yes, I know that us students from low-income family qualify for more financial aid. Yes, I know that some of you don't qualify for aid at all and that you have to take out a massive amount of loan or your family has to pay it all. But please, please, don't call us who qualify for aid lucky. Especially us who qualify for full aid. It hurts more than you know. To not have access to healthcare, to have fallen off a high place on a school playground, injured your shoulder and unable to move your arm, and prayed that it is nothing serious and that you will not end up being permanently disabled. And I am not even one of the poorest here; I at least never had to worry about when will my next meal be. Imagine some people here who had days in which they had no roof over their head and no clue when they will have their next meal. Please be considerate when you call us lucky.
