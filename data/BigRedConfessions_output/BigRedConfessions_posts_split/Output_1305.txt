I'm terrified of how sad I can get at Cornell. It's my second year here, and I've noticed such sadness here, even if it isn't obvious. Before coming to Cornell, I'd never felt such hopelessness or despair for  my grades, my social life, my future. It's difficult for me to know that even thought I study and try my best, I'll still only be either average or a slight bit above in my classes. I try so hard to keep smiling every day, but it's just getting harder. Sometimes it feels like I'm losing control of my life and it terrifies me. Cornell is a beautiful place but it can be so ugly sometimes.
