Recently, my heart has been filled a ton of sadness. It just feels like a burden. I just want to cry and cry forever. But, I'm just going to put on the smiling mask and go out because no one cares about my problems. That's one thing this place has taught me: people have their own problems to deal with and don't want to deal with anyone else's. So, its just better to bury them. Hopefully, this doesn't hurt my health. Is this depression or me being a whiny bitch? Probably me being a bitch. Everything is just feels sad and mellow.
