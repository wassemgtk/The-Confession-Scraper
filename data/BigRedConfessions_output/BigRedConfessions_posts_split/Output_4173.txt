Everyone says that it everything is challenging here but, let's face it, would we 'fit' anywhere else? Also, on a total unrelated note, i met someone during the summer (who happened to go here yet transferred), he was amazing! We only saw each other a couple of times and i thought we really hit it off! As time passed, for some reason, he became very distant and did not respond to the last 2 messages that i sent. i really wish i could know what happened and why the sudden change? I always feels the urge to send another message but i always tell myself that the phone works both, and if he wanted to know about me, he would try to do so. He is on my mind a lot but time has definitely assisted to diminish the sadness that i felt at the beginning of school year.. All i can say is, hope you are well and I wish things would have turned out differently.. Wish ya the best.  A. H.
