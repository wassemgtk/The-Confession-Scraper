So much on my mind. I just want to be able to breath, and know that it will all work out. But right now, I feel almost numb, like I'm not fully aware what this process means, not fully aware that not getting into this professional program could mean the end of my hopes and dreams. I think if I don't get in, it will be the thing that finally causes me to shatter, and I'm not sure if there is anything that can put me back together.
