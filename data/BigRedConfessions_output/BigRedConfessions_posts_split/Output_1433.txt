Ever since I graduated Cornell I gained 20 pounds. I don't think a guy will ever date me now because I look ugly with the extra fat on my stomach. When I was at Cornell I couldn't afford the bus so I had to move my ass each morning to the Ag Quad. Now I just have a lazy office job where I don't move around a lot and take public transit to my job with no walking at all. At this rate I will become a diabetic or worse. At Cornell I ate ice cream everyday and lots of shit, but here I really have to start watching what I eat. I wish I took a more physical job rather than being a secretary all my life. It's such a boring and lazy job without much movement. :( I even get bullied by my mean co-workers and this had led me to start antidepressants which have also contributed to my weight gain. I feel as though its a never ending battle. I just want to be a student at Cornell again so I can shed the excess blubber.
