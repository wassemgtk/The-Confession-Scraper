I was extremely depressed second semester at cornell. I would cry almost every night and I didn't make as much friends as I had hoped. I'm home now and even though I'm still upset at not knowing what to do in my life while being in a long distance relationship...I'm not as depressed as I was in cornell. The way things go next semester will determine whether I stay or transfer but I feel I would be much happier in another institution. Sorry. I'll give it one more try though.
