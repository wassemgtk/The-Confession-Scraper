@#4742 on non-native English speakers: YES. You captured my feelings EXACTLY; thank you! I am tired of hearing American students make fun of their peers for their accents/pronunciation. 

English is my first language but I grew up in another part of the English-speaking world, and people here keep trying to correct/mock the way we say certain words. For instance, "homogeneous" (hi, MATH2930 classmates last semester) or "presentation"... ... Before you make fun of someone for not talking the same way you do, remember that i) your way may not be the only right way and ii) most people would fail horribly at getting a college education in a non-native tongue.

Do you know how to say "linearly independent" or "row equivalent" in your own second language? Yeah...now imagine taking every single class in a language you don't use at home. You think orgo is hard in English? Pssh. Have some respect for your classmates instead of sniggering when they open their mouths.
