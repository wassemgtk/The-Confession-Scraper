I don't generally go out of my way to look pretty for guys or make an effort to attract the attention of the opposite sex, but seriously, is there literally NO guy in my life who looks at me as anything other than a friend or an acquaintance?! I'm almost 19 and am 90% sure that no guy has ever considered dating me :|

[I'm 100% thankful you filled out the survey!]
