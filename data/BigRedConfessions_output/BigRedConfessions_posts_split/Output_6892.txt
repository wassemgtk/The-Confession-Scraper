Why do all the attractive guys have to have girlfriends.. I saw you at a mixer and you were controlling the music and seemed to have really good taste in music and seemed really intriguing but when I went up to you and tried to talk to you you slipped in that you had a girlfriend. First world problems, but still, a big one at that. At this point I'm just going to hope and pray that you're a regular at your mixers
