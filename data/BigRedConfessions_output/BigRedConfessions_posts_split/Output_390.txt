If you're still bitter about something that happened like a year ago, you need to move on. Stop wasting your time and energy towards something that's insignificant in the long run. It's a part of growing and maturing, realizing what is and isn't important. Don't let people affect the things that you do or don't like just because you didn't like the person or vice versa. Move on. Just move on.
