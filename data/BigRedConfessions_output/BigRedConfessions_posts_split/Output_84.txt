"Bystander, but couldn't help being bothered by what I heard and saw friday night. It was pretty late in Ctown and some asshole told a girl (who was his date?) to literally ""fuck off"" when she refused to go with him to a party or somewhere. Girl didn't even blink. She said ""fine. see ya!"" turned and just walked away alone. Honestly felt more sorry for the guy, he just stood there gaping. Huge respect for her, but actually though, what is it with guys getting pissed off when they don't get their way? No one should ever be pressured to do anything they're not comfortable with, and judging from his surprise just shows how entitled some dudes can be. hate how shit like this can happen, it's way too common nowadays"
