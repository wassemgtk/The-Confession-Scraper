My older brother and sister are fraternal twins. I know that they're committing incest, but I'm scared to confront them about it or tell my parents. Should I tell them to stop or should I bother tattling on them? I don't want to hurt them and I don't want to judge them. After all, they're entitled to love each other and have sex. But when it's not safe sex, there's a chance they'll give birth to a demonic bastard child and I'll be that thing's uncle. I know for a fact that they don't use condoms or any contraceptives. What do I do fellow Cornellians? What do I doooooo?
