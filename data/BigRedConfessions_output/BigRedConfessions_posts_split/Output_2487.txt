To a girl I know:

I first met you this year in the dorm and fell into a puppy love crush when I saw you. I had never been successful in getting girls, but you were a gem of beauty and grace that I had never seen before. You were spunky, energetic, and full of life. And yet, you were open to conversations with me. Your down-home attitude toward socialization made me feel that you were one of the special few at Cornell; the kind of person who doesn't care about someone's social status as long as they're a decent human being. I've found other girls at Cornell who I've loved and lost, and you've given me advice on them from time to time. 

Lately, I've noticed that my feelings for you haven't changed a bit. I think you're the most beautiful, sweet, and down-to-earth girl on campus. I've been itching to tell you how I feel, and I've danced around the subject. We've had conversations about relationships, how you perceive me, how others perceive me, and I realize that you've been one of the few people to not judge me. That hasn't affected anything I've done to/with you because I can dissociate my personal life and work life, but I really like you, and I want to spend more time with you. 

But my life experience has told me that real life isn't like what you see in the movies. The nerdy guy doesn't get to be with the beautiful cheerleader at the end of it all. The nerd goes back to do his work and maybe have sex once in his life, and the cheerleader gets to be with whomever she wants to, and the world doesn't take a second glance at the situation. Maybe it's the way the spirits of the universe intended for my life to go, but I refuse to believe that we don't have a shot together.

I can't get into a relationship with you for several reasons, but mostly because I just think it'll be impossible for someone as charming and beautiful as you to ever find it in your heart to like someone like me. There are other reasons we've discussed as well. In four years, we'll both have graduated, and we'll offer the world whatever we can do best. But, if you think you're the person I'm talking about, just slip a note underneath my door (anonymously) and just tell me if I'm in over my head, or if, perhaps, you like me back. We'll never have to talk about this again, and I'll pretend this never happened. But please help me bring closure to these feelings so I can get back to work.

And even if you're not the girl I'm talking about, slip a note under your guy friend's door and let him know how much he means to you. You'll make his month, I promise.
