My parents keep telling me that they're not going to pay for Cornell anymore because I'm not getting the grades they expect and participating in extracurriculars they don't approve of. I don't qualify for federal work study or anything like that so I'd have to somehow come up with the money myself. I don't know anything about students loans or interest rates. I've never held a job and don't have any job skills. I don't want to leave Cornell but I just don't know what to do.
