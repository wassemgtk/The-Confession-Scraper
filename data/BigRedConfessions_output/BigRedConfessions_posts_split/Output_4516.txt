Since I started Cornell last year I have suffered from depression and it has really elevated this year to the point where I dread waking because it means starting a brand new miserable, lonely day. My Mom suggests transferring but I think my problems will follow me wherever I go. I have no idea what I am doing and the pain is becoming unbearable. Does anybody who has dealt with depression have advice?
