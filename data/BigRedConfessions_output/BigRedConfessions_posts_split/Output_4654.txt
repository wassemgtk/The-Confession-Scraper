"How not to fail in a dining hall:
1. Don't set things on fire. This includes but is not limited to toasters, waffle irons, microwaves, and ice cream.
2. Don't steal things.
3. Don't be a dick when confronted about stealing things.
4. Don't be a dick generally.
5. Don't leave your cups and mugs everywhere. It's not supposed to be a screwed up Easter egg hunt for the workers.
6. Do take your stuff to the dish return.
7. Don't make out. The bread rack is not a proper place for PDA. Or the salad bar. Or the tables. Or anything even remotely horizontal.
8. Do ask if you need to know about allergens.
9. Do USE THE FUCKING TONGS.
10. Do tell a worker if you dump a plate on the floor. Or generally make a mess. The longer it sits, the bigger a pain in the ass it'll be.
11. Don't duck under the sneeze guards. They're called sneeze guards for a reason.
12. Do tell a worker if you see problems in the dining hall (soda is flat, milk isn't dispensing, melted ice cream mess, etc.)
13. Don't muck about with the soft serve machine. And put the handles back up when you're done.
14. Do sit with people you don't know. Great place to meet friends.
15. Do say please and thank you.
16. Do respect the tilted chair.
17. Do try new foods and eat your veggies.
18. Don't be a dick. It bears repeating.

Welcome to Cornell, class of 2018. Please don't burn my dining hall down.
