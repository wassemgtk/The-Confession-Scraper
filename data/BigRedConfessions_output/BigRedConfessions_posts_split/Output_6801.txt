"I'm Caucasian, and I feel incredibly oppressed by all these minorities-only programs, especially when it comes to research internships. I'm sorry I happen to come from a white-skinned family (and that that fact says absolutely nothing about who I am as a person), I'm sorry that I'm middle class and too ""well off"" to need financial aid but too poor to reasonably be able to afford coming here, I'm sorry I'm an immigrant but don't quite match your exact ""underrepresented"" stereotype, and I'm sorry that I just want to find a path for myself in life, too.
I can't help but be incredibly bitter and angry towards all of this. Just like minorities, I never did anything to deserve being who I am, culturally. So why discriminate against me while being so ""inclusive"" and supporting ""diversity""?"
