I couldn't get an erection while trying to hook up with a girl that I really like and she took it personally when in fact it had nothing to do with her. It's just that I've created such a high threshold of stimulus with my insane nonstop masturbating that real girls can't compete. Don't make that mistake guys, save your d***s for the real world. A human vagina is not your 10000 psi grip going up and down at 3000 rpm.
