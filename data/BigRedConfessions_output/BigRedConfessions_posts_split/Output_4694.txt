Last night after tapestry, I saw this cute bubbly Asian girl being harassed with racist jokes by this stick figure guy. I wasn't sure if I should've stepped in because she was laughing. Before I could say anything, a guy from my dorm asked if she was okay. She smiled and said that was her friend. The guy from my dorm ended up getting her name and knowing her. If only I stepped in and said something then that could've been me. Now, I'll never get to know her.
