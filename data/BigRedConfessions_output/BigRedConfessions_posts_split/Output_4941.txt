I once faced a similar problem when I was interning at a hospital. Every time she saw me, she gave me dirty looks and made snide comments when I past her but not about the other interns of the same race as her even though they didn't work as hard as I did. What worked was reporting the issue to my supervisor who later addressed her about her behavior. Though I received more angry looks after that, the important part is getting them to realize that those sort of actions are not tolerated. Next time it could be a patient and not you.
