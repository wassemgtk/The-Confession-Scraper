I am struggling more this year than I have any other, and I don't know if I will be able to turn it around.  The stress I feel just makes me want to lie down in the grass and disappear, or just run away from everything and never return.  I feel like I am a failure and that I am failing myself, my parents, and everyone else.  I suck at my major and its too late to change anything, and the only things I'm good at are impossible to make money at unless you are literally the best at it, which I'm definitely not.
I just wish my s/o could marry me after graduation.  I would make the best trophy partner- taking care of our home and kids and all of my s/o's needs, and I know they would be secure enough financially in the future to support myself and our children.  But alas, I'm pretty sure we are done by graduation.
Guess I better get my shit together and try to not suck at life so much.  Oh well.
