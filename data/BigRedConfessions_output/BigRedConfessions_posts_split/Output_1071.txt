Schuyler House is by far the most asocial and lonely place I have ever lived at. I have moved a lot in my life, lived in shared apartments and residences etc. and I am just so shocked by how cold people who live here are. People don't say Hi on Hallways, slam the doors even at night when it is obvious that others are sleeping, just make noise in general and worst of all, don't clean up after themselves. I'm just so happy when I finally get to move out of this place, it's not the facilities that make it so hard to feel at home here, it is the people. Ignorant, egoistic and careless. I tried to be nice to people in the beginning but I'm slowly giving up because it makes me feel even more lonely when friendliness is just not returned.
