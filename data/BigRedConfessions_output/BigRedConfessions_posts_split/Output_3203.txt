I wish there was a room I could go into and press a button and just be vaporized instantly without any trace. I would so do that. Just instantly broken up into atoms, totally untraceable. No pain, no remains, not even dust, just individual atoms that would bond, dissipate, etc. immediately. And no record of me going in or cameras. Just mysteriously gone forever. I think that solves all the problems with suicide. Because I don't wanna kill myself, I just want to disappear, i.e. cease to exist immediately in any non-fundamental form.
