I am so lonely here. I have friends my age that are married/engaged and it blows my mind because no one is even on my mind. All I really want is to love and be loved but that doesn't seem to be in my cards. I thought when I joined my sorority it would help my social status and while I've gotten great friends, still no romance. Technically I know I'm cute, but subjectively I don't know.
