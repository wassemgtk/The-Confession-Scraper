Life is a series of peaks and troughs. One day, I feel as though I have no friends and I'm a loner, and that my life is going to shreds. The next, I feel completely opposite. I'm not bipolar. I'm just living. And I need to know how this all works into my long term plans. As if they even matter.

Haven't you ever wanted to just travel the world? What if I could do that?
