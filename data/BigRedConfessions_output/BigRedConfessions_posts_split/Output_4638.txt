I hate the initial small talk from meeting people, which is a reason why this week has been so hard on me in terms of making friends and whatnot.
I want to know what makes people tick, that random boner that they got on their first day of co-ed gym class, weird shit about them from when they were 5, their innermost dreams, hopes & worst nightmares, and to have silence without it being awkward!!!... 
It's like my brain skips over that shit or something... I am also a one-on-one person so anything greater than one person at a time makes me almost silent in conversation
