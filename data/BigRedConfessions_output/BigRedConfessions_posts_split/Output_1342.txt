I find it extremely rude that people ignore my text messages or facebook messages. I personally always acknowledge the other person, even if I don't want to have a conversation. I wonder if the people who ignore my messages dislike me, and if they are being passive aggressive about. Smh, it is so hard to have a conversation on social media these days.
