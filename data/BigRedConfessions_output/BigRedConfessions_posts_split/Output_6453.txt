To the person who posted confession #1473: You're no one to judge whether you friend is "freaking out" over small things. Everything affects everyone differently and for you to say that your friend's problems are small is rude. You sound entitled and like an asshole. Maybe the fact that you're really NEVER there for them makes you a bad friend, and if your friend is really freaking out every day then you should realize that maybe they do have a big problem.

This person sounds better off without you, and just like you said they're not entitled to be reciprocated you're not entitled to have a good friend who's always there for you, so good luck dealing with your shit alone, prick.
