I love my girlfriend. Her smile brightens me up, the kind where I glimpse happiness in her eyes. I enjoy spending time with her the most and we always manage to have fun no matter how wrong our plans go. 
We can work to resolve the issues with grad school and your family standing in our way. Some people say we are perfect for each other, it's true!
