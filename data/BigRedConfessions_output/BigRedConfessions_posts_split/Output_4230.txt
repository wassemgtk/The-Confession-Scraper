This one time I went to a take-out restaurant in Ithaca and used my credit card. I frequent the place regularly. But occasionally there's this woman cashier who, after swiping the card and printing the receipt, puts my copy in her pocket, while taking the other one. This has only happened two or three times. But I can't help but wonder if she writes in an extra amount on both receipts after I leave. I always feel like hitting my head against the wall after realizing what's happened.
