I messed up. I really liked you as a person and when we got to hang out I would forget about everything and just enjoy your company. But I was holding back. I had my reservations about us not talking as much as I wanted to, but I was too scared to make the first move. I've dealt with a lot in my life, but having you disappear has made me very sad and disappointed in myself that I didn't trust and take a leap of faith. I wish I could see you again.
