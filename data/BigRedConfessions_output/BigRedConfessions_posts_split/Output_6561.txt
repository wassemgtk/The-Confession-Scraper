I'm done waiting for you to do something. I overanalyzed everything because I wanted to believe that you really did like me. After spending hours talking to my crying friend about her awful boyfriend, I  realized that you act just like him. I deserve better than that, and I finally feel like I can forget about you and stop being so stupid.
