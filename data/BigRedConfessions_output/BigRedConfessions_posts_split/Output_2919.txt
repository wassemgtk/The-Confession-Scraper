Just when I thought my depression and anxiety had gone better with the help with antidepressant, I had three panic attacks in a row in one night. I've had anxiety attacks but never had panic attacks before. I remembered I tried desperately to breathe only to hear the frantic beating of my heart. I was so convinced I would die right there. I'm too exhausted to fight all my intense mental shit.
