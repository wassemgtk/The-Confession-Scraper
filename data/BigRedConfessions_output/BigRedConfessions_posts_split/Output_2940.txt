I've been constantly missing morning classes/obligations due to an intense fear of recurring nightmares I've had ever since high school but have been returning more frequently lately

Every time I looked on that ledge a little too long, every time I cut a little (lot) too deep and every time I sat on the tracks watching trains pass all knight knowing I couldn't be seen and seriously (not a 'my life sucks right now understanding, but a mindset you come to after debating the same question in your mind for so long you know all the cracks and dominant paths the arguments will take) grappled with jumping in front of one.

Reliving it all only successful attempts. I don't think people understand how fucking hard it is to kill yourself. Even if you can take some action towards it, the instant before the 'final blow' you fall into the grip of this overwhelmingly sheer panic that subsumes everything else. Outside the dream thinking about the dream, I am always already before the panic but aware of it-- aware of this coming black wall of blind fear and deep anxiety. That's what I hate the most- always being before the panic is more unsettling than being in it because when you're in that place there is no other thoughts other than that claw in your stomach that you have to stop, run, hide, don't do that, put it down. In the dream, I'm already dead in a dozen different situations and places, wallowing in that void of panic

I hate/fear it so much. Every day I think I'm fine, but before I sleep that little slow pre-panic knot just unravels in my chest and I start sweating and get shaky. I can't go to sleep. I end up doing some (any) noncommittal task that will occupy me until morning- sometimes I just sit for 3-4 hours staring at the wall. Every other day or so this catches up with me- I'll stay up until I can't do it anymore and my body relaxes enough that I pass out (it's not like I don't have the same chance of having the dreams then- it's just that I can't stop myself from sleeping)

I don't know how to tell professors or friends or other people that I make arrangements with what's going in- why I'm always tired in class or missing them- why my sleep schedule is so erratic. I could go to a professional, but I'm poor as all hell and I can't risk family members finding out. I'm lost
