"I still look at your Instagram posts almost every day, just to see who continues associating himself/herself with you.  Most of your ""friends"" are some of the most fake people out there.

Real friends confront each other to resolve issues between them.  But thanks for hurting my feelings anyways, I'll probably never let anyone know I liked them that much, and appreciated their time, ever again.  I'll just shut my mouth about every thing else from now on."
