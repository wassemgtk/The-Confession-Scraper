If I came back from break with my nice new Canadian Goose (which I wouldn't in the first place cause of the animal cruelty involved), and so many other people were sporting that same corporate brand (do you own the brand or does your brand own you?), I'd tear that patch off in the interest of saving my individualism. And yes, I'm now judging each and every one of you on these points. Word up!
