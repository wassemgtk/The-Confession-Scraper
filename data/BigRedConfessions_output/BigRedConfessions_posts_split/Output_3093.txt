I can't tell if you know or not. The mixed signals I get from you push me away even more. I want to give up on the possibility of us, but it's hard because we've already come so far since last year....and to give all that away is heartbreaking. Sometimes I know that you try but I don't know what your real intentions are. Are you actually interested or are you just being nice/friendly? Seeing you laughing and chatting with your friends made me realize that I'm not special. You don't only joke around with me and you go out of your way to help everyone out...not just me. I was reading too much into it before. I would be honest with you but if you don't feel the same way, we will lose even the possibility of being friends and that's too big of a risk. At the same time I feel like we are just wasting time and just moving back and forth without going anywhere.
