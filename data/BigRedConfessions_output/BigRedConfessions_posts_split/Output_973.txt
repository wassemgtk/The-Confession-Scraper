I knew I had problems with masturbation. I was very addicted to it; I used to do it at least 3 times a day. I mean, what else could a closeted gay guy do? Being closeted is not a pleasant experience at all because I can't be who I want to be, or talk to guys in a public manner (just like I'd do with friends). It's simply hard!

I have had Grindr for a long time and it was hard for some time because I'd not send a picture because of the fear of being exposed or ""out-ed"". I had some encounters but not with the right people, and after having those encounters, I'd feel depressed because I'd regret them and then get back to a lot of masturbation. So I decided to start sharing my face on Grindr just to see if I could have more quality moments with other guys that would not normally respond because I didn't have a profile picture so I could stop masturbating so much.

And it did happen. I have met 2 really sweet guys (individually) in the past 2 weeks with whom I had a great experience and a connection with them I never had with anyone before. I have stayed away from masturbation ever since then because I actually fell in love with one of them. Yes. It was love at first sight. He's the ideal guy for me. He was sweet, caring, careful, very masculine, tall, mature, etc. But he's 29 and I'm barely 20, and to make it worse, I met him in a trip to NYC so we live in different places.

He was sweet, made me have a great time when I visited him and has had me thinking about him the entire week. He didn't log into Grindr for 5 days!!! I was going crazy. I couldn't focus during my classes for the entire week because I just kept daydreaming and remembering all of his words, his voice, etc. I needed to tell him how I felt about him and that I wanted to see him again and so I did when he logged in again on 11/29 and he told me that was really sweet. He said that if I lived in nyc we could get to know each other better and talk but I am sure that the age difference prevents him from feeling the same about me. Like, he's a stable person, even with a PhD, and I'm barely a junior in college.

So here goes my hopes of falling in love for a long time. I know too much happened in my head in only one week but I never felt like this about anyone, not even about the previous girlfriends I had before admitting to myself I had a thing for men. Now, I'm really sad and not sure how I will deal with the next 2 weeks of the semester left and get back to nyc knowing nothing will happen between us. 

P.S. I also don't have the energy to masturbate. So I guess this situation will help me stay away from it for a looooong time.
