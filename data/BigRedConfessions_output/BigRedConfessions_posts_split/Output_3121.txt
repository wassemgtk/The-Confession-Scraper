I hate my body when I'm near people. When I look into the mirror I feel fine. When I can't see myself, I feel amazing. But when I go party and see myself in pictures with my friends, I feel huge. I wish I could just look like my friends but at the same time I know that my weight has made me who I am and I love who I am. So I both hate and love my body, and I'm perfectly okay with that. :)
