Thank you Google Chrome for displaying frequented sites on your new tab page and for not offering an option to disable that functionality. For half a second, a class of 30 people could see that I'd been to a porn site recently. It was a pretty small icon and thankfully not graphic (just a logo), and for a very short duration, but if I knew that even if ONE of those 30 people noticed I'd sink into the Earth. Thankfully I didn't realize it'd happened until later.
