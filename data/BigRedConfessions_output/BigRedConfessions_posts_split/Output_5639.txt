I'm someone who isn't really on either side of the political spectrum, but I find myself being driven to the left simply because politicians on the right are so damn offensive!  Can anyone tell me what it is that makes extreme rightists sound so much more ignorant and awful that extreme leftists?  It's like I can't even turn around without another news headline about some awful thing a member of the GOP said about women/homosexuals/etc.
