You are a terrible human being. How you can be so rude and insensitive after I've been so nice to you. But its not your fault, because you didn't ask me to be nice, right? Maybe. You could care less about me, but I still cannot find enough evil and revenge in my soul to treat you the same way. FYI: You're not that good..
