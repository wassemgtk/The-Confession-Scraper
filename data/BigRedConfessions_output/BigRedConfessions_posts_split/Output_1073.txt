What is the problem with guys! Like seriously, how do we girls even know if a guy is into us or not? For all the "women are effing complicated", men are even worse. I mean, one week we are kissing on a street, two weeks later making out in his apartment, then no texts for a week? Days of silence followed by a one day of texting? First he says stuff like, "I need an excuse to see you" or "We should meet up" or "Are you around and free right now" but when I say let's get coffee, then he doesn't have time? I'm pretty sure it's not just a booty call, cos in that case he wouldn't have asked me to see him in a public place. But what is it? It's been almost two months and I am sick and tired of this hot n' cold routine. The past four years have not exactly been idyllic years of singlehood and all I want is spend some time with the guy I like. Nothing scary or serious! Just some coffee, just some holding hands and some conversation. Am I asking for too much? Am I being some "crazy" woman here? Ugh, I wish I knew what was going on in his head. Or I wish I had the guts to just ask him outright :-(
