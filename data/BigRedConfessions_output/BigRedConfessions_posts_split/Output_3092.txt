As a senior, I'm a little sad that I've started to drift away from my fraternity brothers. They've been, and still are, some of my closest friends at Cornell. At the same time, it's kinda relieving too. The new leadership is questionable, with our rush chair bring a sophomore with almost no experience and our leaders making questionable decisions. The brothers are getting apathetic, and the events just aren't fun anymore. Maybe it's just me, or maybe it's senior year, but I just don't feel that connection anymore.
