"Its funny to me how maybe only 4 girls paid attention to me at Cornell because I was not in a Frat but now that I have graduated, its so easy! (and I know I'm not the one thats changed) 

Honestly, it never bothered me because I was a grad student and not 19 but people need to realize that Cornell is in a bubble. Wait till you get into the real world "
