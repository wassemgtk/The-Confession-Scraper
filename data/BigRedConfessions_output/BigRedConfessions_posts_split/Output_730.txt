Even if I'm the only one at Cornell, which I know I am not though since I know people who are quite conservative here, I'm voting Donald J. Trump for President of the United States of America because my extremely liberal ex-friend hates him and I know that by voting for him I will be sending them a message that talk show host Michael Savage was right and his NY Times best seller book is the basis of Donald's Presidency. Both of them tell it like it is and we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN and fix all the issues from the past rogue presidency.
