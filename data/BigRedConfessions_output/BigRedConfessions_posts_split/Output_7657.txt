There was a girl crying in Olin today. I asked you if you were okay, and offered to buy you something, but you insisted that you were fine. I could clearly tell from your face that you weren't fine, but I didn't want to press you because I knew I wouldn't want to be pressured into talking, especially with some rando who just happened to be sitting across from me in the library. Whatever happened to make you cry so hard and look so sad, I hope it gets fixed and that you feel better!
