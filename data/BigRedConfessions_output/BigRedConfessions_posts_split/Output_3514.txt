I'm sorry for how things ended. I'm warm towards everyone - genuinely so - but the moment I feel that real spark, I cannot help but recoil; it's defensive, I don't want to get hurt. I'm acceptant of things now, talking to other people and such, as I imagine you are too. I go to bed, content, thinking I've moved on, only to awaken from a dream visited by you and you alone. I wish this feeling would dissolve. But I more so wish that we were together, xoxo
