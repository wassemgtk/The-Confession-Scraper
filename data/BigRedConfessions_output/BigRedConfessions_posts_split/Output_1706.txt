I am terrified that I am this close to losing my shit. I thought graduation would improve things because I wasn't happy at Cornell even though I so desperately wanted to be. But things just seem to be getting worse and worse: every party now involves me drinking till I black out and making out with anything and everything that would have me. If I could kill myself, I would, but I am terrified of failing in an attempt to die and the pain that would involve. I feel like there are so many things swimming in my head and no way to sort through all of this. I have a thousand plans and thousand lists of things to do, but I never get them done. And now, for all practical purposes, I am alone because I don't want to be a burden on my friends anymore, and it scares the crap out of me! :-(
