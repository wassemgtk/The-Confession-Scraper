Seeing all these freshmen giving confessions about their low pre-med GPAs reminds me of when I was a freshman. I didn't come to Cornell for the name; I mainly did for the financial aid, and I ended up loving the campus and friends. So even though I have a terrible GPA that will never recover from my first few semesters, I would still have chosen Cornell if I had to choose again.
