I just feel like I'm continually fucking up this semester. I'm getting legitimately bad grades on prelims for the first time in my life despite trying fairly hard. I haven't managed to get a summer internship yet despite getting one last year with less hassle. My personal life is practically nonexistent. This is all making me value my friendships and the little things more, but I want things to go back to normal. I think other people are catching on and are surprised that things aren't totally working out for me, and it makes me feel like a disappointment or like they must think I'm lazy. In reality I'm just burned out and trying to do as well as I can.
