i feel like the white people here get really touchy when people talk to them about privilege or about how racist institutions still hurt people of color to this day. it seems like its a massive fight just to get people to realize that racism is still a problem and that yes, they personally are contributing to it by supporting systems of racial power either tacitly or overtly. instead, white people take any sort of attempt to confront or educate them on this as an unfair attack on them, they think theyre the ones being discriminated against and they throw around terms like politically correct and social justice warrior to delegitimize any criticism. So fuck it. I give up. I reject Dr. King's dream. I no longer give a shit about racial harmony, i just want whats mine, cuz we've had 400 years to work this getting along shit out and its clearly not working. so im just gonna work hard and get whatever money and power i can take because guess what white america? I dont need you to like me, at this point i don't even want you to like me. everything you have you built on the backs of exploited people of color and bitch i want whats mine and im taking it by any means necessary.
