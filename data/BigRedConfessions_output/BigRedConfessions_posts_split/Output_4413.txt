It literally turns me inside out how many people have blocked me. I get it, I had a shitty childhood, so I don't know how to not be annoying or too attached. All I do is bother people that don't want anything to do with me. Like, what happens now? Do I press forward and ignore these people, or am I supposed to fizzle out of of memory and go die in a corner? It's so fucking frustrating because people suddenly give a damn about victims of abuse and neglect, but God forbid you have one right in front of you, trying to work through said damage with you. With the thousands of people that are here, it's disgusting how little room there is for real healing. Even mroe so how Cornell can throw God knows how much money into a publicity stunt 5 miles away and shortens our school year every year. It's like they WANT people to jump; but then again, not on campus. They'd rather you kill yourself in the comfort, privacy, and liability of your own home. 

And before you copy-paste "go to CAPS and EARS," CAPS psychs tell me "idk" and "stop trying to be happy; just stop being suicidal" and EARS peeps gossip about your problems.
