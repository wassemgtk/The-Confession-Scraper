Until recently my life was truly miserable. I had to cope with several problems. My gf had a very tough illness and the doctors did not know how to cure it. During the time that she was in hospital my grandparents and my uncle passed away. My life really sucked. Every morning that I woke up I wished the day would finish sooner so that I could again go to sleep and forget about my painful problems. After those sad years my gf is stable again and my life looks balanced now. I can enjoy the sunshine again and laugh to the people around me. I have started to have a pleasant time in my life. I know that there is no way to escape the bad events in any life, but I hope at least the serial events of bad things in life had a 'pause' button, I could press that button and enjoy my current life a little more before the next bad thing...
