You said rude things about me that weren't true and you spread them to everyone just to embarrass me, all because I just didn't have romantic feelings for you. Then I transferred here and beat you at everything you were good at just to remind you that you lying and trying to bring some else down will always make you second best. Enjoy your shitty internship because your first choice took me over you. Haters gonna hate, potatoes gonna potate.
