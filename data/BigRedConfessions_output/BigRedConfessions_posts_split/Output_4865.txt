"In the light of Robin Williams' death, I'd like to share my views on suicide here - if it's not an appropriate outlet feel free not to post it admins, I'll completely understand.

It's good that this is anonymous, because in real life I'd be weary of sharing this as there is a stigma associated with holding any views on suicide other than the default ""it's a horrible tragedy"" one. But it's how I feel, maybe some of you will agree.

I find it incredibly hypocritical for people to readily judge the most important decision in a person's life, a decision that is usually informed to a very high degree by factors no one but that person is privy to. I think we should respect a person's decision to commit suicide instead of immediately jumping to the conclusion it was a result of mental illness, insanity, etc.

The reason I find it so offensive is because this is the ONE thing you have true control over in life. The one thing no one can take away from you regardless of what political regime you live under, what other circumstances are at play, the one freedom that doesn't extend to someone else's. And what you're essentially doing when you voice your opinion that it was a tragedy fueled by insanity or mental illness (even if you don't call it that) is take away that last vestige of control someone had over their life, which is their last vestige of dignity.

No one chose to be alive and experiencing reality is the most subjective thing ever, so for you to say - how could we have prevented this tragedy is to me offensive to human intelligence. Suicide is not some insane decision, it's usually the result of long and careful deliberation - everyone has a strong self-preservation instinct that has deep evolutionary roots. Rarely is it done on a whim. It's incredibly hard to do as you all know -- no matter how incredibly depressed or suicidal you are, you very quickly dissuade yourself from actually going through with it it. When the decision is made in a healthy brain, it's the result of existence having reached an unbearable state.

I'm not saying celebrate the fact the person finally got out either. I'm just saying celebrate their life and respect their decision to end it. Maybe it's because I'm not burdening my reasoning with religious nonsense, which treats human life non-logically, but from a scientific perspective you are in no position to judge someone's brain. Sometimes suicide IS the result of mental illness (which includes the vast majority instances when it's done impulsively) when the person has a damaged brain. That was not the case with Robin Williams. It was a conscious decision that was made when he considered all the information and I respect it. And it doesn't prevent me from celebrating his life and contributions nor does it prevent me from missing him and feeling sad.

Some people are just miserable their entire lives regardless of social life, success, money, relationships etc. Especially intelligent people as they are capable of a wider range of experiences. At some point suffering becomes too much, especially when it's augmented by aging. How incredibly selfish of you to say that just because YOU will miss them or because YOU wouldn't make the same decision because YOUR life plays out differently in your head and YOU're happy for purely neurological reasons, because their death affects YOU negatively, then everyone should reason the same way as you and act in accordance with your well-being. Why don't you mind your own business and let people make their own decisions."
