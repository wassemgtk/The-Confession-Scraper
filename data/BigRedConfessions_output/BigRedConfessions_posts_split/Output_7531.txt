I'm afraid to speak to Gannett about my mental health because I know what they do to people like me. Cornell will send you off in a heartbeat if they think you're a danger to yourself. Instead of giving you help, they give you the finger. Cornell may be the cause of depression, but if you harm yourself away from school, there's no blood on their hands. Don't believe me? Ask any of your friends on a "Mental Health Leave."
