I'm a conservative lesbian who is also pro-2nd Amendment, but I have no friends on campus as I feel my beliefs conflict each other and it's hard to meet people who share the same beliefs. Imagine visiting the LGBT resource center on campus and saying that you're conservative and like guns. They will immediately call you the devil and ostracize you. Luckily, back home I am a member of the Pink Pistols, a conservative LGBT gun owner community where I feel welcome for my beliefs and we have frequent outings with like minded friends, so I never feel as lonely as I do on this campus. I actually don't support marriage of non-heterosexual couples and this causes people to snap, even people who are not in the LGBT community. I prefer domestic partnerships for non-heterosexual couples, because I still believe marriage is a sacred institute to create children for the future wellbeing of a country and obviously LGBT couples can't have children!
