Sometimes I feel like I don't belong here. Everyone around me just seems so much smarter than me. All of my friends get A's and B+'s in their classes while I'm over here like uhh... Literally I could have gone to any other school and probably get a 3.7-4.0 GPA. But I chose here because of the name and its reputation and now my GPA suffers badly. I want to be pre-med but with these grades I don't think I have a chance.
