"I made an account on Friendsy to see what the new app was like, and I (a male) was confused and overwhelmed by number of freshman and sophomore girls here at Cornell (over two dozen) who kept hinting that they wanted to be “friends” with me over the course of a week. I didn’t think it had anything to do with whether or not I’m attractive: I’m average looking, but I did indicate on my profile that I was gay. I removed any mention of my sexuality from my profile, and in the last week I haven’t had a single girl send me a hint that she wants to be my “friend.”

First, I want to say that I hope the following rant doesn’t apply to at least a few of those girls. 

But I am not anyone's “Gay Best Friend,” nor am I anyone’s “GBF.” I don’t want to go shopping with you, I don’t want to gossip about boys with you, I don’t want to teach you how to better accessorize. I’m not a stereotype: I don’t dress well, I don’t have a “gay” voice, most people don’t consider me “feminine.” That shouldn’t matter.

I’m not a box to check on your list of “friends;” I’m not an accessory, I’m not a trophy, I’m not a box to check on your list of “friends.” I’m not an object. 

I’m a human being. I’m also human being who just happens to be gay. And when I make friends, I don’t go out of my way to have a black friend, or an asian friend, or an international friend, or a smart friend, or a stupid friend, or a rich friend or a poor friend. I just want a friend.

I sincerely hope you do as well."
