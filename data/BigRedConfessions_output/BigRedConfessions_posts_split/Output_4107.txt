I've now gone on a few dates and I have no prior experience dating. I noticed a pattern on dates that went well, and I want to consult the Cornell dating community on this issue. This has happened to me 3 times now - after the date, right as we're waiting to cross the street or for some other reason standing next to each other she'll sort of bring her head back a little and look at me for a few seconds, usually her eyes would get bigger. I mean not really lean in, but it feels like she's stepping on her toes and bringing herself closer, but trying not to do it too visibly. I don't know if that means she expects me to kiss her. It could be just my imagination and she's simply looking at me as we're talking. But I did notice it all 3 times and it only lasted a few seconds. I think a kiss is more of a second date thing, so I don't want to make a mistake, but does that sound like something girls do? I am really new to dating, so any advice is appreciated.
