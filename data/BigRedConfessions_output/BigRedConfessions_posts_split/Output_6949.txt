If I could redo freshman year knowing everything that I know now, I would get a single. If you're one of the lucky ones who get along really well with your roommate, congrats. If you're in the same situation as me, where you can't stand to even be in the same room as your roommate, there's barely a month left of class. So to all of us with shitty luck, hang in there, next year can only get better!
