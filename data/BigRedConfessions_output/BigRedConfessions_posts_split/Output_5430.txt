I'm really sad I don't have a close guy best friend. Every time I think I could have one, they are interested in more than just friendship. And when I tell them I'm not interested in them like that, they stop texting back, even though they seem like genuinely nice guys. 
I just want a friend who I can curl up and cry on when I'm sad. Someone who had help me feel safe. But will also be so dumb and just lounge around and make jokes. Like a big brother or something. 
I just can't seem to find one. :/
