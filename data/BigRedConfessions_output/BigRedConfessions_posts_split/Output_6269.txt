Today reminds me of the Cornell I fell in love with when I visited junior year of HS.  The beautiful campus, the busy bodies getting to class, people playing frisbee on the quad.  It reminds me that, yes, this school is HARD, but we still find a way to push through, enjoy our time here, and spend time with the people we've come to know as family.
