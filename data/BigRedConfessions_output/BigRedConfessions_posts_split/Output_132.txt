"Have you ever heard of misophonia? I wonder how common it is. I identify with this minor disorder, known as ""sound-rage,"" pretty strongly. Small sounds that I should be able to ignore or tune out send me into a rage. It makes me want to cry. It makes me want to scream. My roommate, sitting across from me, making all these interesting noises while she eats, is driving me completely insane. It makes me temporarily hate her. The guy sitting behind me in the library, sucking in air with every bite of food, can go die. It feels so stupid and crazy, but it is what it is. 

I hear that in some places, like Japan, it's pretty normal and encouraged to eat loudly. I wonder if there are people with this disorder in these places, and I wonder how they deal with it. "
