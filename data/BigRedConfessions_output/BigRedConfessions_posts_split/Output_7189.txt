"To be honest I am scared and I am sad. But that's kind of how life is, isn't it? It does the unexpected and you just have to cope with it. Take what you have and run with it. Run, run, run and don't linger on what's behind you. 

Thank you for giving me strength. And now I give to you this strength: Keep pushing onward! You only have this life, so savor every minute of it.
