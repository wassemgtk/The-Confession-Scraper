I find it sooo seductive when guys stop and hold a conversation with me even when other people or life in general says to just say hi and move on.  The conversation can be about classes or nothing really at all, but just the fact that you stopped makes me feel so special.  Tbh, sometimes I catch myself thinking "why are you doing this if you're not into me, just stop it, it's confusing," but then I realize that I'm grateful that they're at least good friends, even if they won't be anything more. But it still hurts a little bit knowing that you won't be anything more...
