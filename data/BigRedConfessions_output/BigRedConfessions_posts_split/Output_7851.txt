I liked a guy a lot, so I let him have very rough sex with me. I wanted to please him and I thought it was something that I wanted to try as well. He ended up slapping me in the face a lot, almost to a point where I felt afraid. I still really liked him even after that experience, but he ended up rejecting me a little while after. Now I feel extremely violated by how he treated me.
