Lately, I have been feeling very lonely. Over the break I lost my girlfriend of 10 years. I have no friends really since I often video chatted with my gf during my free time rather than spend time with friends at Cornell or join clubs. I am graduating at the end of the semester so I don't see a point to find friends here since I am so disconnected with the social environment here. I find myself drinking Peachka vodka shots before I go to bed every night and listening to Cyndi Lauper's "Time After Time" thinking about the great times I have had with my gf. We used to watch 80's movies together and now all I have is my lonely self. I wish I were more social in the past. We are both loners walking the earth. I hope she realizes he loneliness she will have in her heart now that we had an argument.
