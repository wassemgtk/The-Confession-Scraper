So I'm pretty sure that I'm not going to feel what I felt for you for anyone else.  (Maybe it's because now I'm looking for that?)  But other guys can distract me for a while.  But then I go back to missing you.  I just have to throw myself into life and find other ways to make myself, I guess.  My friends don't understand.  Mostly because they aren't me and they've never had something like we did.  I'll live.  It's just going to be hard.  I miss you.  Almost a year later I still miss you.
