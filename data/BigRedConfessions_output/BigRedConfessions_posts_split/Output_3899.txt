You know what always kills me about a guy?  When he has nice forearms (you can see the strength and vitality of them) and on top of that wears a nice watch (don't mean an expensive one but I mean not a strappy plastic Happy Meal type shit) that accentuates his forearms.  Ugh... so delirious right now.
