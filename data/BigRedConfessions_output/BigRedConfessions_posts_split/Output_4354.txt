Sometimes I think I'm never going to find anyone who's even remotely attracted to me, let alone who'll love me (romantically, eros, whatever you want to call it). My friends might tell me I'm pretty, but it's hard to believe that when I can't remember the last time a guy even gave me a second look. And, honestly, I really don't care if this post gets shit for being completely self-pitying, because I know it is, and I feel I can indulge in it for the time it takes to write this confession when I'm tired and working late yet again.
