I've been depressed for three years. It all started back in 2012 when I was on the basketball team. We had just won our regional championship, but our opponents wouldn't have it. After the game, they came to the locker room and started up trouble, beating our entire team with their fists. My friend took the biggest hits, and still has the scars on his face to prove it. That fight changed me. I stopped eating, I couldn't sleep, and I couldn't get myself up in the morning. After a few months, my mom sent me to her wealthy brother's house across the country. She hoped that maybe I'd get back to the happy and friendly person I'd been in the past, but it didn't work. I'm an Ivy League student who can't get themselves out of the bed in the morning, all because of a single fight.
