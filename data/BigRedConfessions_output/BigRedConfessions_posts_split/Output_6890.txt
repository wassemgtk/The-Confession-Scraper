It kills me when I see you. I want you. I want you to talk to me.  I want to be able to talk to you, just like we use to.  I've figured out how much you really meant to me, but now that I can't even get you to respond, it bothers me so much.  I regret being selfish and vulnerable. I'm so sorry but I just wish you would at least give me the chance to tell you that.
