"“If you want to control someone, all you have to do is to make them feel afraid.” -Paulo Coelho

You do not control me. You do not own me. The day I choose not to attend class, go to a party, or take a walk by myself because I am scared you will find me is the day you win. I am damn competitive and you had better believe I will NEVER let you win this game. Nice try. "
