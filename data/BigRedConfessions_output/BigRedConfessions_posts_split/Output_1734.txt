I really hope you don't actually hate me. I only stopped talking to you in all but a wistful way because I had liked you a lot for many months but never felt good enough for you; I never told you how I felt. Suffice it to say you made me feel amazing whenever we hung out together and I really miss how you made me felt, and I miss you. I tried my best to hide my feelings for you but I realized it would probably be healthier to just distance myself from you. I'm sorry but I hope you understand. You'll make some guy very happy one day.
