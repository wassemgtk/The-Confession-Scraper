I saw one of the people at the counter of a dining hall let this guy in for free after he realized he didn't have a meal swipe left. It brightened up my day so much!! She turned to me and said "I know I'm not supposed to do that" as she swiped me in and I just smiled. I had been having a pretty awful week with prelims and work and social drama but that moment just made it so much better. Thank you so, so much. You reminded me how much good there is in the world.
