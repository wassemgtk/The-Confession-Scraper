What exactly is an "old soul?" Why does everyone say it? I like to have sex and I"m sexually active. Does that mean I'm not an old soul? Wait! But I like to netflix and actually chill too! And I like discussing philosophical theories and politics. I usually prefer reading over partying. No? Still not an old soul?

I can't help think that people who call themselves old souls as pious. That they think they are somewhat better than those who frequently hook up. The truth is, we're all just trying to figure out what we truly want. Some people just want more sex. But they could also want intimacy. The term "old soul" creates an "us vs them" attitude when in reality, people more or less want the same things. It's not that you're either into hook up culture or you're an old soul. So can we stop distinguishing the two?
