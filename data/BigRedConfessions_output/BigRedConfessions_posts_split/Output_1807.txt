I am an international student just out of grad school; I got a job at one of those brand-name tech firms but I am still not able to work due to a delay on my work authorization paperwork. Americans don’t even know what kind of stuff we face.  We get into Cornell, get the job and still have to go through all the paperwork. The delay is very stressful. I’m running out of money and I’ll have to start paying back the student loan soon. 
It really sucks. I finally got my tax returns from the summer internship and it gave me a few more weeks to survive. I call USCIS (immigration services) and they are not very warm in saying that there is nothing they can do about it.

Here is the timeline if anyone is interested.

Jul/2014: Got returning offer from the summer
Oct/2014: Got offer from another firm, accepted. Start date: JULY 2015
Mar/2015: applied for OPT (recent grad work authorization)
May/2015: graduated! Yay!
Jul/2015: OPT rejected (I-20 document is 31 days old. Maximum limit is 30 days - the letter arrived on the 30th day)
Jul/2015: Reapplied
Jul/2015: Start date postponed
Aug/2015: OPT accepted YAY. Initial estimate to authorization arrive: 7-10 days

It has been 20 days so far and nothing. I tried to call the government agency (USCIS) and they told me to wait up to 60 days. Wait, what? 
I try to stay positive and love people, forgive these bureaucratic people…
