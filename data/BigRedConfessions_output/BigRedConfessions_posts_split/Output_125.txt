Are there actually college guys who don't sleep around? I get it. I really enjoy sex but I prefer it in a monogamous relationship. I think it's kinda gross when a guy has sex with multiple girls consistently. There are guys I know who've hooked up with a bunch of girls in my sorority and i think that's super weird and honestly kind of dangerous in terms of STDs. Sex seems so much better when you care about the person and when you feel comfortable with them. I don't mean to place judgement, but I want to know when I have sex with a guy that he's not just fucking every person with a vagina. And honestly I'm sick of the objectification and entitlement when it comes to sex here on campus. Maybe I just dont know where to find people who feel the same way (besides I guess church) or maybe they dont exist. Are there any guys who feel similarly to how I feel or am I just completely old fashioned?
