My best friend from home doesn't like to be in relationships where there is any sort of attachment. He practices self sufficiency, and thinks every should too. He's loving and sweet, and was always there to listen to me when I needed him, but today he told me he can't be friends with me for a while because he's grown attached to me. Our relationship has been become codependent. It’s no longer productive. We were never dating, but I feel like he just broke up with me. He was the person I was the closest to and now I don't feel like I have many close friends at Cornell to turn to. I guess what I’m suppose to learn from this is that I don’t need to have a best friend. Ultimately I’m my own best friend.
