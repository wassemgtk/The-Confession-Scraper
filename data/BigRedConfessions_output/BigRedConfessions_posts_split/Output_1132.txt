I want to get my work done but these recent discussions about racism make me feel all the feels. Like how it took me ten years to finally start loving my skin color after all the children in my white suburb would call me "poop" and "stinky". Like how I would come home and try to bleach my skin lighter. I don't know if I'll ever get over these issues & seeing the same white faces with the same smirking, eye rolling and apathetic behaviors just reminds me of childhood.
