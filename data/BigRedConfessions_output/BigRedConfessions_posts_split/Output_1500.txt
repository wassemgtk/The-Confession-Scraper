I can't wait to finish and graduate from Cornell in December and move back to Pennsylvania. I like PA better than NY because the state's taxes are lower (both state sales and income) and the state has lower prices on products than NYS because of lower regulations. So what if my electricity comes from coal, nuclear, and natural gas or that my furnace burns oil? At least it's more reliable and less expensive than NYS's electric grid. Global warming is a hoax anyways. I also can conceal carry back in PA and live free, knowing other people are possibly armed too and it makes me feel safe if some mentally-ill nut job decides to shoot up a place I visit. Oh I miss Pennsylvania for it's beautiful farms. Plus they have Allentown and a lot of beautiful rust belt cities where I love exploring, while Ithaca on the other hand along with a lot of upstate is boring as FUCK. I also have my car in PA unlike Ithaca's expensive parking (and few parking lots) and can drive my '99 Jeep or '01 Suburban without worries of offending any hippies or hipsters. I don't have to ride the smelly TCAT buses. I can also visit the shooting range in PA and hone my target skills. PA is THE BEST!
