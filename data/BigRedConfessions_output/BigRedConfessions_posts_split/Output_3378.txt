I love my girl friend. She's gorgeous and smart. 
I honestly don't think that I could survive the last semester without her.
Whenever I need someone, she's there and gives me the best hug ever.
Right now she's sitting in front of me at a dorm lounge solving math problems, and I'm trying to do my physics problem set.
There's no way I can fully concentrate though. She's just too attractive.
