Before I submit this, I should say that I don't go to Cornell anymore. I've transferred as a way to escape my past and start a fresh life. My life was hell. From the outside I seemed fine, but inside I was at a place that not many people understand. In the spring semester I attempted suicide twice. I'm not writing this so that you feel bad for me. I'm writing this so that you understand that I'm alive. 

I was in a deep, dark depression, one that I thought that I could never escape. Yeah, I occasionally still have relapses, but that's just like anything. I did, however, escape, and I found a new purpose in life. I'm not a religious person, and don't necessarily believe in a higher power, but I do believe in purpose. Last night, in my new life far, far away from Ithaca, I talked a kid down from suicide. You have no idea how much this one single moment justified all the hell I experienced. Every night crying into my pillows, feeling the self pity of not being good enough, watching my life crumble before my eyes; all of that suddenly became worth it for this one kid. If I didn't go through hell and back, maybe he wouldn't be here today. That makes it all worthwhile.

I'm telling you this because somewhere at Cornell, right now, there is someone like the old me, considering or attempting suicide. You can beat it and find your purpose in life, too.
