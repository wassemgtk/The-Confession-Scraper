I love this beautiful country. I love the military, the police, the church, and the ROTC program at Cornell. Cornell was founded by a conservative who loved America named Ezra Cornell. He was a farmer and a very smart businessman who developed a way to trench telegraph cables under the ground and created Western Union, a beautiful corporation. This was the predecessor to our telephone system. Bernie Sanders would try to undermine capitalism and destroy the beautiful institutions such as McDonald's and Walmart, which have provided jobs to many and made this country great. I cannot wait for this country to become more patriotic and so that we could become the best country in the world. We can build a wall to protect our integrity and manufacture most of our goods in the USA with regard to quality. I love this country so much that I have several flags flying in my front yard and I always buy everything that is Made in the good ol' USA because it will make my beautiful country even greater. We cannot afford to be sending anymore money overseas to countries that are dangerous and building up their militaries agains the United States.
