It is so exhilarating when a cute guy walking by on campus gives me a smile. Wouldn't it be amazing if every time you saw someone you thought was cute, you smiled at them and if they also thought you were cute, they'd smile back and then you guys would take that as a cue to stop and say hi, introduce one another and then go for coffee or something?! UGH IF ONLY THINGS WERE SO SIMPLE. THIS SHOULD BE THE NEW THING. YES??
