It's been a year, but it still bothers me to this day. Some friends and I were walking in ctown and I overheard a bunch of sorority girls refer to us as "those Asians." We were all born & raised in the US and we're friends with all types of people, but it just so happened that our group at that moment consisted of one racial sector (not even of the same ethnicity). It still upsets me that we were categorized and judged so quickly. After that incident, I began to notice more and more micro-aggressions and generalizations happening on this campus against all sorts of people. I'd never experienced something like that before coming here. I hate being seen as just "another one."
