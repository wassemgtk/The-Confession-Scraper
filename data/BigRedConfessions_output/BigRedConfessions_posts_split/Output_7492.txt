"Today we talked for the first time in months after breaking up over a year ago.  I was stupid, immature, and put you through one hell of an emotional gauntlet, and I regret my actions every day.  Your patience, sweetness, and grace have stood out even moreso in the fiasco following our break-up, and now I truly understand what a beautiful person you are, and I hate myself more than ever for what I did.  I never knew I could treat another person so cruelly.  I do not understand how you have forgiven me, and now--over a year after we broke up--I can truly say I love you.

If you can ever trust me again and would like to try again, you should know that I want that more than anything. I'm a different person from a year ago; I've really worked on the flaws that proved so damaging to our relationship and have matured in ten thousand different ways.  But most importantly, I've finally begun to appreciate what I took for granted for so long.  I love you; please, please, please tell me you want to try again."
