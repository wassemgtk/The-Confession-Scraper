Not being around you, makes me realize I don't need you. You're unsupportive and condescending, and it has been leeching the radiance from my soul these past years.  I wish you all the best, and I know you'll go far in your career, because work is all you seem to care about. More importantly, congratulations on being my only regret. You see, I wasted valuable time and energy as I somehow managed to latch myself onto the one person who doesn't want or need me. I'll probably never tell you because this is something that has been building up over time, it's hard to articulate. I've witnessed you do the same to others, it was only a matter of time before the same happened to me. From this point on, I'll focus my energy on my passions and anyone who can love as much as I do. Although I've never told you, you'll probably know who wrote this because deep down you know this true. You're not as kind and generous as you make yourself appear to be.
