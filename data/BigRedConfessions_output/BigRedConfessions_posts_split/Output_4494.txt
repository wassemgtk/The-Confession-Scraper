I've been rejected from 90% of the singing/dancing groups at Cornell. I'm not saying its unfair because I know that I have nobody to blame but myself.  But the pain of knowing exactly what you're supposed to sound/move like in your mind, but yet your body can't accomplish it, is the shittiest feeling I've ever had to deal with.  I know I'm not good enough, and I know I'm only doing this to myself.  But it doesn't change how bad I feel.  Yes of course I'll reaudition next semester, Yes I know I may end up in the same place as I am now.  But my desire to perform surpasses everything, and if I look desperate for following my passion, so be it.
