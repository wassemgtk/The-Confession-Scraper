I broke up with him for a few different reasons, but the main one being that I wanted to explore once I transferred and I felt like being in a relationship would hold me back a little. I feel really selfish because of this but I feel like I needed to do this for me. I care about him so much and it breaks my heart to know that he still loves me.
