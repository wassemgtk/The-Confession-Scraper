It's funny how so many people don't think the Union of White Students at Cornell is real. I am a member and we meet in secret to protect our identities for fear of attack. It's a shame we cannot exercise our right to free speech, because we do not fit the liberal credo. We are not affecting anyone or advocating any violence, just a preservation of white culture and values. We welcome students from all walks of life and all races, colors, and creeds that would like to join in our mission. If there are other race-related clubs on campus, we will have a club to promote our European race and culture too.
