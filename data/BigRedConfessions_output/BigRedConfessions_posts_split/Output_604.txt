After so many hurdles through my academic career I finally graduate in May. A lot of people don't get why I'm so excited for graduation. Sure, I'll absolutely miss Cornell-- I have made so many friends and have had so many memories here, but I'm also so ready for the next step, even if I don't know what it is yet. Graduation will be a testament of all of the growth, hard work, and success I have had in the many years since high school (let's just say it's been more than four). Seniors, let's kick some ass this spring, and I'll see you all May 29!!!
