On January 30th, I took a walk to the little japanese garden at the Johnson like I often do. Usually no one notices me or visits the garden at night, but this time someone came while I was there and then left before I realized it. I wanted to talk to you, but then there was that couple that came and it didn't feel right. You also had your headphones on, as did I. 
Basically, if you read this, write a confession back because I'd really like to meet you.
