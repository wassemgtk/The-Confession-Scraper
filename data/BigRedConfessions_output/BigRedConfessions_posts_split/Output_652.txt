I go out on these dates, but I can only think of you.  I imagine you sitting next to me on the balcony, or on the beach.  Or walking down any street.  Or holding my hand, instead of some new guy holding my hand.  You are truly in my heart, and I hope you come to realize that we are beautiful together.
