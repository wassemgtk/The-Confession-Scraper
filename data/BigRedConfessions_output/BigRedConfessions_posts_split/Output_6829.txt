I don't want a career. I just want to move back to my hometown, work some service job, have an apartment with some Craigslist roommates, go to shows, explore new bars, meet tons of people, go for runs around town, get a dog, and fall in love with someone as clueless about life as I am. Would that make my Cornell education go to waste?
