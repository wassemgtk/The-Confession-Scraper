It's been a little over a year since we last parted ways, and I've had so many new experiences I wish I could tell you. Friends have come and gone, my major has changed more than a few times, and even a few girlfriends have taken your place. But as I sit in my empty dorm room on another dark, cold Sunday night, I can't help but reminisce on the pure beauty & innocence of our high school relationship.

Although I know you have moved on now and are happy, sometimes I selfishly wish you weren't. Or rather, I wish you weren't able to find another person to love so quickly, leaving me in the dust feeling unlovable. I know there are plenty of fish in the sea, but sometimes I despair that I may never experience the same beautifully visceral connection I had with you again.

I guess all I can do is keep searching.
