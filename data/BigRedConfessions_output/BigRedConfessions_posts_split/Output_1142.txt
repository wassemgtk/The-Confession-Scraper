I'm in an abroad program this semester. And I have gone to more classes than I ever did at Cornell and I do all my homework. It's harder. I'm making my best grades, but they still aren't good enough.

The thing is, the grades aren't reflecting it. There isn't a curve. Everytime I get a paper back it is full of corrections that I know, but just chose to omit due to the length. I realize this is on me, however, it's frustrating to see kids who never do the reading, never participate, consistently outscore me since they lack original thought in their essays. Or maybe I really am that stupid. 

Here I am, not at Cornell, making my highest grades, yet still somehow not coming up to snuff. I think I was underperforming at Cornell to protect myself from caring when I really do try.
