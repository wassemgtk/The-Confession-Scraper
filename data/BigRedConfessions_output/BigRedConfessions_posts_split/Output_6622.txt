There's a friend of mine who is obsessed with losing weight...I used to find her very attractive, and she doesn't know that everyone thinks she looks like a child now especially since she's petite and not very tall. Boys love curves, not sticks! It's nice when girls have toned but curvy bodies. Why do girls find that difficult to understand? I'm sorry, but I hope you realize that everyone is commenting on this now, and everyone finds it annoying and disturbing..We don't like eating with you anymore, and it makes people believe you have serious self-esteem issues. Please deal with it, because at one point your friends will all leave because of this as it makes them feel uncomfortable themselves.
