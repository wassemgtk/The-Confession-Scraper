To confession #5122 and the first commenter: 

I strongly encourage you to seek out help. I'm sure you already know about CAPS and EARS, and I cannot stress enough how much those have helped me and thousands of other students on this campus. I struggled with many of the same issues for much of my time here and it took me a long time to realize that I needed help; Cornell wasn't the sole source of my problems, and my depression was really distorting my image of what is, despite its faults and shortcomings, an amazing institution.
