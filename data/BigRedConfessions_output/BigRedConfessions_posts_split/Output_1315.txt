People should just go to the cheapest college they get into. Looking back on everything, it doesn't really matter where you go. Just about anyone can get a job anywhere and into any grad program if they want. But it will be cheaper and probably easier from a local school. Doesn't even have to be a more affordable private or a premier state school.
