Ladies nowadays say they want guys in general to be gentlemen yet in the same light wouldn't give a chance to guy that actually does act like a gentlemen. If a guy shows interest that is true and genuine ladies will not give him the time of day yet give another guy more attention then he ever deserves because he shows her no attention makes no sense to me. Nice guys finish last , I thought that was just in high school didn't know it translated into the college life also .....
