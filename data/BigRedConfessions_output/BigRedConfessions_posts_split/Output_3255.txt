I don't understand sex drive. In movies and news, whenever a man is deprived of a woman's company for a long time, say several years, it is accepted that he will be overcome with an overwhelming and uncontrollable urge to rape the first woman he sees. Is this real? Is this society? Biology? Am I just watching weird movies? I had sex a few times 2 years ago. I'm a perfectly sexual woman, but I could honestly see myself going the rest of my life celibate if I needed to. (without going insane/feeling unstable or uncontrollable)

Am I just too casual? Is this a gender thing?
