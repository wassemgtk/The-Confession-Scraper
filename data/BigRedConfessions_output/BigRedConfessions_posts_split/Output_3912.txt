"We dated for 3 months about a year ago. Everything was going great, we were having fun, I couldn't wait to be with you! You were about to introduce me to your parents, and then suddenly everything went downhill because of a silly detail. I've learned how much communication is important on relationships the hard way.

I hope you know how important you were to me, and how badly you broke my heart. It took me a long time to be enough over you to be able to have a life, but I think you will always be in my thoughts.

You are very special to be able to make three months enough to last for a lifetime in my memories."
