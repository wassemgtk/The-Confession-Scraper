I think I've been suffering from ADD/ADHD for as long as I can remember, and it's gotten pretty bad since freshmen year of high school.  I can't seem to focus on anything, my mind wanders when my professors speak, I see words on pages but they don't seem to make any sense to me, I can't remember the last time I was motivated by school, I'm forgetful, and I procrastinate like crazy.  

It's discouraging feeling my mind deteriorate while my parents refuse to believe I might have a problem, having every conversation about it end with my dad sternly saying that there's nothing wrong.  

Now that I'm eighteen and I'm relatively independent I've decided to figure this out regardless of what they think.  I just don't know where to start...
