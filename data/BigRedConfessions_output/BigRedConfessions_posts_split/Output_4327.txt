Recently, I have decided that I am going to end my life when I am like 40 or 45 years old. I'm not depressed or anything. I just want to be in control of when my life ends. However, if my life ended tomorrow, I honestly wouldn't care. I just don't see the point of living. I don't see the value in my life or anyone else's life for that matter. I don't know if that makes me a selfish or bad person. But, what I do know is that my life has significantly improved since making this decision. I am living each day more fully and trying new things because after all I have only 20 or so years left. On bad days, I just say to myself "only 20 more years of this sh*t. You can do this." The only down side to this decision is that I can't get close to anyone because then I might get caught up in feelings and such. I haven't been able to tell anyone about my decision because I'm afraid they will think I'm crazy or depressed or something. It feels good to finally get this off my chest. Cheers and thanks for reading!
