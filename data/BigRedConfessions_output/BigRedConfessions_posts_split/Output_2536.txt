To #5475:

I'm a guy who stopped talking to my best friend because she didn't reciprocate the feelings I had for her. Even though this circumstance may be different from yours, I think everyone can relate to the loss of a special someone you cared about with all your heart. From my point of view, I realized I shouldn't be stuck in the past and should always strive to be moving forward in life. My silence doesn't mean I don't forgive the person that hurt me- I still think about her every night. I'm just using the time to heal and become a better person. You say that this bridge is waiting for me to cross, but I'm not walking backwards anymore. I still miss my best friend, and I hope she'll build up the courage to cross that bridge herself. Even though I'm moving on, I'm a pretty easy guy to find. I wish you all the best #5475!
