You're such a slut, bringing all those different fugly frat guys over to fuck every week. Always seeking attention - everything has to be about you. You think you're so great, but honestly I can see right through you. You keep on squeezing everything out of me, from homework to cover letters - yeah, like you've never heard of it before. I'm so glad I won't be your roommate next year. Knowing what you did and what you'll do, I hope you get what you deserve. Karma's a bitch, and it's coming your way.
