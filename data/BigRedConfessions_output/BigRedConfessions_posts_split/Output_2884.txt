Honest question, when girls compliment obviously ugly chicks, is it honest, or are you just trying to make them feel better? Because there are some girls that are just ugly by all standards, and then they get comments on social media about how gorgeous they are, and I honestly start feeling like, yeah it will make them feel good for the moment, but everyone in this situation knows the truth. Also does the person who is getting complimented also think their friends are being honest? - Stuck In The Filter
