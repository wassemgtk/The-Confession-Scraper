I am DYING to date again. I broke up with my last boyfriend in 2011 and I'm still single. It's not that I need a man. Granted I have my feelings of inadequacy, and days where I just feel so unloved and alone, but I know I can survive and even be happy *gasp* on my own. I have done it for three years now. It's just that I want to be with someone, hold hands, have amazing sex, kiss and cuddle, watch movies with, have arguments with.... basically the whole relationship stuff. I am not asking to find THE ONE, even though I am probably "old enough". I am not looking for a serious commitment or a man to save me, but I just want someone I can be with and be myself with. Tinder is an option, but I always thought I wasn't desperate enough. Maybe I am. Maybe I am but I just won't admit it, I guess. I thought graduate school would be a new beginning, a new chance of finding someone who might see me through the haze of work, stress and the cold. But I guess I was wrong. What a way to end the year!
