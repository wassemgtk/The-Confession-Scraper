As an international student, I am appalled by the way lower-class Americans employed in servile professions like cleaners, baristas, and cashiers behave. In all countries those people are uneducated, but in America they are stupid. In all countries those people are not polite because they do not know how to be, but in America they are deliberately rude. In my country, and in other Asian countries, our service people are deferential and hard-working, or else they get fired. In America they are loud and obnoxious and lazy. The exception to this pattern of thinking, I have observed, is the waiters and waitresses who work extra hard for bribes. Maybe if Americans also stopped paying a minimum wage to other service personnel and made them work for bribes instead they would not have this problem.
