Everyone thinks I'm so strong and expects me to be all the time. It's hard to always be the strong happy person I pretend to be. I feel like I can't trust anyone anymore. In the past few months, I've lost three people that I loved and cared about in different ways. It's hard to get close to anyone anymore knowing they could be gone tomorrow.
