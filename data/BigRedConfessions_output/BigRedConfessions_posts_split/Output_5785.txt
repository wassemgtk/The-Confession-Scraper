I can't figure out what to think about the most recently kicked off fraternity. On the one hand, administration is kicking them off campus for hazing that cannot be proven based on an anonymous source who has never been interviewed with none of the pledges (who actually went through the hazing) confirming any incident. On the other hand, I know a few guys in the house and they definitely haze. But who will we be able to make fun of for butt chugging next year?
