To the person with the crippling pain that comes randomly-- not sure if you know what you have or not. If you don't, it sounds very much like you have fibromyalgia, which is a real disorder that you can get over yourself, or with some PT care. Not sure if this is relevant at all, but I had to put this out there just in case.
