I like a guy who goes to Cornell. I am in California but we used to talk online all the time, almost everyday, but I ran away when I realized I was falling for him. I tried to run away from my emotions but it is not possible. Now I just think about him and wonder why I left. I miss talking to him but I don't know how to reconnect.
