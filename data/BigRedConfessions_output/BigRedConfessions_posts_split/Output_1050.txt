In light of all these stories about the BRMB-
I joined the Big Red Marching Band my freshman year in hopes of making friends and I hated it.
Many sophomore were nice but the freshmen grouped off into pairs immediately, and the seniors were bullied. Parties were raunchy with lots of drinking and swearing and singing songs that made fun of Harvard.
I never knew what was going on and eventually stopped showing up. When I did show up, the seniors would make me feel bad for it and I just quit.
I wish I'd never bother to join at all - big waste of time.
But I'm happy for those who found a family there, even though I sure found it elsewhere.
