I don't know what might've been going through in my head last year, but I should've said fuck no to your offer of being my roommate. Stop being a narcissistic piece of shit and get over yourself; you'll be happier that way. Otherwise, I might just sock you in the face. But for now, I'll just avoid you once in a while. I don't care if we don't talk. One more thing... just as much as I will stay out of your way, stay out of mine. BITCH!
