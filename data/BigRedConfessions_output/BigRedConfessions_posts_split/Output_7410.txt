a friend of mine was accepted to medical school as an early assurance applicant in his freshman year. i know i should be supportive of him as a friend, but i am envious of him as a student. the pre-medical courses are so hard for me and they were so easy for him (his pre-medical gpa was the same as my cumulative gpa is). i get so sad when i see him so happy, not because he does not deserve it, but because he is so good at getting what he wants in life. even though i wish i were as good at life as he is, i know he is going to make a great doctor.
