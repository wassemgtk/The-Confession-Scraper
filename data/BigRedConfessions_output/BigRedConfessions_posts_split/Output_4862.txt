I love my parents but I feel like I hardly even know them. My mom works nights; so she's gone from 8 pm to 8 am the next day and then she sleeps until her next shift. My dad works from 6 am to 8 pm and comes home tired. Both work on weekends. I know that they're doing it so that my sister and I can get a good education but it feels like we don't have a family.
