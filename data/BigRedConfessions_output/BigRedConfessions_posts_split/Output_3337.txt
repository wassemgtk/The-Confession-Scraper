Got chewed out last semester by one of the people working in the office of the bursar for not having access to my dad's financial information.  So I got on top of my dad's unemployed ass and had him send everything in so I'd get some help this semester.  I expected something given Cornell's $5 billion endowment.  Nothing.  Every time I log into Student Center I see "You owe 56,572.36."  I'm a couple weeks away from being kicked off campus for not being able to pay.  I guess it was fun while it lasted...
