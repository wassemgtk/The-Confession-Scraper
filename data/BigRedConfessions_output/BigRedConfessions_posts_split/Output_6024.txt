"Hey Cornell,
Like many of you, I've been on far too few legit dates at Cornell. Seriously, I took a girl on a date once sophomore year but she didn't text me back so I figured it wasn't really worth it. Can't say that I've been on any other first dates at Cornell. But, I was thinking about it... and I've also had pretty bad relationships at Cornell (not bad in the sense of hateful or angry, just bland and not that enjoyable). So I figured a change in strategy was in order - but I don't know how one goes about getting set up for a blind date.

So... I decided to put a google form on Cornell Confessions :D. I'm basically going to ask each person who responds on a date. If its nice, maybe we'll go on some more. That's how this whole going on dates thing works right?

I'm a 5'10"" averge build white male looking for a date with a girl of any skin color, any height. I smoke weed and drink alcohol but its not important to me that you do. I'll be graduating in a few weeks, so I'm no.t looking for anything super legit, just somebody to chill with and have a good time. Personality, I'm an extrovert who finds politics fascinating but otherwise tries to not take himself so seriously

If your response to the above was ""sweet, free food"" rather than ""yea, a date would be fun,"" then kindly fuck off :D
