"Today is self-injury awareness day. For the past few years I've wanted to show my support by wearing an orange ribbon but I've always been too intimidated. I've even thought about just wearing a t-shirt and trying to ignore my scars. I wish I could take back what I've done to myself and now I have to live with permanent scars that I will always have to hide. 

I don't have the self-assurance to wear a t-shirt anymore, but to everyone else out there struggling just know that there are people out there thinking about you and who know what you're going through.

If you know anyone who is struggling with this, give them your support by reaching out!  Let your friends know you care. "
