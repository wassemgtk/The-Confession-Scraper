Dear people in GOV 1615 and basically all other big lecture classes. PLEASE DO NOT SIT IN THE AISLE IF YOU ARRIVE 10 MINUTES EARLY. It makes life a lot harder for those of us who straggle in as the professor starts lecture and can't quietly slip in, but inside have to shove past you, your laptop, your jacket, and your backpack to sit down in the middle of each row.
