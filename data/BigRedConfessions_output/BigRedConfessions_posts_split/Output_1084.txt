I have yet to date another Cornellian. I'm attractive, ambitious, and treat those around me with respect (sometimes not, I'm not perfect). Yet, something about me (maybe, maybe not) keeps others away. I sense it in myself. Recently, a friend of mine even questioned my sexuality, but I like men, I always have.
      The truth is I never got over you. I still remember the last time we spoke in high school. Now, whenever I think I'm crushing on another guy, something in me hesitates, pulls back, because deep down inside I haven't let you go. Baby, you are the last thing on my mind before each night's sleep. Being here, in Ithaca, is a special kind of hell, because it means we're a thousand miles apart. 
   Honestly, I'm tired of being alone, singledom bores me. Last I've heard you're playing college basketball back home. During break, when I see you next, I'll let you know my true feelings, either I put put this behind me or we move forward.
