It's really easy to feel lonely here, but my biggest challenge has been getting over the external blaming of the environment for that and trying to take control of the situation myself. Last year I spent all my time with two people, but both of them aren't in my life anymore so I'm trying to meet new people. I've tried clubs and all of that, and while I think I'm outgoing and make connections easy, I haven't really made any good friends. Would it be weird to post on a Cornell page (not anonymously) just honestly saying that I would love to meet new people and if anyone wants to make a new friend, we should meet for coffee. I know the answer is yes, but I also know that I shouldn't care. I figure as long as I stay myself and treat people well, and try to meet new people, it'll all turn out well. We'll see.
