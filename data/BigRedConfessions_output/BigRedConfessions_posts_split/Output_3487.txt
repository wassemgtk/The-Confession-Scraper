"I think I’ve overdone it. I’ve made it a nasty habit to, sometimes literally, run away from anything my heart and brain decide to jointly love. And I believe it is love. Possibly overdone brotherly love, but either way I am madly attracted by personality, and eyes, and his choices. I keep finding myself, telling myself that I’m not good enough for him. He doesn’t deserve me. But then I feel worse, because I know that for once I have found someone who is on my level, intellectually, as well as with wits, and humor, and laughter and affinity for life. In the few heart to heart conversations I’ve managed without letting my thoughts, aside from those of the conversation, get in the way, we have seen eye to eye. We’ve carried conversation over time and easily, calmly. He understands the importance of time alone, of silence, of the majesty of the morning when you feel like the only one alive and the world is yours. He notices the tiniest hints of humor, and knows that the turn of the head signals something has been spotted and he’s interested. He recognizes the sign of a person in distress. Which is why I think I scared him off. I can’t speak for him, I can’t say for sure what my face shows when I look at him, and help me, but if what I”m thinking when I happen to catch him eye to eye...those beautiful eyes...if only he knew, and yet that is what I fear. He is all that I have strived to be, devoted, kind, attentive, humorous, smart, focused and the list goes on. The respect I have for him is immense, and I feel like that could also be clouding my head when it comes to my emotions for him. 
 I’ve been trying to figure out how to let him go. The thing is, I don’t want to have to let him go, I want to be his friend, because I would be honored if he would let me be his friend. But everytime I get close, or have a friendly conversation, all I can think about afterwards is how much I just want to fall into those eyes, and I wonder what it would be like to earn his love. I imagine it would be impressive, and humbling, and very strong. 
 The similarities I’ve seen between the two of us is one of the ways that I’ve both connected and which I use to block him from my mind. We are so similar, I feel like we could be the sort to live quite well, being able to communicate, and be interested in the world etc, sharing interests, while also having unrelated ones to keep us with rounded personalities. And yet, these similarities I can tell myself are why it won’t work. Because if his response to feeling strong emotion towards someone not in the family is anywhere near mine, then we shall both be running in the opposite directions, running from our emotions. And because we can’t, because we live in the same dorm, and see each other every day, the most we can do is basically ignore the other. It makes me feel horrible inside. 
We are so similar that our reactions to unexpected or awkward attractions is to ignore it, to hide it, to throw it on the ground and test it’s strength. We’re waiting for someone to pick up the rock and hand it back, saying, yes, what you feel is real, and I feel it too. That rock heart you just threw? It hit my foot and hurt as much as it hurt for you to rip it out. Here, put it back, and let me warm your rock heart. But as usual, my aim is off, and as we each throw our respective rock hearts, they have missed their marks, leaving a scrape, but nothing more, and we stare at each other, why did you just throw a rock at me? Blink, and the connection is gone. Laugh, and my chest aches as I turn away. No. Don’t think. Don’t run. Don’t feel. Don’t be. Afraid. Don’t let it control. You. But jealousy? Passion? No. Just look away. Just walk. "
