Ok. So here is this girl with very beautiful eyes. She I guess is a CS major because I used to see her in Gates hall. Plus she was kind of auditing Computer Vision class this sem. She sometimes wears black nerdy types glasses. Sometimes used to wear nose ring too. Has a green color backpack I guess and used to have brown boots during winters. Has light brown long hair. I always used to think at least I should approach and talk to her. But I thought it might appear very creepy. Our eyes used to meet sometimes during the Computer Vision class which I was auditing too. I don't know what's her name or what's her no. or anything. But I feel if I never tried now, I might regret my whole life. I am regretting even now every time I used to see her in Computer Vision class this semester at Gates Hall , every time my heart would start pounding very heart giving an indication I should at least go and talk to her. But then my shyness would spoil everything for both of us. Me and my heart :-(. And whole day my heart would get angry and stop talking to me. :-(. 

If anyone is able to figure out the girl or know her name or any profile or link that would really help. Even know my heart sometimes thinks of her, stops talking to me often. And I end up placating him. So I want to get over this now. Tired of seeing his rudeness towards me every now and then.
