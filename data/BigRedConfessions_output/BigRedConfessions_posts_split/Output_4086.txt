I am SO FUCKING PISSED. Is it wrong to expect a little honesty, some integrity or some amount of respect from friendship? I always put myself out on a line to dry for people I care about, only to be left hanging on that same line. Giving someone else a chance to be honest is going to put me under the guillotine anyway. Why why why do I always trust the wrong people? Why do I have to get hurt to learn and actually never learn? So fucking tired of all this crap. Just wish I could go home.
