I made up a fake guy and a fake love story and a fake heartbreak because it was easy. It was easy to pretend that I was experienced, it was easy to say that my emotions were because of him because i didn't want to deal with what would happen if I no longer had him as an excuse. And now, I'm so deeply entrenched in the lie that I fear that telling people the truth will forever brand me as a liar and an untrustworthy person when really, it was just a stupid mistake, just a stupid facade that went on for too long.
