To start off, I am a guy and I show I am as emotionally strong as anyone can be. I am also a person that cares a lot about others. As a first-year student, I have experienced things I haven't experienced in my entire life, and I know everyone goes through it (Not performing well in classes, perhaps). It is the reason why I always smile. I smile at everyone that passes by, whether or not I know the person. I try to be as supportive as possible, because helping simply makes me happy.

I am the type of guy that if I see you in an elevator with no headphones, I would ask "Hey, how are your classes going?" or "How are you feeling?". However, that's non-reciprocal. I see no one asking me how am I feeling or how am I doing. It could be that I show that I am always happy, but I want to tell that even though I show I am emotionally strong, I do have feelings and feel sad most of the times. Being away from my family has made me view the world in different ways, and appreciate everyone I had around me. 

I just can't wait till Finals' week is over so I can hug my entire family, that despite of how I do in school, is always there to support me.
