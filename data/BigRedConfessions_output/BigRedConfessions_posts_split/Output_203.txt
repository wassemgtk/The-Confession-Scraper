The two of you are just so buddy-buddy lately, and our only interactions have been your telling me about all the things you've talked about without me, and sending pictures of all the things you do together without me, and how you've just had so much fun hanging out together... That's great and all, but why? Do you rub it in like that just to feel better about yourselves being closer to each other than to me? Or what is the point you're trying to make?
