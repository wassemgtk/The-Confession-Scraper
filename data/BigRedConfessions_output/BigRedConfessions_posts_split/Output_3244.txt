One of the only sources of happiness I had was looking at your profile and hoping to find the courage to talk to the strongest, bravest, most beautiful woman I've ever known. 

Reading all that you've written makes me love your mind even more.

But it's gone. You either blocked me or deactivated your fb, but I don't have the gall to ask anybody I know which one. 

Getting to talk to you even just more than once would make my life here at cornell worth it.
