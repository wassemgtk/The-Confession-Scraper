I really just need to say it somewhere. I love you. I didn't mean for it to happen. It shouldn't have happened, but it did. Sometime during the casual hookups, I fell for you, hard. Now, you want to be "just friends," but I have no idea how to tell you how impossible that is for me. It hurts too much to have just part of you, so I think I'll have to give up all of you. I'm sorry.
