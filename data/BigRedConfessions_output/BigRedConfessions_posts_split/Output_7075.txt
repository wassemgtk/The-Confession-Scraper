Look guys, I think Greek yogurt is awesome too.  And it's lovely that Chobani uses local milk products so I fully support the brand.  But for the love of God, do NOT eat Chobani in class.  NO.  It may taste good but it smells distractingly unpleasant.  You seriously can't wait until you're in a designated food area to stuff your face?  For that matter, please don't eat ANYTHING that smells strongly, requires crunching, or wrapper crinkling in class.  It is distracting as fuck and everybody hates you.
