I've been going through a lot of absolute shit these past few months, and one of my mechanisms of releasing stress is playing Pokémon. Recently, I was playing Pokémon Emerald, and I caught a Wailmer. I was then surfing around, and found a higher level Wailmer! I then caught that one too. I headed over to the PC, and released the lower level one, then it immediately came back to me and it said that the Wailmer really cared about me. I finally know what love is.
