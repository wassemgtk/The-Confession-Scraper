"To my roommate:
I cannot believe you outright asked me if I liked you or not. ""I just sometimes get the feeling that you don't like me very much."" What the hell kind of response were you looking for? If I act like I don't like you and if I don't talk to you much, it's because I don't like you and don't want to hear your nasally voice tell me about your dumbass problems. I pride myself on being an honest person and I hate that you pushed me into a corner and made me lie, simply because we have to survive each other's presence until May. Honey, now you can guarantee that every word that comes out of my mouth will protest your very being. "
