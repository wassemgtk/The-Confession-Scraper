when my friends tell me about how much they are enjoying the dates they go and and how they spend nights in their date's dorms just cuddling and having a good time,i hate to admit it but I find myself getting jealous of them. I would want to go on dates and spend time with my boyfriend... but he's lives far away, and while my friends are out having a movie night with guys, I'm just in my room missing my boyfriend.
