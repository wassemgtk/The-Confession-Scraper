On Friday night, the girl of my dreams broke up with me. We had been dating for over a year and a half. I don't know how to function without her. I feel like a part of me is gone. Not a small part. like an arm, a lung and half my heart's worth of parts. I've cried myself to sleep the last two nights and probably will for the next two months +. But I don't regret a single second of what we had.
