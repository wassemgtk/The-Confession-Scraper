Dear girl who i used to think was the most beautiful girl at Cornell,

I used to think you were the most beautiful girl at Cornell.

To think. You're beautiful and intelligent. 

Yet you think praying to imaginary deities is something you need to do in order to apologize for bad actions. 

I was so saddened to see that picture
