As I feel another round of depression creep over me, I'm telling myself: what's the big deal? snap out of it. toughen up. man up. what's there to be so down about? YOU'RE FINE. your life could be worse, so STOP feeling sorry for yourself. you're pathetic. stop whining. no one wants to be friends with a whiney pessimist....

I've battled depression several times now and I know what I have to do to feel better. But after so many times, I'm exhausted. I'm finding it difficult to conjure up the willpower and strength to fight it once again. I feel I am in a never ending war with myself. All I want is lasting peace. Hopefully, I can find it one day.
