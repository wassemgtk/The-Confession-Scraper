I love you so much, and you're so good to me. The problem is, I'm such an awful bitch to you. I know where I get it from, but I can't blame my upbringing; I'm an adult, I take responsibility for my actions. It's just something I do without thinking now, constantly lashing out at you about the smallest things just because I'm stressed. We're all stressed at Cornell, though, and that doesn't give us the right to be horrible to each other. It's funny, people think of me as such a sweetheart - I used to think of myself as such a sweetheart before I got comfortable in this beautiful, wonderful relationship we have. I hope I find a way to curb my awful temper before I destroy everything.
