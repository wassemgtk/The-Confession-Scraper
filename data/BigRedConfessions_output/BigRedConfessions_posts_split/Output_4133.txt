People don't realize how destructive being a real introvert actually is. I'm not one of those people who calls themselves an introvert because it's funny or interesting. I actually don't know how to interact with people, and so I stay in my room doing homework or playing video games all day. All I want in the world right now is to find a good group of people to call my friend group. As it is, I don't have a single person here whom I would call my friend. I hate it.
