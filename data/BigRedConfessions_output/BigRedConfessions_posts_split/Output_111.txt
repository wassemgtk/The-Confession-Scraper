"I wish my former friend at Cornell peace and the best of intentions. I realized that me judging my former friend for failing to follow the life of God, was making me fall into the trap of Satan. I know that my friend's actions will be judged not by me but by God and I can only hope that my friend can seek reconciliation and forgiveness for failing to follow the Bible and to embark onto God's way of life once again. For I realize that ""he ascended to heaven and is seated at the right hand of God the Father almighty. From there he will come to judge the living and the dead."" I hope my friend can receive a blessing from God and find Christ in their life again as it would bring happiness into their life. I say “Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.” -John 14:27 I hope my friend can one day try a Christian mass at Sage Chapel and find Christ there once again. Amen.
