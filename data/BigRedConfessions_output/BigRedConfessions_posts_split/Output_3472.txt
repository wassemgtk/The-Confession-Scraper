I think it's absolutely ridiculous that you're graduating with a bachelor of science when I know for a fact that your plaigirised all of your physics and chem work, your lab work over the last two years and you're completely incapable of supporting any of the outrageous claims you'ved made. I've never been on the side of a whistle blower before but I think this is something I need to bring up to the committee for Arts. #sorrynotsorry #cheatingisnotok
