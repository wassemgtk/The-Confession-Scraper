Being a physics student in university, naturally I am surrounded by a plethora of highly intelligent peers. The one complaint I hear the most is not whether someone failed a test or is worried about getting into grad school, rather it is the fact that they can't seem to find a girlfriend. That being said, I also know many highly intelligent guys who have amazing relationships; in fact intelligent people have the potential to have the greatest relationship because they can be so creative with birthday, Christmas gifts, and other aspects of the relationship! However, there is at least a significant proportion of highly intelligent guys who mope around, complaining about being single and not knowing what to do about it. There are plenty of articles online saying that the solution is to stop being so arrogant about intelligence and to “chill out” but I think the problem really boils down to being too idealistic about the natural selection process. 

“My genes are superior, why doesn’t she choose me?”

The first thing you need to realize is that getting a girlfriend is a skill that needs to be developed, just like soldering a circuit board, just like doing surface integrals in your Calc. III class. While you were sitting at home perfecting word for word the solution to your next real analysis homework, your competitor was out there performing some APPLIED analysis on the girl psyche and figuring how to woo her heart and make her smile. That's why he has a hot girlfriend and you have, well, your left hand. Too many intelligent guys think that women are things to be earned, things that they are entitled to. That if you worked hard and made a lot of money or became famous in your field, women will come flocking to you. This may be true if you’re Elon Musk, but for the rest of us mortals, finding a (hot?) girl that is worth hanging onto requires practice and diligence. Sure if you’re striving to be the next Newton and couldn’t give two shits about human intimacy then please be my guest and continuing carving out human history undistracted. Most guys want successful, enriching relationships and therefore need to put the work in, to get the work out.

“I have a 6-pack and I’m on my way to a PhD in physics, so what’s the problem?”

I have many friends who are both intelligent and physically fit, the two traits required for successful natural selection, or you would think anyway. One of them said to me the other day “I’m working up to 205lb on the bench press, unless I hit that, I’m not going to talk to any girls.” This is exactly the type of thinking that will make sure you stay single until you’re 80 and your balls turn into raisins. Being able to bench press or being brilliant at electrodynamics and being a good (enjoyable) boyfriend are completely different faculties. If you asked any given girl (even the most intelligent ones), most of them will say being intelligent or talented in a certain field is a bonus and NOT the deciding factor in picking a boyfriend. At the end of the day, the goal of every girl on earth is to be happy and you can provide this happiness (and receive it too!) by developing loyalty, sympathy, and a sense of humor (characteristics that were unanimously voted the most sought after in a guy by girls across the 11 dimensions).

“The problem is them, not me!”

At the end of the day you might think everything I’ve said is bullshit and that the only reason why you don’t have a girlfriend is because there are no intelligent but pretty girls out there that suit you. But just remember this, given the off chance that you do one day come across that unicorn-of-a-girl, do you really want your romantic abilities to be as linear as your ODE assignment?
