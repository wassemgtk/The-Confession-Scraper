I don't know what it is about you, but I really want something with you. And I'm scared. We barely know each other. But I just know I want you. I want to tell you all of this. Just now my dog did this funny thing and I wanted to text you but we're not there yet, we barely text. I have no idea what you're feeling, and I doubt you want something to come from this. The semester's almost over anyway. But I like you more every time I see you. It feels different for some reason. Just please do something with this. Please make us an us.
