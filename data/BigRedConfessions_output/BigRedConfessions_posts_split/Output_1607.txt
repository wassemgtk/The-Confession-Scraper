I'm a freshman here and it's very hard to live in a dorm occupied by mostly outgoing people. I don't know when "college life" became synonymous to "getting shitfaced drunk and bragging about how many girls I fucked" but I certainly wasn't notified of the change. It doesn't help that I'm male either. For some bizarre reason, I am expected by society to go on drunken rages, show off my "masculinity", and act like a neanderthal. I've overheard some of my dorm mates talking behind my back a few days ago. They were calling me a loser for not being at frat parties and hooking up with random girls. I had my door locked and closed so apparently they assumed that I was at the library studying like I normally do. Every word stung bitterly. Back home I was taught that real men are responsible and caring. At Cornell, I guess the degree of your manhood is measured by the amount of alcohol you consume and the number of girls you have sex with. Honestly, I don't give a single fuck about what they're doing in their own time. They can drink, they can have sex freely, they can do drugs, if that's how they socialize. But insulting my own way of living behind my back is just rude  Luckily, I found my own social group of introverts so I don't feel as alone. I just wish people would stop branding me a "loser" for just wanting to spend a part of my day by myself.
