Yeah, I'm pretty pissed right now. We just got home to our apartment after you told me I couldn't go to the bathroom in Wegmans, I needed to wait till we got home. So we get home and YOU go into our apartment's only bathroom. So now I had to wait the 10 minute car ride home, plus 10 minutes for you to use the bathroom, plus another 10 minutes once you come out for the smell to clear. I am pissed off.
