Here's how bad my OCD is. I've just learned about the dozenal system - that is base 12 - and how much superior it is to the decimal system. What's worse is, I've learned that it is the most efficient and best system to use, because 12 is the smallest number with the most factors. It's divisible by 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12, as opposed to 10, which is only divisible by 1, 2, 5, 10. So in dozenal, 1/3, 1/4, 1/6 are whole numbers. So it turns out there IS a best counting system to use, and the whole world DOES NOT use it. And now every time I see a number I go - ughhhh, it's fine but it could be better. Why can't everything be optimized for efficiency. Why can't we use base 12. Serious OCD.
