"My long-distance relationship has been in a less-than-ideal state for months, but we were both trying hard. We visited each other as often as possible (unfortunately, that means about once a semester) and Skyped daily. We had our issues, but we both knew we loved each other, and at the end of the day we were comforted by what seemed an unshakable bond.
Then I came out as an asexual biromantic (instead of bisexual) and although my boyfriend hasn't broken up with me yet, I'm afraid it's heading that way. We still Skype, and he says he'll visit me at the end of his semester, but it feels like he secretly is just waiting for me to change his mind.

The thing is, this didn't come to a surprise to him at all. He's always known I don't enjoy sex, even after I stopped having panic attacks during/after. At first I blamed it on being molested years ago, although I knew that after a few months, I wasn't thinking of that at all when sex left me hyperventilating and shaking, trying not to vomit. He said it might be because I'm more attracted to girls than boys. Honestly, sex with a girl sounds just as repulsive as with a guy; I'd love to kiss or cuddle, even naked if you like, but please don't touch my genitals. I've given countless handjobs, but receiving one is worse - it leaves me nauseous and guilty for feeling the way I do.
Actually, I don't think I can stand giving one more handjob either. And handjobs were my only way of giving him sex without actually having sex. Our relationship isn't based on sex (truly it isn't, although it's what I've focused on in this post - we love cooking together, watching movies together, cosplaying together, talking politics or arguing over bands or just napping together), but to him, sex is a necessary component. He feels that if there's no sex, and there's never going to be any sex, we are close friends but not lovers.

And although he's not coming off in a great light right now, he has been my rock through the past year. He's supported me when my parents cut me off emotionally, he's begged me to see a therapist for my depression and anxiety, he checks in on me to make sure I'm doing my homework and going to class, he's trying to get me to exercise and be healthy. He's my best friend and the only person to whom I truly feel close, and I don't think I could bear to lose him right now. He's hoping I'll take back what I've said, and I wish I could. But we both know I am asexual, and there's no looking back now.

That being said, I don't blame him for freaking out. Sex is very important to him, I get that. I understand that his sexuality is just as important to him as mine is to me. But all this does is get me to hate myself because I don't want to give something so important to our relationship.
I had suicidal thoughts before coming out, but now I'm too depressed to go to class or work or anything.
And the worst thing is, he's still supportive. He feels so horrible about how I feel, but we've based our relationship on honesty and if we're being honest, we're not the best match. It's the most heartbreaking thing I've ever gone through.
