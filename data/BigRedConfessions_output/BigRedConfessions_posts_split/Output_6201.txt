"For a whole semester I have had a crush on you, invited you to events, made excuses to talk to you, the works. I obviously wanted to get with you, but I also wanted to be friends. You seemed like a cool guy and if nothing romantic sparked between us I was more than fine to just be friends and share ideas.

Buuuut you decided to act like an asshole and ignore me to ""let me down easy,"" as if I'm some sort of fragile little girl who will crumble at your rejection. Please, I'm an independent woman, I am strong, and I can take no for an answer. The fact that you made a wrong assumption made me lose respect for you.

Continue moping around waiting for a girlfriend while you alienate anyone who tries to be just friends with you. You are an asshole, and I am not surprised you're still alone."
