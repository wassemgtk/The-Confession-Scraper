Been feeling kind of bogged down lately. Haven't been on tumblr in a while, saw this on my dash:

"Sometimes you end up never speaking to someone who meant the world to you again. And that’s okay. You cope and you survive. Don’t let your losses keep you back from new gains."

Felt better. I'm human; If I can do it, you can, too.
