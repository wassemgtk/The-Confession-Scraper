You have been reading all these posts of seniors talking about graduation on Cornell Confessions and asked me how I felt. At the time, I gave you a very generic answer, but this is how I truly feel.

I think like most Cornellians, I came to Ithaca with big dreams and grand plans for my future. When I first got here, I made a lot of great friends and academically put myself in a great position. However, I always wanted to make myself more than just a boy with big silly ideas and actually do something significant with my life. But when one of my life goals flopped, I was devastated that it was so easy for me to surrender my principles. The disappointment in myself led me to sabotage most of my friendships and let my schoolwork go to crap. I lived my life aimlessly without purpose, and I begin to rely on alcohol not because it helped me forget what kind of loser I was becoming but because alcohol was just a better pilot of my life than I was.

I was so emotionally unstable that I jumped into an awful relationship with the absolutely wrong girl. We dated for far too long, and I fooled myself to believe that one day I was going to marry her. In hindsight, I was never really happy in that relationship and even though we dated for almost two years, I do not think I ever truly loved her. She was controlling, and I was constantly miserable. However, I couldn't leave the distraction from my other failures that her comfort brought me. Thus, I just learned to live with sadness in order to forget my own failures. Eventually that affected my grades even further, but this time it also turned me really obese. 

Then last semester (my senior year), I walked in on my girlfriend cheating on me. Later I found out that she had been cheating on me for months. I really hope that none of you experience what I felt that day, but for days and weeks, I couldn't even move, eat, think or sleep. Then two weeks later my parents dropped a bomb and told me that they got divorced. 

My already broken world came shattering down on me. My schoolwork meant absolutely nothing to me, and my once bright image of my future seemed like a nonsensically romantic passage from a book I had read a long time ago. However, even at that moment, when I expected my life to completely crumble down and consume me, I realized that I was still somehow standing up. That is when I found my last few friends struggling to keep me standing. 

That's the moment that I realized that life isn't a fucking romantic poem or a play. It's a dirty and gritty back alley fistfight with no rules. I always thought that maybe I had finally reached the low point of my life, and that things were just going to magically turn around. No, life is going to constantly beat you till your eye socket caves and drowns you in your blood and pus. It's our job to put our guards up and throw everything back at it. I was lucky enough that despite many of my questionable actions, a couple of my friends stuck around to make sure I wasn't knocked out for good.

The moment I realized that simple but harsh truth, I finally took charge of my own destiny and began to realign my life. I started getting my work done and wrote great graduate school applications. I started working out obsessively and since the breakup I have lost over 35lbs. It may be extremely shallow, but it was the greatest feeling when girls started noticing me again. When a girl said to me, ""holy crap you got hot..."" I excused myself and went to the restroom and cried. It was the most difficult couple of months of my life, but I was also lucky enough to get into my dream grad schools and even a couple of job offers.

I finally got my life in order, but I also realized that without a light at the end of the tunnel, life was nothing more than a meaningless brawl that will eventually kill me. I tried my best to move on from what happened with my parents and my ex, but deep down I didn't think I could ever trust or fall in love with someone ever again. I knew I had to keep fighting, but I didn't know why, and sometimes I would just sit down on a bench and have a difficult time convincing myself why I should stand back up again.
That is when I first saw you. When we first met...(this is so cliche but....) my heart literally skipped a beat and my mind drew a blank for a couple of seconds, because I couldn't deal with how beautiful you looked. However, as an expert in sadness, I could immediately see through your mask and tell that you too had your heart broken and that you were also not at a great place in your life. When we started talking, I soon discovered that underneath that layer of deep sadness was the most beautiful and special person that I have met in my lifetime. I know I am not supposed to say it, but I fell in love with you the day we first met. You became the final missing piece in assembling my broken life, you taught me that I could love and trust someone again. We have only known each other for a little over a month now, but we have both helped each other heal ourselves and become better people.

So here it is.... I am looking forward to my new bright future ahead of me, but I am torn that soon we will be separated. My only regret in Cornell, even after all that drama and sadness, is that we did not meet earlier. But one day I will return to your life and Ted-Mosby-Robin you, because you are my green light across the bay.
