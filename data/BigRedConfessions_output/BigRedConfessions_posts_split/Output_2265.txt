It's been really hard working up the nerve to share this confession with the world, but imagining the relief I'll feel once I hit ""submit"" makes it all worth it. My confession is thus:

I have a hard time getting homework done on the weekends, even though I have no issue devoting all my time to it. 
Anyone else have this problem? What do you do to get your brain buzzing on your off days? Comment below, please! :)

My brain and body just function slowly come Saturday, and come Sunday night I never quite know what I did during the weekend other than eating some meals and doing some class and clerical stuff that appear to have taken all day. On Friday, I make a list of what needs to get done. I usually have zero to two extracurricular activities scheduled for Friday evening, Saturday and Sunday combined, and I never imbibe. I like all my classes, so my work is generally fun for me. I can rarely say, ""At least I got distracted by fun stuff, or things that are important to me"", because I usually don't do those things until I complete my school checklist (though I've started to now, just to use the time somehow). Homework always comes first, but that doesn't make it come fast.
