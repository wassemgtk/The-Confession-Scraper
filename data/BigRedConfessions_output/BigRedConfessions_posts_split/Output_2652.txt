Dear girl in Basu's class in front of me who is talking throughout the class while looking at answers for online quizzes someone sent you... Pay attention instead of cheating. It isn't worth $60k a year just to do this in class. P.S. Art, two ilr classes, and intro macro? What a light semester to be cheating...
