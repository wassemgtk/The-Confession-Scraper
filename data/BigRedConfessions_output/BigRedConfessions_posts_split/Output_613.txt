I see that many of the radical feminists at Cornell attack men for objectifying women and saying that the sexual revolution of the 60's was beneficial. Let me educate you though: The sexual revolution of the 60's did nothing but objectify women because women are "used" by men to get instant gratification and they move onto another woman. That's why more young women feel depressed than ever before. In the 1930s-1950's women were put on a pedestal and were respected. Pre-marital sex was very rare and couples waited, instead of seeking instant gratification before they engaged in sexual intercourse. Studies have show this is why marriages have lasted and the divorce rate was very insignificant compared to the high divorce rate of 50% we have today. Plus, women were respected by men. Men protected even women they did not know in public from being attacked and the majority of men learned to NEVER hit a woman unlike today. Plus women did not try to act like men and rough, which was nice. I wish we had more women with a nice, kind sweet voice with a New York accent like Jackie Kennedy. If anything, learn from the past and realize that the sexual revolution has done nothing but encourage the proliferation of single-parent children and STDs. The reason why many feminists cannot comprehend these facts is because they live in a bubble and do not want to face the facts.
