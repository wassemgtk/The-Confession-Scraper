I really like this girl and we are going our ways in a month and I still don't have the guts to tell it to her because we share a really good friendship which I don't want to ruin. I know its now or never and I somehow wish she feels the same too but sadly I don't think she does and I don't want to risk it. I just want to share it with someone.
