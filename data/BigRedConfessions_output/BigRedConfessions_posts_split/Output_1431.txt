I am miserable. I have no friends, 2 incompletes and I feel ugly inside and out. There is a part of me that thinks that college was the worst decision of my life. The degree is necessary for professional mobility, but the attitude, the classes, the people... aren't me. I can't wait to graduate in the spring and firmly repress this experience for the rest of my life.
