It's excruciatingly difficult for me to make friends with the people physically around me. Not because I lack social skills, but because we share no common ground. I come across as boring or quiet, when in reality I'm just in the wrong environment. I feel like a square peg in a round hole. We practically (okay, figuratively) speak different languages. But maybe we literally speak different languages, too: you all use jargon, jokes, and references that completely fly over my head. I know it's bad to be greedy, because I already have a lot of great friends on the web, but sometimes it hurts not having friends to live with and experience everything side-by-side.
