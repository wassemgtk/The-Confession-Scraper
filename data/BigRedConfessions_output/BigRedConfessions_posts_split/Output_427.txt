I'm surprised how many Republicans/Conservatives(Socially or Financially) I've met on campus. However it isn't something that you learn until you are close enough with each other. It's like something that we have to hide. I'm not saying all Democrats/Liberals are self-assertive, but there are definitely very few things to worry about if you are forthright about your Liberal views. Unfortunately Conservative and Republican have negative connotations in the heads of many people and are not willing to converse. I urge anyone else who has opposing views to be proud of your views and not be afraid to hide them from others.
