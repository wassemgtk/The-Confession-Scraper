I'm surprised how distraught I am at the thought of you leaving.  Can't we just have a nice fling before we part ways? We fit together so well!  I'm not expecting anything more than casual.  Really I just want to experience one night in your arms.  But I know it's not going to happen.

(A part of me is convinced it's because I'm not tiny and cute)
