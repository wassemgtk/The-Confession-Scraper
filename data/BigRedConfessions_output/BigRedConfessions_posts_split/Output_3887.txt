"From what I've seen, Cornellians are usually sympathetic towards others - they fight against sexual harassment, racism, and poverty, even when it doesn't pertain to them directly.

And from most people I've talked to here, they're incredibly understanding of their friends having anxiety problems, depression, bipolar disorder, 

But the disorder I've always struggled with I can never bring up to anyone... ADHD.  I wasn't on medication until very recently, and it doesn't help much academically besides keep me more organized. I take the same amount of medication on a Saturday in bed as I do for a Thursday night prelim. 

And yet, everyone I've talked to here thinks ADHD is a psuedo-disorder to prescribe stupid kids with ""performance enhancing drugs."" I've heard so many times ""Oh I'm diagnosed with ADHD too after I couldn't focus on my work. But I mean that's everyone right?""

NO, it's not. ADHD, at least for me, is a constant daily struggle to be a normal, functional human being. It's being miles slower at every simple physical process. It's having to constantly remind myself to not leave my wallet somewhere.

It's forgetting someone's name even though you've known them for weeks or even years and know all about them. It's forgetting what someone said 3 seconds ago and appearing disinterested even though you really care. 

Medication really does help night-and-day in many of those social and organizational aspects.  But if I was to tell anyone that, they would jump the gun to the cognitive bias of ADDERALL--> ULTRA-CONCENTRATION ON TESTS-->CHEATING.
