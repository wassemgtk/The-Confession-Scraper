I finally found her. And it's amazing. It's like I haven't been living on Earth. After years and years of disappointment and heartbreak, I once again came to the inevitable conclusion that there is NO amount of failure that trying can't fix. I see so much heartbreak on this page. Keep trying, fellow Cornellians. If you're kind and you work hard, amazing things WILL happen. You WILL find her/him. And your job. And your city. And your life.
