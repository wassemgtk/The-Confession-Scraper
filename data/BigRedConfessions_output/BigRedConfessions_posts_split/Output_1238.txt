I'm a scumbag. Well, maybe that's a little harsh, but I'm not the nice guy girls tell me I am. When I first came to Cornell, I most certainly was the nice guy, the guy who complained about the "friend-zone" (spoiler alert: it doesn't exist). As soon as it was possible, I entered a relationship with a very sweet, nice girl. She was very into me, and I was thrilled to have someone who liked me for once. This was all well and good for about a month, until I realized I didn't like her, I just liked the idea of her. Trying to be fair, I broke it off. I tried again, but realized I had done the same thing to an equally sweet girl who didn't deserve to have to deal with me. I realized all the things I was doing wrong, my misgivings about what love/relationships meant. I stayed away from the dating game for a while, focusing on actually being friends with a girl for once. I still felt empty. I got better at conversations, saying the right things at the right points, stopped being "weird" in public. Acne cleared up, cleaned up my wardrobe, and realized I could hookup with girls, almost no strings attached. So I did. I tried to fill the void with meaningless sex, constantly lying, saying anything to get with these girls because I selfishly thought that would make me happy. Don't get me wrong now, these girls were almost certainly using me as well. I'm booty-called more often than I booty-call. Consent is sexy, folks. Now, I look at myself, constantly shifting between different girls to hookup with, and I'm still not happy. I thought I believed in love. I thought sex would fulfill something in me. I thought I was living the college male's dream. Casual sex, no strings, no drama, no bullshit. I don't know what I want, and I don't know if I'll be able to be happy. I'm not sure what I'm trying to say here, but all I know is, I can't seem to make myself happy. And that terrifies me. I'm not looking for sympathy, I just need to say these things, ya know? 

Tinder was one of the worst things to ever happen to me.
