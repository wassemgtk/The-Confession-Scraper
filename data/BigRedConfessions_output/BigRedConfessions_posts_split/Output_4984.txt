There are honestly so many people I would love to unfriend/unfollow on social media but I can't because nowadays people take that shit so seriously. Just because I unfollowed you on instagram doesn't mean that our friendship is over or that I despise your existence, it just means you post stupid ass shit that I don't want to see every two hours. We don't need to see the selfie you took while mowing the lawn. We also don't need to see the haircut selfie thats just an obvious attempt to show your tits. We also don't need to see the pic of you holding your Starbucks cup over your steering wheel in a desperate attempt to show off to everyone about your CLA250 that you're leasing. It's just sad.
