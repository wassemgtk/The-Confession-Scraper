It's been almost a year and I am still not over you. I sometimes hope that I will hear from you out of nowhere but then I know that after what I said the last time we talked about us, you probably don't want anything to do with me. You moved on but I haven't. When I saw you the other day, I couldn't help but think that maybe you were right when you said we were not meant to be together and I should stop waiting for you to come back to me.
