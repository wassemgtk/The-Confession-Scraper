There were so many things I wanted to do at Cornell but depression and social anxiety held me back. Now I'm a junior and I'm more comfortable with getting involved with clubs in the fall but it's so hard to so as a senior. I'm so mad at myself for missing all my chances freshman year. I hate having mental health problems.
