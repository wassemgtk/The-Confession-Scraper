I'm only close to my mother and brother, but somehow when I'm angry, I manage to lash out at them and hurt them the most. I know their weaknesses and use those against them. It's become worse in recent times since I'm not where I want to be in life, and even the smallest things irritate me. My irritable behavior makes them say a few things, but I always respond worse, going in for the kill every time. I love them a lot, and every time I hurt them, it hurts me. I wish I could stop being so emotionally abusive.
