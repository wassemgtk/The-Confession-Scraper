How do you go from friends to more-than friends? I wouldn't be afraid to go for it if we didn't hang out in the same friend group so much. If you didn't feel the same way about me, then it would be awkward to hang out with you so much still, and I feel like I would have to give up a lot of the time I spend with our friends.
