He was my TA last semester and I often caught him staring at me in class. We spent time after class discussing problems and got to know each other much more towards the end of the semester. He always broke into a smile when I talked to him and would be the opposite of his usual, reserved self. Even my classmates noticed this and smiled at how at ease and vulnerable he felt around me. We had a great chemistry and it seemed to be a mutual attraction. I've been trying to keep in touch since, but he is acting so distant now. Part of me thinks he's just really busy as a grad student, but if he really likes me, wouldn't he at least show some kind of effort? I guess I should move on, but I've never felt this strongly about somebody :(
