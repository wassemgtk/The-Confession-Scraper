I have a relatively good life. I am doing okay in school. I have great friends and a caring family that I feel so blessed to have. But often I walk alone around campus and collegetown late at night and just reflect on my life both at home and here at Cornell. I pass places on campus that hold memories- some good and some bad. No matter how good my life is at the moment, whenever I take these walks I can't help but yearn to run away and never stop running, and somehow fade into the darkness leaving everything, everyone, and my entire identity behind me.
