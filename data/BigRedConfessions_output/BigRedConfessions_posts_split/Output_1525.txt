i love cornell, but recently ive been feeling so lonely.
I have friends, I'm even on a team (academic one). But every time I make new friends, i become too clingy. I start asking to do everything with them, and I know that they eventually get tired of me. eventually these "friends" start doing things and not inviting me, or just ignore me whenever I say/suggest something. it really sucks. Maybe I am too clingy, but im not like rude/annoying. I don't know what to do.
I've been, as many of us are, under a lot of stress, and I destress by being around friends and doing fun things, but recently ive just been growing further and further apart from not just my friends, but team mates too. and i cant talk about this to anyone, cause i dont want them to think im some attention seeking psychologically disturbed kid. Im not. im an ordinary guy. im actually really loud, try to be funny, and social. but as most lonely people know, that doesnt mean anything.
then theres also the people who just belittle me all the time, idk why. maybe cause they think im annoying, or maybe cause they just dont like me. but i try to avoid them as much as possible, but obviously i cant always avoid them. 
if ur reading this, u will prolly never figure out who i am, even if u know me. but i seriously just wish i had someone to talk to.... a friend who would actually understand how im lonely, but still pretty happy and not like disturbed or troubled, and wouldnt judge me for it.
