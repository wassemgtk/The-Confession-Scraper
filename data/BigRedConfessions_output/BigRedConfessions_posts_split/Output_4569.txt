I'm so glad I have such good friends here who can cheer me up and make me smile when I should be so sad. Both my grandma and grandpa died and I'm halfway around the world. I came to cornell 6 months ago knowing no one and found a lot of receptive people who are really helping me,I just wish airplane tickets were not so expensive so I could go back home and hug my mom
