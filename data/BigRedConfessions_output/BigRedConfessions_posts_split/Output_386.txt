I wish I could go to LA to photograph the beautiful Art Deco buildings like the old Sears store and warehouse on Olympic Blvd., the one in Santa Monica, the Griffith Observatory, and the Eastern Columbia building. They are such beautiful buildings and as an engineer I feel sad that I am so busy that I cannot go right now. :/ Also the Urban Lights exhibit with hundreds of lamp posts is kinda cool. One day I have to take a train with my private train car out there from New York. B| B| B|
