To the undergrads reading this, hello! How was your day today? I hope this message finds you all well wherever you are:)

As one of the TAs on this campus, I wanted to urge you to seek help from your TAs and/or professors when you need help as soon as possible. Earlier the better. We are honest when we say we want all the students to do well. If you are not well, whether physically or psychologically, or something is preventing you from submitting assignments on time, etc., reach out to us! We were once undergrads too, and we know that life doesn't always go according to plan. If you need an extension, it never hurts to ask.

With the end of the semester around the corner, I notice that many students are stressed, with multiple deadlines and exams coming up. However, it's often the case that many of those struggling appear to be doing fine on the surface, wearing smiles on their faces, so we are caught in a bind of "should we reach out more actively, or should we keep the student's privacy and keep distance?" If you are uncomfortable, you do not have to share the details. But please, just reach out to us and let us know how we can help you succeed!

Come to our office hours, or email us to set up a time to chat if you cannot come to our office hours. We (at least me and the professors/TAs I work(ed) with) are here to listen and offer support. You are also welcomed to come in just to chat or talk about current events, projects in other classes, etc.! 

You can do it! 

Wishing you all a wonderful dayðŸ˜‰

(If your TA or professor is not supportive, then I'm sorry...but know that there are those of us who genuinely care about students' well-being, and I hope you come across at least one during your semesters here at Cornell!)
