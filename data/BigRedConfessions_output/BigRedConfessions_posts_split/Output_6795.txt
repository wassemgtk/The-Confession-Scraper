ok, so I get that people flake for whatever reason, dates don't pan out, people stop texting, etc. But couldn't a girl who stops texting completely after already agreeing to a date at least have the courtesy to explain that she's no longer interested? It seems rather obvious that this girl in particular is not interested anymore, but i still have this stupid sense of anticipation that won't go away. An explicit severance message would lay all doubt to rest, but I guess I'll just move on.
