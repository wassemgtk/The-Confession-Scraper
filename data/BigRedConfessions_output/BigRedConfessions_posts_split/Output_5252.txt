"When I found out about the murders committed by someone who doesn't even deserve to have his name mentioned, I was horrified. There was a confession earlier about sympathizing with people, and I agree about that, but that comes up to a point. He had a ton of therapists and help already, he was well off financially, and he had people giving him love advice. I don't think he could have gotten any more help. Even if he got some sunshine filled romance, he could have still become a disgruntled pariah, and used another excuse to kill (I seriously doubt romantic love of any kind can overcome any bitter, deep beliefs people have; I wish people would stop encouraging that, especially thinking that romance can heal depression on its own).

 I hate to toss the word ""entitled"" around, but it sounded as if he felt he was entitled to sex without caring about women--enough to KILL PEOPLE. He thought it was an acceptable cause. Are people listening to the same news I am? Do people actually feel sorry for him after hearing about the hate he held that was strong enough to instigate murders? I live near the area where the shootings happened, and I don't feel like going outside much this summer anymore. And I am not going to feel bad for him. Ever. My heart goes out to the people he killed, and their grieving families, but I find it utterly ridiculous that he even gets sympathy, and hearing how fairytale love could have made the difference. No one talks about the victims. I have friends who knew the victims, and none of them seem to know how to deal with this, and I don't know what to do for them. All of the vigils and events intended to comfort the community don't really seem to dissuade the pain and fear. I can't even imagine how the families are coping. Being proximal to all of this, I find very scared and very angry people, but none of them feel sorry for the boy; everyone is busy with their emotions over the innocent people who deserved to have lived out their full lives. I've heard that even the parents feel more sorrow for the victims than their own son. I don't care if I hit a nerve, I don't care if some stupid argument starts on this confession trying to call me stupid or evil, about how if a girl had just given him a chance, but... But hearing about this over and over and over when I can't do anything about it, and no one outside of this community seems to remember the victims for more than two seconds, and are instead giving the dead shooter what he wanted and giving others no reason to not repeat it... I feel really sick. The kid gets to die with his name emblazoned forever, while the victims lost their chance to ever leave their mark on the world--he took away even that chance for them. No one is going to remember them."
