There is this one guy that drives me crazy (in a bad way). He always talks extremely loudly and I have never heard him say anything besides bragging or showing off. I tried to ignore him, but I have been running into him every day. Before the physics test, he was bragging about how well he had done on DiffEq. In physics office hours, he stands around and yells about how easy he found the problems (why are you in office hours if you found the pset so easy???). In dining halls/studying around campus, I hear his grating voice bragging and yelling about random shit. I just can't stand it!!! I'm trying to avoid him, but I can't!
