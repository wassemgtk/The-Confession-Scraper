In light of the decision to combine AEM, Johnson and The Hotel School into one unified College of Business, I cannot express how sad this makes me. Ever since I was five years old I knew I wanted to come to the Hotel School. It has always been my dream to open restaurants, and I knew that the Hotel School was the stepping-stone to make this dream a reality. As a second year Hotelie, I canâ€™t help but feel anger and confusion about this decision. I have become passionate about my home school and the thought of it being absorbed into something so generic and bureaucratic makes me furious. 

With no Hotelie representation within the newly appointed Deans of the College of Business, I am afraid that we will lose the culture and distinction that makes us so special. I am afraid we will become a tiny department within a larger entity that favors finance and marketing classes over wine and culinary classes. Combining the Hotel School, AEM, and Johnson under one umbrella institution will dilute the brands and reputations of each of these amazing Schools.

The Hotel School is the best school in the world for people passionate about hospitality. I have made my best friends here. I have found likeminded people who care about hospitality as much as I do. This decision is a slippery slope to eliminate a program that many people at Cornell and in academia seem to not understand. I have never felt such pride to be a Hotelie and such shame to be a Cornellian. I will continue to fight this decision and continue to speak out against it. I am proud to call myself a #hotelie4life.

Sincerely, 

A Passionate and Concerned Hotelie
