"Neither success nor failure is permanent.
Love is not permanent.
Pain is not permanent.
You just have to keep working for those moments when you think your bliss is unparalleled and might transcend all limitations and last forever. Strive for what and who makes you happen even if it's just for a short amount of time because that short amount of time will be a moment in time that's worth it.
Everything is ephemeral and instead of depressing you, it should empower you.
