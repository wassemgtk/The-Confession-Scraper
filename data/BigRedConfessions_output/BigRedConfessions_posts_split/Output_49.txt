re: #8066
I know there might be something going on between us because I can feel the attraction as well. However, I do not want to be the person who initiates more than half of the conversations or finds excuses to hang out together. I know you're shy, but it won't work out if you don't officially indicate that you want to go out with me. Sometimes I need more than time spending together.
