I love three Art Deco buildings on campus: Mann Library, Day Hall, Thurston, Kimball, and Riley Robb. They remind me of a simple time in American and Cornell history. Oh, and I also love Beaux-Arts Warren Hall. Oh, and not to mention the Industrial style look of Rand Hall. Upson is okay, I mean nothing special since it's only Modern International Style bleh. I like to walk around campus and share my knowledge of building styles by giving students a story of each building and throw out architectural style terms. I don't know what my life has become. :/
