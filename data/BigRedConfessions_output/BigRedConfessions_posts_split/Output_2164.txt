Have you ever listened to a song you used to listen to in the past but stopped? It always brings back this weird nostalgic feeling and I begin to think of how I was in the past. Like if I listen to a song from HS or freshman year of college I start thinking about myself during that time period and how much I've changed....how much I've stayed the same. I know I'm making it sound all romantic and what not, but it's kind of a shitty depressing feeling. I just feel so alone all the time. I want to be a kid again and relive my life. Whenever I think of happy memories I'm almost always depressed because that happy moment has passed. Whenever I think of sad memories I'm also depressed. I just need someone to talk to about my feelings, ya know?

AND DON'T YOU DARE POST A FUCKING PICTURE OF DRAKE.
