I never noticed this before until my friend pointed it out, but this girl I have a crush on looks a lot like my mom--dark skin, dark hair, straight teeth, etc. I am seriously weirded out by this and I don't know what's wrong with me...Is this normal? I really like this girl, but knowing this has discouraged me from asking her out.
