I find it interesting that there is a disproportionate amount of posts from people with a fascination about Indian girls. Those are confessions, but talking like that borders fetishism. Indian girls, you are beautiful, assume it. Guys, don't be losers and post your racial preferences on confessions. Instead, actually talk to those girls, and go beyond their appearance (though it's totally ok to have preferences). Peace.
