I hate it when my social worth to others is evaluated by how much potential utility I become to them. I despise doing that to others too because I like them as who they are. I know I will get snubbed at for claiming that humans have intrinsic values that cannot be measured by any standards. Even if it's true, does it even matter in an environment or a society driven and evaluated by extrinsic success? Success accessed by parameters such as GPA, wealth, number of friends, etc.
