I want to be the kind of girl who's bold enough to make the first move, but I can't get rid of that niggling doubt that maybe I'm spectacularly failing at reading you correctly, and that you don't see me as anything more than a friend. You seem to have so much more experience than I do, and the last thing I want is to completely misconstrue our relationship and end up looking really, really stupid in your eyes.
