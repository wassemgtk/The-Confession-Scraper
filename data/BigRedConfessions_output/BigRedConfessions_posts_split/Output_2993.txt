After this housing bullshit, I've honestly started to wonder why I chose to go to Cornell. My parents pay 60k a year for an Ivy League education (You would think that the administrators would be intelligent enough to actually figure out how to fucking do math (In case you haven't: [total (non shitty) beds - (current students  + transfer students) >> 0) and for everything that a "first degree" institution would offer, but apparently I'm paying for a shitty sophomore year. I know I sound entitled right now but I'd just like to have known that they forgot to include "shit" in their disgrace of "guaranteed sophomore housing."
