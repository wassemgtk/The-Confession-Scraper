I have been away from school for more than six months now (because of depression). I've been alright while I was away but the thought of returning back to school this spring is more than giving me cold feet. One would think I'm not ready to come back to school but I miss cornell and Ithaca so dearly and finally getting to be me (I'm queer which will never be an option in my country) is beyond enticing but.. I keep up a strong front, act like I'm untouchable but I'm so scared, of losing the fight again, giving up under all the pressure and being a loser all over again, a failure, disappoint my teachers, parents and ultimately myself.
