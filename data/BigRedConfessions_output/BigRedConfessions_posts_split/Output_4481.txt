"Even though it was pretty much 2 years since we had first met, I still think about the great times we had together.  It was really great.  I was a freshman and didn't know what I do now.  I still probably don't regret my decision in not talking to you anymore, though.  You told people around me that you had wanted to talk but you never came to me after I had tried to with you once.  You just kept saying I don't know throughout the conversation and it really frustrated me.  You also never say what you think, which is essentially killing of all your character and personality that made me like you in the first place.  And suddenly, I get forced out of my dorm and I haven't seen you since.  I don't really talk to anyone from here much at all, I only hang out with friends that I've had at home now.  

I really feel that you didn't appreciate all the effort I put in caring about you and it still hurts me a lot. A hell of a lot sometimes.  I can deal with it really well a great majority of the time, but sometimes it drives me crazy when I let my thoughts run crazy at night when I don't sleep.  I keep on going back and forth with myself - trying to explain to myself why you acted how you did and why I was THAT much of a sucker to spend so much time giving you attention - either because you're insecure (as everyone is!), or because you wanted more constant attention. You told me once about how you were seeing another guy in high school because you thought he was attractive, and how it was 'short lived'.  And then later in the year you tell one of my sophomore friends that you weren't physically attracted to me, but that my personality was on par with your expectations.  BUT, I never got a chance to really ""see you"" like the other guy did!  It makes you look kinda shallow that you would go for a guy (for even a short period of time) mostly for his looks, and not even give me a chance for my personality....that's so ridiculous imo
 
I wasn't made to spend all of my time and efforts to give you attention that you don't even give me.  You can like anyone you want, and that's fine if you're still torn over someone back at home.  He's obviously a great guy, and better than me, if you loved him.  However, if you don't like me on THAT level, the only other level that I have left with you is that of a friend/acquaintance.  If I'm not happy with our interactions on THIS friend level, I can't salvage our interactions, along with time during the first (and short part) of the second semesters we spent together.  I still don't understand how you would almost ignore me sometimes when I was with you in your room and then you're all frustrated and stressed out after I stopped coming in.  I did a lot of things back then to see how you would react because you're very difficult to read.  After a while, I understood how you piece thoughts and actions together.  I got inside your brain a bit, but I'm not you so it was still really complicated.  I'm not here to play with your emotions.

Save someone else all the pain.  It can still suck, along with all the other stuff that was and still is going on.  It's almost over.  You're kinda selfish and I have a love hate relationship with what you did to me.  Mostly hate now because I was really stupid and didn't know how to protect myself.  Idk if I should ever talk with you again."
