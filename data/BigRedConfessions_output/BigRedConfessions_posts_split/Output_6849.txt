I had a dream that replayed that Friday night and it was perfect. I figured you thought hard about how I was acting and why nothing actually happened. Truth is I'm actually hiding something and you probably know what. I really like you I guess I was just nervous I wanted to give it a second shot but you said you were busy and when I texted you after you never replied soo ya I guess you might not feel the same way about me.
