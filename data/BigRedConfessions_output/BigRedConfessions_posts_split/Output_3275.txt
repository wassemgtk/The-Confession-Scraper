Freshman year I was the guy who thought he could stay with a girl long distance. I would (more nights than not) take my suite mate's guitar and sing for her over FaceTime. Then I'd wake up the next morning before I knew she would just to text good morning and I love you. 

Much much later, I've finally decided to actually start looking again, so single ladies, where y'all at? Now I want someone to sing to in person :)
