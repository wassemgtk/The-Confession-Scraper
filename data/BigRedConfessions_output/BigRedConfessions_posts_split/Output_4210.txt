"The other day, I thought I almost saw you. Excitement ran through my whole body, until it was crushed as I saw the face. She was your height, and had similar hair, and from a distance, I could swear she looked just like you. But the closer I got, the more the differences jumped out at me. A rage surged through me as I realized it wasn't you. And I just realized that this wasn't a rare occurrence. Every time I see an image of you, an intense anger flows from my chest, to my fist as they automatically clench, as if they had a mind of their own. Let me clarify, I am not angry at you. Your beauty in person creates an sensation best described as a freeing bliss. I am never afraid to be me around you, and I love that about our relationship. When I speak to others, its always so calculating, always from the brain. But with you, its from the soul. And your beautiful personality, so unique, so amazing, so strong, so caring. You have never given me a reason to be angry at you. This anger I am feeling is directed at myself. I am still dealing with how I feel for you. I am happy that at least I am stable. But I am far from good. I am constantly trying to find distractions, because when ever I find any free time, you seem to dance your way into my mind. So seamlessly and fluid, as if it was meant to be. But I am in a never ending battle between my emotions, feelings at a level of intensity that I haven't felt since I had my first kiss to the one who taught me that love was a reality, and not just some odd concept, and my head, always so logical. I want nothing but you, but there is a part of me feeling like it's a waste of time. It ask me whether you are really worth the excitement and feeling of having someone else in my life? I questions are you, who is so great, really worth it all? It questions whether you are even as good as I clearly know myself you to be. Its like an intense river, trying to erode the solid image of you in order to create a vast cavern between me, you and possibility something great. But then again, my brain has always questioned its choices, never truly happy with decisions its made, and never truly happy when it with changes when my will folds. And now the worst question comes to mind. Do I even deserve a chance? Because I am far more indecisive than I let the world see. I want you with all my heart in one second, and then next I could be admiring the form of another, imagining myself defiling another human being, and wanting nothing else but that moment of pleasure and another notch in my belt. I know that I don't want anyone else emotionally, and that's more than I could say for the last decade of my life. But half of me fears that lust is just a part of me. It's in my family history, and while I want to do better than the men before me, I can't say I have the best will power. This anger that builds up, it truly stems from the weaknesses and deformities in my character that I don't believe anyone should have to deal with. I am always chasing an image of what I want to be, but I am just not there. But even if achieve my ideal self, is it even good enough for you? This anger that builds it, it is an attempt to destroy myself, because deep down, I wonder if what I am and what I want to be -something I have desired since I was 13, walking home from school with a person who I once called my best friend, as I saw he deformed into something that I didn't know if I could ever associate myself with, but accepted that I was from perfect myself - is good enough for you. Honestly two years ago I was stable, it was insane. I walked around with the mentality that either you could handle me, or just simply fuck off. The idea of changing for someone else, especially for a significant other, was insane. I never worried If I was good enough for someone else, because that wasn't my priority. My priorities were to achieve something bigger than anything else in my life. But now I look at you, and wonder if I should smooth down those rough edges(more like impaling spikes) in order to give you someone that might be better for you. Maybe I should be a better man for you. But is it truly being a better man? Would it be me? Which is something that's so important to me. But then again, is trying to become this ideal self really being me? In the end of the day, are any of these choices what you would really want, and who am I to decide what you want?
TL;DR 
When you cross my mind, you remind me that no matter how hard I try, I'll never have the right answer, and nothing enfuriates me than a question I can't answer and a decision I can't make, because it remind me of all my flaws, and nothing sets me back more than that. So the only thing I can do is push you out of my brain and just go with the current plan, since all I can do is stick with Plan A. 
TL;DR the TL;DR
The thought of you stresses me out about my life choices to the point that I want to punch myself, but I just end up a little less confidently in the same direction prior to this all.
