Today, I got my resume back in one of my classes. I got a terrible grade on it. That very same resume got me my summer internship with one of the most prestigious companies in my field. Moral of the story is, your low grades aren't holding me back and I won't get caught up in feeling down just because i'm below average at one of the best schools in the world. I'm gonna succeed, good GPA or not.
