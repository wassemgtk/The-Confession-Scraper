I wanted to beat the fuck out of so many fucktards today. Do you monkeys know what courtesy is? for every piece of shit that pushed me, I wanted to give them a punch in the face. Man... woman... creature... ghosts... I clearly don't give a fuck. Like Ludacris was saying... Move bitch. Get out the way... Get out the way... Bitch get out the way... Cuz a fight might be out and i could definitely punch your lights out.
