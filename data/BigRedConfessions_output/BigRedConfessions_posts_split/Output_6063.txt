Fuck all the people I meet outside of Cornell who impose whatever unrealistic expectations of what someone in the Ivy League is supposed to be on me. Like, I'm literally just as stupid as everyone else, first off. But then it feels like *anytime* I slip up, it's seen as 10x worse because being in the Ivy League apparently means being flawless all the time. It's honestly exhausting and I'm scared that this Cornell stigma will follow me the rest of my career.
