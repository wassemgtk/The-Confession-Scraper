You may be the most intelligent and beautiful person I've ever known, but I have to let you go. You've changed so much in the last year that it's like my friend isn't even there any more, and the person that's replaced you isn't nearly as friendly or pleasant to be around. I'm worried that something must have happened to you in order to have caused this change, but I don't feel like I know you well enough to ask. Now, whenever I speak to you I'm reminded of that and I get a little sad. I know that you read Cornell Confessions sometimes, but I doubt that you'll know who I am even if you did read this. I'm only sorry that we couldn't have been better friends. Goodbye, and I hope that you're doing alright. Good luck on finals.
