"every single one of my closest friends has been in a serious relationship for a long time, and most have also had a best friend for years. when i'm alone and sad, i have no one to talk to about it because they wouldn't understand the extent of loneliness that comes with never having anyone that'll truly always be there.
this only makes things worse."
