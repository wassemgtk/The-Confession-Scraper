A Dragon Day Shirt Purchase:

That's all it takes. One tiny, tiny, irrelevant event. Then, without warning, I'm hooked.

I'm sorry pretty lady. Sorry that I only had to buy a shirt from you. 

Well, it wasn't just the shirt. 

At the time, I had looked upon the thirsty pack of dogs that were my friends, all of whom were also vying for your attention, and then I had looked upon your face. Immediately, I knew what you knew: shirts were not why my friends had stuck around and listened to your sales pitch. 

"Why add to her misery," I thought to myself. So I decided to actually buy a shirt, maintaining my business-like, disinterested, almost asexual persona. This demeanor serves me well and keeps me safe from myself, specifically my propensity for outlandish and inexplicable infatuation. And it worked. I forgot about you quite easily, at least for a while.

Then, weeks later, we locked eyes on the slope. You were inebriated, so far as I could tell, a gorgeous freshman Archie enjoying her first Slope Day. And here is where the true apology comes.

You wouldn't remember, but you smiled (or gushed, or blushed, or some combination of the 3), pointed at my shirt and yelled "Dragon!!" 

Sweet, but meaningless, in the end. Just a subconscious recognition and drunken shout. 

Still, that's all it takes for me. I caught a crush, one that I'm sure will be gone as quickly as it arrived. For the moment, though, it's here. I'm sorry, for I know the pain I can cause. I'm sorry that you had to ever come into contact with me and become an unwilling object of unwanted affection. Desire is cruel to both parties.

Fortunately for both of us, the chances of me pursuing you are almost nonexistent, due to...shall we say...logistics, to put it simply. Hahaha.

I fall in love easily, even though I know that I have never been in love. In other words, I willingly allow infatuation to overcome me on a regular basis. My friends find this hilarious, and--despite my constant failed endeavors--so do I. Like a psychopath who absolutely refuses to understand morality and thus redeem himself or herself, I absolutely refuse to learn from my mistakes. I laugh them off with ease.

Yet, interestingly enough, when I commit myself to being my normal self, I am extremely successful. People, even attractive women, love me, as long as there is no emotion on the line. Only when I commit myself to being attracted to someone do I make the most hilarious (or horrendous, depending on your point of view) mistakes.

It's a strange, seemingly inevitable paradox that comes with being me.

Anyway, be glad you've escaped some particularly cringe-worthy interactions/experiences. So many others have fallen prey to my stupidity, ill-advised decisions, Facebook messages (oh the Facebook messages, don't even get me started,) cowardly/ambiguous texts, awkwardly handled friendships, and more and more and more and worse and worse and worse.

Be glad, pretty lady, that you have escaped. Enjoy your Summer. Oh, and one more thing:

DRAGON!! :) :) :)
