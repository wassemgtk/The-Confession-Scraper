One thing I promised myself I would do is to never compare myself to others when I entered Cornell.  I lied.  Everyday I always compared my GPA to my business friends and my success to my engineering friends in finding internships.  And it would always make me feel terrible about myself and how I am not doing well.  It is hard always knowing that maybe you could have done better if you spent less time on the laptop and more time doing this and that.  So, I have decided to accept myself for who I am.  Hopefully that will make next semester a lot easier.
