"My boyfriend is a really nice guy but..he's not good looking. He is not repulsive but he is not very attractive either. And he makes no effort to dress well or try to look better. My friends are too nice to say it but I know they all think I can do better.
I was attracted to his personality and so I said yes to him. But I find myself increasingly comparing him to my friends' boyfriends these days. And our sex life is practically non-existent. He wants it I know, but I always find excuses.
It feels bad thinking of him like this because he goes out of his way to make me happy. He genuinely cares for me and loves me. And I love him too, I But maybe it's not in the same way anymore. I would be very upset to see him with anyone else or if we stopped talking but it would get better with time right? I think I'm only with him because he has never given me a reason not to be. Because it's easier than breaking up, and nice to have in a big place like Cornell. What should I do? Is this just a slow phase or should I get out of this..
