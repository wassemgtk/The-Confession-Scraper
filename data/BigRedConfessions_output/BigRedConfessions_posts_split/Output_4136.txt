For once I just want someone to be interested in me first. 
I want to be asked out on a date without really suspecting it. I want someone else to make the first move. To chase me instead of me chasing them. 
And I know that for that to happen I first need to focus on myself and then someone will come along. But damn I just want a boyfriend I can cook/bake for when I feel like or we can play video games and be stupid and weird, but still go out and party occasionally or stay in and smoke some weed and have crazy intense sex.  
I guess I'll just focus on me and join some clubs and have fun for now.
