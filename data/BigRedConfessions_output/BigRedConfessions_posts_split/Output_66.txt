I'm a Junior gov/econ double major in A&S and I'm freaking out because I haven't taken any language or science requirements and I can't see any way to finish them in the next two semesters on top of finishing up other requirements. I'm so so so scared they're going to kick me out if I can't finish my requirements by spring :( What do I do? I have never heard of anyone staying as a super senior to finish up requirements and my advising deans are pressuring me to stay this summer, but I really don't want to give up an internship I already have. Help!
