If you don't like to be around me, please just let me know. I'd rather have a direct and blunt answer rather than a sense of false hope that I might actually be a likable person with friends. Don't worry about hurting me: I'll be okay. I've dealt with this before so its something I'm used to by now. If you want me to leave you alone, I will, and that will be the end of it.
