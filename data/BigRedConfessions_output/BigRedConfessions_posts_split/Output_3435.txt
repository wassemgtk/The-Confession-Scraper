"Come to Cornhell, they said" . I guess they were always right.

Cornell is truly an example of "Anything is possible".  There is nothing like paying $2400 a year for a Student Insurance you never use and when you finally find your way around to not pay for the student insurance (getting another low-cost insurance with similar coverage), BOOM, they come with a Student Health fee for non-holders of SHIP. In a couple of years, we will be charged for internet per MB and electricity bills in the dorms.
