I don't know how to tell professors that I need serious help in their classes without having a complete and utter breakdown in front of them. And I hate doing that being crying makes me feel so shitty and it's like I'm guilting them into giving me extra time/incompletes in classes that I never finish/extra credit/whatever and I hate that so much but somehow I've made it to senior year without ever really figuring anything out.
