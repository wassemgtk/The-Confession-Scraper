I don't know how to tell you I love you.
We've only been dating a few months now, but I've cherished every moment we've spent together.
It's harder to say goodbye every time I have to leave even though I know I'll see you again really soon.
You're an amazing person and I think we only better each other the more time we spend together :)

I will say it soon...I just don't know how and when yet
