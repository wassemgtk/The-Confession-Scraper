During my senior year of high school, my dad told me he wanted me to write a screenplay of a movie idea he came up with.  We were in the car on our way back to my boarding school and he was telling me about the plot, but I wasn't really paying attention.  I had other things on my mind.  

Anyway, a couple months ago I gave up on a bunch of other things in my life and decided to write that screenplay just to take my mind off of everything.  I'd call home to talk to my dad about it and he would go on for a couple hours.  This would happen once or twice a week.  Anyway, he died last month and I'm stuck on one of the minor character details and I've been calling his cell phone every now and then to talk to him, even though I know he won't pick up.  It's just nice to hear his voice as I write.
