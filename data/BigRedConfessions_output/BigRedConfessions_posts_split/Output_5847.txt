I know we haven't been together since last year but there is a line that you don't cross talking to roommates/best friends. I wouldn't text your roommates about meeting up to go out, so don't text mine. They don't want to see you they want to see your friends and feel sorry for you. If you wouldn't want me to say the things you say to your friends don't say them to mine.
