Responding to the girl who posted that my 1950's Eisenhower post was fake. I graduated in 1955, after starting an engineering program in Mechanical Engineering in 1950 (since the programs back then were 5 years for a Bachelor of Engineering Degree as opposed to the 4 years for a Bachelor of Science Degree today). My wife and I got married two weeks after our graduation, since she started in 1951 at the Home Economics college. So instead of calling me a liar, maybe you should stop doing drugs or alcohol, and start focusing on improving your basic mathematics skills. It's basic arithmetic, and you did not use logic to outcome for the different possibilities. Anyways I hope God has mercy on your soul and blesses you with the best of intentions, before you accuse anyone of being a liar. That is the last thing I would be since I am quite religious. I wish to remain anonymous because I do not want to point out my last name, as my granddaughter goes by the same name and I do not want to embarrass her or have students attack her for her strong conservative family values. God bless!
