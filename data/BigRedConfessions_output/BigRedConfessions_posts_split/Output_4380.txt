The following words capture my low opinion of my heritage: I just hate my ethnic family background. Everybody that I know is related to someone special or famous in history. I've got white friends who claim to be descendants of Charlemagne, George III, and  Warren Buffett, Chinese friends who claim to be related to Mao, Qin Shi Huang, Jackie Chan,  Mongolian and Turkish friends who claim descent from Genghis and Osman, black friends who say they're related to T'oussant L'overture, Sundeita Keita and Evander Holyfield, Indian friends who just say: Akbar. Ashoka. Gandhi. 'nuff said. and Latino friends who say they're descended from BOTH Montezuma AND Hernan Cortes. The fact is all these people have such noble and great bloodlines. Me? I come from the cultural backwaters of a people who've basically stayed in one place since the Stone Age. All you'll find in my ancestry is a bunch of nose-picking, ass-scratchers. I feel so...humiliated when people ask me my ethnicity...a bunch of no-names. All I've inherited from them is a small penis. Thanks ancestors. You're the best. smh...
