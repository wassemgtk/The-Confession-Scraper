What am I supposed to do with my life? My feelings are all messed up right now. I can't stop thinking about a girl who already said she doesn't want to be in a relationship right now, and it's really starting to make me depressed. Even though deep down inside I know this is wrong, I can't help but get super jealous when she's hanging around her other guy friends and having a great time. I can't deal with this anymore - how about I supposed to get my emotions back in control?
