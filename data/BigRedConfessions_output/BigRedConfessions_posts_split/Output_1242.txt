When I was 5 my 9 year old brother told me I was adopted. I believed him at the time because both of my parents are white and I'm black. My parents never bothered telling me since I'm light enough to pass for a light colored mixed race person. But I found out that my aunt is actually my real mom and had me when I was in college. I'm so happy that I'm related to my family. But as it turns out, my older brother is ACTUALLY adopted. His biological parents are Korean! WTF?!
