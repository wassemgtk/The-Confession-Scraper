I really wished I had kissed you this weekend. But I couldn't because then it would all flood back. The memories, the feelings of weirdness, the constant daydreams. I know that it was better that I didn't kiss you but it was almost there. All I had to do was lean in an inch closer. I didn't only to protect myself and to prevent from getting swept up in the storm of your love again. Kissing your friend is not easy and neither is liking them.
