I just realized that CMS is the coldest, most impersonal system ever designed because it severs the connection among students and between students and TAs/Professors. My complaint is that it is too streamlined and efficient, and I admit mine is a very subjective judgement and I'm sure the system exists for very good reasons. However, I still miss that time when I am in a small class (and by this I mean <200 students), I hand in my handwritten homework to my TAs and they would give back handwritten corrections and say things to you face-to-face. When getting back the homework I would discuss them with my neighbors, who also just got back their homework. If I forgot to bring my homework to class, I would just turn it in during OH, which is also a good chance to talk to people. But CMS shuts me out. I'm deeply disappointed. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying we should get rid of it or anything, but we need to think about how technology can change our lives in unexpected ways.
