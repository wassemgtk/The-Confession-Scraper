Now that I graduated from Cornell last year, I have moved to a state where I can conceal carry and exercise my 2nd amendment rights. I even conceal carry to work for the safety of myself and my coworkers. I don't miss NY one bit, where I was disarmed by the mostly corrupt politicians for the convenience of criminals who will always get their firearms illegally.
