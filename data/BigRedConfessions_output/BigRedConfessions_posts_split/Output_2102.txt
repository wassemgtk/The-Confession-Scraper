So being single is rough. I've learnt that. I'm trying, it's just tough. I have trouble finding the boundary between creepy/friendly and assertive/aggressive. Especially when it's girls in the same social circle.

So, despite loving a relationship and having an intimate physical and emotional connection, I think I might need to be single for a while, and be comfortable enough in my own skin and truly love myself before I can get serious with someone else. I don't like this idea, which I think means that it's the right one. I hope that makes sense.
