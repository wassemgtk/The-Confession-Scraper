"So here's the skinny. I was coming in from a good run in the wee hours of the morning and after some cardio, I want to grab some grub before showering and heading out to a 9 AM class (torture, I know). So there I am, minding my own business, looking down at my wonderful, tasteless bowl of corn flakes and milk at some ungodly hour of the morning, and I'm the only person in the dining hall... OR SO I THOUGHT. Some sweet girl walks by, asks me if I want a nice white flower, and murmurs ""yay!"" when I accept. Very nice gesture, and it definitely brightened up my morning, since someone noticed me for once!

I couldn't just hold onto all that happiness selfishly, and it's a Friday, so I decide ""what the hey"" and pay it forward. Flash forward to 2 PM in Duffield, and I'm still holding onto said flower after three hours of classes, lunch, and a few more hours of work. I finally work up the courage to pass it on, and decide to pick a table at random. Two very wonderful girls are sitting there, and I tell them an abridged version of this story and ask if they could do me a favor and pass it on. They kind of looked at me a little weirdly (I'm guessing it did sound a bit strange), but smiled and said sure.

When I walked by their table again a few minutes later, I noticed that the flower was gone. I smiled. I'm glad I was able to bring someone else some sense of happiness, even if only ephemeral. However, while I'm happy I was able to give other people some ephemeral sense of happiness, what I really wanted was to give the flower to somebody special. I couldn't work up the courage despite the divine intervention that strangely bestowed the flower upon me that very morning, so here I am, still feeling kind of empty that I don't have the balls to do it. I wonder where that flower is now..."
