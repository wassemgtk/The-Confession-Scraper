"Whoever it is that keeps telling girls that they shouldn't make the first move, please stop that. Any reasonable guy would be flattered to have someone interested in them, and if someone reacts poorly to an expressed interest (man or woman), then they're either caught off guard, cripplingly socially awkward at turning someone down, or not even worth the time spent talking with them. There's nothing to be afraid about hearing the word ""no.""

I'm an average to bad looking guy - probably about a 5 now, unless I spend more time and money working out and getting better fitting clothes. I've been outright rejected (usually nicely), I've gone on dates that didn't go anywhere, I've had a few short term hookups, and I've had one long and very satisfying relationship that helped me out of bad times (and I certainly hope that I had helped her, too). The last of those only happened because she initiated it and was very clear about wanting to try something more than friends, and while we're not still together, that was the best and most intimate relationships that I've had with anyone. I only regret that we had to go our separate ways and won't be getting back together for reasons specific to our situation.

Now I've taken time for myself and I'm working on my own physical image - hell, if I don't respect myself, then who will? And now I'm fine with being single, because the person that I'm looking for doesn't have to be exceptionally beautiful or intelligent - she just has to have a personality that works well with mine and she has to have the balls to make the first move. That's the sort of confidence that I love and live for - I know that I'm not the only guy or girl that thinks like this, so if you're still reading this and you find that there's someone you can't stop thinking about, then surprise yourself and take a risk. After all, what's the worst that can happen?"
