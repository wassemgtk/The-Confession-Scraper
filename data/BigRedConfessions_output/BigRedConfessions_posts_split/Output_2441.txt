This may sound digusting but everytime I make 💩💩💩💩, wash my hands, or take a shower, I think about how I am providing a nutritious meal, of coliforms, fats, sweat, and oils, to bacteria most likely of the species Nitrobacter, and how they are gobbling it up to make an inert nutritious cake that could be spread over farmland or landfilled. 😎🐤🐤🐤🐤🐙🐙🐙
