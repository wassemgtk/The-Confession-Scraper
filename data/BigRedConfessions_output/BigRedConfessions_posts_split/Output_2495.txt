I've watched the House of Cards 5 times over and now starting my sixth season 1. I'm thinking in Frank's voice, I'm dreaming in Frank's voice, and even talk to myself with a thick Southern accent. Whenever I face a tough choice, Frank breaks the fourth wall to help me make the decision.

That's right, people. I have my very own inner Frank Underwood.
