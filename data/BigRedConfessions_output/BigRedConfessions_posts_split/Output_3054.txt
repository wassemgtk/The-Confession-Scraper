I am a senior in high school admitted to Cornell class of 2019 through ED. I am suffering from a bad case of senioritis and I can't fight it. I am obsessing over Cornell and spend hours at end just browsing dining hall menus. Pathetic, I know. I am excited to come to Cornell and meet so many awesome people, but at the same time I am afraid of not being as awesome as them and not fitting in.
