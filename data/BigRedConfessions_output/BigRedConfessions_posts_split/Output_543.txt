I love taking walks at night around campus. I often go to the walkway behind uris library, the side facing the slope, and stare at the lights. I find myself thinking about gatsby staring at the green light. I am by no means gatsby nor do I have a "Daisy", literal or figurative. It's just fun to think about that part of the book/scene in my head.
