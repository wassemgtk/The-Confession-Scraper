To the creepy junior CS major who has an obsession with Asian girls, please stop. They do not approve. Please stop preying on them and then when they inevitably turn you down, please do not act all high and mighty. You are trying to date them regardless of their interest level and availability. Damn boy, stop being so thirsty.
