I absolutely hate it when people talk about "Team light-skin" and "Team Dark-skin" within the black community. As though I don't have to put up with enough prejudice as a black women, you have the audacity to try and put me against people of my own race? How dare you!? Love the skin you're in. Be proud of it. But don't you dare split us into groups as though we aren't equals. Remember that just 50 years ago people like us, no matter how you light you think you are, had to fight the same fight. We shouldn't separate our differences so brashly, especially with something as frivolous as complexion.
