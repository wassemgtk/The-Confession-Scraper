I only just heard about the Isla Vista killings. As a mixed race student, is it bad that I can understand his grievances? Not at all that his actions were justified, but I can understand how he ended up with his beliefs. He was unable to live with the kind of discrimination I've learned to deal with, but it's sad. Both for the victims and Elliot Rodger. Dear white people, end racism- it isn't good for any of us. This is both a message to the Cornell community, which is inherently racist, and white people as a whole.
