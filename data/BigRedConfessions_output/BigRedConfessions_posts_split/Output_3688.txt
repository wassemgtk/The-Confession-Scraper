Why are there so many confessions on this page saying things like (paraphrasing) "I avoid you because I like you and I don't know how you feel about me"?

In what world does that even remotely make sense!? What sort of message do you think avoiding someone says about how you feel about them? Certainly not that you like them, or even remotely care about their company.
