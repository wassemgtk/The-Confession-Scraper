The mayor of Ithaca is crazy for allowing refuges to come to Ithaca in the future. I hope he doesn't mind housing them in his tiny apartment. He's a typical leftist that has no world view of politics and is a total ignoramus. The only reason he was elected was because of the total leftist bias in student and faculty vote at Cornell. I would definitely not vote for a loser like him. He makes me embarrassed to be a Cornellian just like Cornell's media relations team.
