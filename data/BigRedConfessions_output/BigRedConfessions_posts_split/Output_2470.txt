Im a freshman and I have been in a this relationship for little over 2 month and already Im starting to loss interest. First of all she's too comfortable with me, puts no effort to look good when she sees me. Second, I just dont feel that tingling feeling of love and happiness inside when Im with her. Its just dull. But we have same friend groups so its also bothersome to break up with her. What should I do?
