Now each face is burned into my memory and my obsession with your perception will not go away. And this wouldn’t bother me if you were alone, but you are one among thousands. You are either one I know, and I couldn’t show you exactly what you needed to see in full, or you are one I don’t, and I will never get to show you anything at all or know your story while still staring at my reflection in the mirrors that have replaced your eyes. I’m done with your eyes, done completely with yours and yours and yours. All I see is myself now, and it’s not the self I am but the self you’ve made me to be. I’m sick of this constant façade. It is as if I might as well be looking at mirrors instead of people, in them is reflected all of my sadness, paranoia, anger, self-awareness, obsession and pain. Their twisted perception and ruthless apathy manifested in every gaze.

Goddamnit, why did you have to steal me away from me?
