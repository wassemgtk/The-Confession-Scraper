"2-3 days after every first date, I either get the ""did not feel a connection between us"", the ""I don't see us together""/""I can only see myself being friends with you"", the ""sorry I'm just really busy these days for so-and-so reason, the ""you're great, but I'm not looking to date right now"" (which actually makes no sense because you went on a date), some version of ""bad timing"", no response, or in 3% of cases I get a second date and after that I get one of those responses.

And it really is because I have crippling anxiety and I am not myself the first few times I meet someone, especially if I really like them. And 90% of the girls I go out with I really like... maybe because I've never been given a chance and the loneliness has lowered my standards. I wish they wouldn't agree to go out with me in the first place, but weirdly I must have just enough appeal to warrant a 1st date, but not nearly enough to warrant anything else. And that happening consistently over no less than 100  dates will really wear you down. Guys, if you're getting rejected at the asking out stage, be thankful. After you've gone out and you've developed a crush and you've entered the hope zone, it'll make you much sadder to get one of those texts. To see someone go from trying and seeming to have an interest to completely discarding you like a stick of gum hurts. I wish people would give second chances, but alas 99% of the population seems to think they can fully gauge someone's dating potential and compatibility after an hour-long conversation where neither person is really themselves.

I actually have no idea what it would be like to have someone maintain interest. I see people together and I wonder what the heck they did that I'm not doing. And among their numbers are hordes of blithering idiots, a lot of whom I see with women I'd tried to get in the sweetest and smartest possible way. One thing I always get is ""you're really great, but..."". Nice guys finish last. I cannot emphasize how true that is. And it's just as true for intellectual Cornellians that you'd think would appreciate a good brain and a good heart."
