"I've been hating myself for the last couple of years. You are the first person to make me slightly believe in myself. I've been falling for you ever since we met yet I'm so afraid of what this attachment may bring. I can see that you're weary too. I just wish you'd speak out first because this is getting so fucking painful. I'm breaking down with nothing stable to rely on.

I love your laughter and that certain way you glance at me. I feel as if my mind needs your touch as a fuel. I'm trapped in this whirlwind of emotions yet I have no idea how you feel for me.

I just want you to read this and believe that this is about you and come to me with open arms and tell me that you want to trust me. "
