Suppressing my feelings for you has been one of the hardest things I have had to do. I am aware of the age gap between us, but I could not help feeling the way I did. I fell in love with your intelligence, and ambition to chase after the things you were passionate about, but the barriers between us seem too difficult to overcome. It is best for me to move on, but after our brief, unexpected encounter, all the feelings I tried hiding resurfaced. It is even harder knowing we will be spending our summers in the same location, but my instincts tell me this is not the right relationship to pursue. To the one who gets you in the end, you are a lucky one.
