Alright gentlemen who are going to graduate in the spring. If you are in a relationship, now is the time to talk about where the relationship could go after graduation. I know alot can happen in spring sem and plans change, but trust me when I say waiting till the last minute is never good. At least start the conversation before winter break. That is all!
