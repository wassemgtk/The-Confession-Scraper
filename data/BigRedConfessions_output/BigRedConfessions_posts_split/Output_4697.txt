I used to be a lonely skinny nerd. Then I started working out 2 hours a day and following a strict diet. I've put on 35 pounds in 2 years and I feel like Superman. I am still a lonely friendless virgin and will most likely die one. But it's an amazing feeling to swing all of this lean mass around and have people look at you as if you're someone. People are so primal it's amazing, I never thought muscles would make such a tremendous difference in the way I was perceived. I am still weird as heck and will never have a social life. But the confidence that comes with having a great body mitigates some of the sadness that is seeing happy young people laughing together and having a good time and knowing you can never be like them. I recommend working out for depression, you'll see progress and you'll feel amazing. Maybe one day I'll beat one of the frat boys senseless for fun. Strength is the great equalizer.
