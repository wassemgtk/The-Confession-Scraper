I'm here at Cornell on a full scholarship from my government. I'm the first woman in my family studying abroad. I'm the first person in my family and school studying at an Ivy League University. The pressure to do well on me is tremendous because so many eyes are looking at me. And yet here I am, depressed, constantly tired, and barely holding it together. I don't know how to get out of this cycle. I'm so not cut out for this.
