I've never had a lifelong friend. All t[h]e friends I've ever made back at home I've ended up pushing away some how. I thought coming to college would be different, and I have people I consider friends, but no one I've really gotten close to. I want to create stronger bonds with people but I'm afraid that everyone is getting annoyed with me. I don't know what's wrong with me or how to do this better. I just want to know what it's like to have a friend that needs me and wants to talk to me just as much as I need them.
