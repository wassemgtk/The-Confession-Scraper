Exceptionally handsome and talented, built, sailing,  (Asian or part Asian?) theatre man...yes you're all of those things and you clearly seem to be an extremely genuine and kind person. The poise and devotion you portray on stage gives me chills. I'm sure there are many, many females that admire you out there..but this is just me appreciating that you seem like a phenomenal person in general. I hope you make whoever you end up being with a very, very happy person because they are going to be so lucky to have you by their side.
