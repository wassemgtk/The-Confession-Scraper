"You're one of the must toxic people I've ever met, and yet you're super convinced that the people around you are toxic, and that you have to get them out of your life asap.

I know you must be suffering, but from the way you deal with it, it's obviously at least 70% your doing, because you just spend your life milking it and not doing anything to improve it."
