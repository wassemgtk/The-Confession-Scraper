I'm pretty sure I've never truly connected with another human being. Sure, I'm good at making people laugh, or imitating them, faking emotions, but I don't think anyone has ever truly understood me. I hear people talk about their best friends, their girlfriends, their siblings, their parents and I've never had a relationship like they've described. Twice in my life, I've completely cut myself off from a group of people, burning all bridges. I felt nothing, no missing, no sadness for the loss of friends. People have died, moved away, broken up with me, been dumped by me, and I've never felt any real sadness. I feel a twinge of guilt from not missing them, and then nothing. If my parents were to die tomorrow, I can't say that I would be terribly sad. I like to think I would miss them, but I don't know.

 If I never saw anyone I've ever met again, I can't say that I would be that much different. Honestly, the inconvenience of building new relationships would be the worst thing for me, but that's all it would be. An inconvenience. I read books about love, companionship, compassion for fellow man, but I can't bring myself to feel it. Hell, I've had this conversation with a few people, even doctors, and they all just nod along with it. They just listen, not contribute, not problem solve, just sit there like a sponge, absorbing the information, waiting to get back to their significant other, to their spouse, their buddy, their child, their friend. I know this is a long post, and most people won't read it, so to those of you that read along, thanks, I guess.
