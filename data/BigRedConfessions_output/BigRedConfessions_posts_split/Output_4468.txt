IPD: ""We received a noise complaint"" Me: ""We've had our music off since 12am"". IPD: ""We filed the complaint, for loud voices. We're going to arrest you if you keep talking.""
- Collegetown, 1am

This is utterly ridiculous. Myself and a friend were ordered to enter the police car and were interrogated both together and separately, with multiple threats of arrest if we tried to defend ourselves. This is a shame on the IPD, with less than 25 people in the house and no alcohol left on the premises.
