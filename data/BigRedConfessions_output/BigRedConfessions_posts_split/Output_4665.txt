It's Friday night. I'm not out and partying. I'm in my room. Thinking. Reminiscing on how a few months ago, on a night like this, you and I would have ordered food, cuddled up in my bed, and picked a movie after 30mins of indecisiveness. . . Too bad your indecisiveness wasn't limited to movie-picking only. . .
