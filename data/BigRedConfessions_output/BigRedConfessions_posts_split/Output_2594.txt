Dear Confessions page,

All of these posts about privilege, racism, classism, ableism, sexism, etc. are just stupid on here. Yes, there is inequality in the United States, but just because someone is, say, a white heteronormative male doesn't mean they have no place in a discussion, similarly just because one is, say, a handicapped african-american pansexual genderqueer mermaid-kin (yes tumblr, i know) doesn't mean they have the most important or well-informed say in a discussion either. There is more to a person and their intelligence or knowledge than the color of their skin, their family's financial status, their gender, etc. As soon as you reduce things to strictly appearance, as so many of you seem to do, you make your argument seem even worse and make people, who may have good ideas/thoughts on the matter, shut you out.

Sincerely,
Someone who is sick of this shit getting in the way of productive discourse
