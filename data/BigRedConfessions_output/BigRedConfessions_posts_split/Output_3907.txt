It’s been almost three months now since you told me, but the pain still resides. I’ve been trying to get over it and forget you, I really have, but sometimes in the middle of the day while I’m doing my work, your words just float into my head and I find myself on the verge of breaking down. I’m trying to be a man about this and not cry or feel sadness, but some days I just can’t hold my emotions back. I’m trying my hardest to move on, but this wound is just too deep. I have goals and dreams and I’m trying to focus on them, but the truth is, this really has made me depressed. One day I’ll get over this, and then maybe I can finally trust someone again. For now, I’ll just keep fighting, one day at a time.
