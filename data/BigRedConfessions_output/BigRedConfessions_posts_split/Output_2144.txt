Yea we're not the best college, yet I'm still disappointed at what happened in the past few weeks - the recent racist yelling towards minority students, drunk people having lots of fun by dropping a beer bottle towards someone walking his dog under bridge, etc. I don't know. I even feel some kids are so proud of being jerks and snobs on this campus. So broken. So naive. I'm tired - not because of my school workload, but the fact that I have to see these annoying people now and then on this campus. I truly need a break from all these high school minded kids, and I can't wait to graduate. People keep telling me there're people like this everywhere, but I honestly never saw them during my summer internship. Yea we're not the most selective college, and why should I expect anything better? Should have worked harder in high school and attended somewhere else better.
