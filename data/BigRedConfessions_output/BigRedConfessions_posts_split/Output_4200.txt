I know people are going through things and use Cornell Confessions to vent their feelings, but I find it a little upsetting that whenever I want to help one of them by offering to talk to them, they never reply. I understand that people may not feel comfortable talking to a random stranger. But at the same time, i find it a bit odd that people go to random strangers who are "professionals". They are there to tell you that you'll be fine and ask you to reiterate your feelings by doing circular questioning for a sum or something to fill their resumes. But those who do it for neither reason, end up losing sight of what compassion is. I think it's better to go to a stranger who isn't a professional instead because they are truly the ones who listen. Responses may not always be positive. But yeah, please don't leave us strangers hanging when we offer to talk, please.
