I really like this guy in one of my classes. I'm really shy and I've never said more than a few words to him. I feel like I'm back in middle school and it's so embarrassing. I keep hoping he might realize and make a move, because I freeze up any time I even thinking about doing so myself. I feel so stupid for being so weak.
