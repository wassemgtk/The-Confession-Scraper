I really do feel like Cornell is an environment where difference of opinion isn't tolerated. As a conservative, I feel labeled as stupid and ignorant when I try and communicate my opinion. Even outside of conversation, it feels like people look at me differently, like I'm some evil person for having the beliefs that I do. We as a student body need to be more tolerant and respectful of others who share different viewpoints.
