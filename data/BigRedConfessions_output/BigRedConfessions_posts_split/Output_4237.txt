To the person that I was exchanging looks with at Rose yesterday, I find you incredibly attractive. I couldn't tell if you were looking because you felt the same or because it was of disgust. If it was the former, please say something to me. You looked really busy and I didn't want to interrupt. So next time we see each other, say something and hopefully we can see where it goes.
