there is a transgender woman on campus that has mastered make up and female hair styles. after 20something years you think I might get it, but nope. I envy you girl, seriously keep it up. you look beautiful and confident and I admire that. 

["female hair styles" is a bit cringe-worthy, as if someone who's trans is trying to emulate something they're not.]
