I really like this person, we spent time together, texted, and had a lot in common. We kissed. They said all the right things about wanting to hang out more, wanting to spend more time and then they disappeared...unanswered text messages and then radio silence. I really liked them- I opened up and just got hurt. I don't know what I did- and now I just feel sad.
