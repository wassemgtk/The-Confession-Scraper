Saw a man with 2 prosthetic legs running today in Central Park. Felt so inspired. The guy was in top shape, tall and confident, my hat is off to him. There is absolutely no excuse to not live life to the fullest and do the best with the talents you have, especially when you are healthy and smart as most of us Cornellians are.
