I have herpes. I freaked when I first found out, because all I had ever been taught about sti's is that they are terrible and horrible and that I should do everything in my power to avoid them. I was never taught in health class that an sti isn't the end of the world- that herpes is a harmless, mildly irritating skin condition that is incredibly common. It isn't a punishment for having sex, it doesn't make me dirty, or unloveable. Having herpes is a mild inconvenience for a few days out of every year. What's worse is that my friends, who are otherwise intelligent, educated, and sensitive people, don't seem to know that, or understand that herpes isn't a punchline. We don't think people with other illnesses are at fault, or somehow morally corrupt for having an infection, and yet somehow we are all so scared of sti's and the people with them. Most people will probably get one at some time in their lives, so maybe practice a little more compassion?
