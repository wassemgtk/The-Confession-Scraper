I was doing homework with my fellow grad students in Mann Library and saw this really cute girl walk by. She gave me a quick smile and ... boy, I think the whole problem set just solved itself afterwards. If I ever see you again I'll definitely try to get to know you or at least say an unavoidably cheesy line thanking you for that gorgeous smile. You made this struggling grad student feel truly happy for the first time at Cornell :)
