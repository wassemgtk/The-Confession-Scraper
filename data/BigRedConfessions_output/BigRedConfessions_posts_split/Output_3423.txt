I'm mad at my "best friend". I'm slowly coming to a realization that she only needs me whenever it's convenient for her. She doesn't really care what's going on with me, what's going on on the inside, what I'm thinking about and feeling. I hate when she is on her phone when I'm talking to her or she picks up her phone to talk to another person when I'm mid sentence. She's just inconsiderate. Not only am I mad at her. I'm very hurt. My birthday was a week ago, but I still keep thinking about how she did not try to make me feel special at all. I mean birthdays don't happen every day, and she didn't even give an ounce of an effort. She attended the birthday dinner that I organized, and that's about it. She didn't get me a present, or a card, didn't bake me a cake so I can blow the candles, didn't even make a post on Facebook. I mean she gets her boyfriend small gifts all the time for no reason...she even blew up balloons and got a present for one of our suite mates. But she did absolutely nothing for her "best friend" who apparently to her, I'm the closest person. I feel like this relationship is one sided. I hate for feeling this way but truth hurts.
