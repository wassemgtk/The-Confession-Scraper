"As a guy who is all too familiar with the whole ""nice guy"" issue - let me tell you what girls are attracted to generally - no one is attracted to jerks or assholes unless they are very shallow or themselves a jerk, especially not intelligent girls such as the ones you find on this campus.

However, they are attracted to confidence a high self esteem and to guys who can take care of themselves. A good body also helps to be perfectly honest -- I used to think that it didn't, and some girls will tell you that it doesn't because they don't want to seem shallow, but it absolutely does - guess why, because it shows you take care of yourself and it helps you project confidence. The KEY point is that you can be a perfectly nice, respectful, intelligent/nerdy, well-mannered, chivalrous, stand-up, even a sensitive guy AND have all of the above qualities as well.

And at least in my experience, girls absolutely LOVE that combination. They value both sets of qualities and if you have the whole package, you aren't going to have a problem.

The misconception exists, because ""nice guys"" all too often act overly or artificially nice because they are desperate or they are trying to compensate for something, and it almost comes across as needy. When you are so insanely respectful and gentle, it comes across as groveling and you achieve the opposite of your desired outcome."
