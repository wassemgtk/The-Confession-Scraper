My neocortex and my amygdala truly despise each other. When emotion takes over, I know exactly what's going on and how long it'll last and what the effect will be, and how pointless it is, but alas reason can't prevail and my neocortex is helpless to do anything about it. Whether it's rejection or embarrassment, or a low grade, the refractory period has to occur no matter what. Physical attraction is the same struggle. My neocortex wants to have perfectly normal intellectual conversations with attractive women the same way I have them with guys, i.e. only focusing on the words that are spoken, but no -- I have to think about how hot they are. It's honestly not a choice. It's like science vs. religion is happening in my head.
