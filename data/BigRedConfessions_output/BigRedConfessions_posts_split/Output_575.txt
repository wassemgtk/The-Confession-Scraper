"I'm the kind of guy who survives winters in Ithaca on only wearing sweatshirts (mostly out of laziness), but I don't understand all the hate against Canada goose jackets. I know they're very expensive and sure, in your opinion they might not be worth it. But why does it bother some people so much when they see others wearing an expensive jacket? In all likelihood those same people probably wear overpriced shirts, pants, bags, etc. Why not hate on them for wearing those things too? Why not hate on everyone for spending so much money on Cornell when they can go to a local college? 

Some people get so fucking jealous and judgmental here. Just do you and worry less about others. "
