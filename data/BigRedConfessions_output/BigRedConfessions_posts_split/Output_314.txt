"Dear TA's:
Please don't be snotty to students who come to you for help. You either a) are a grad TA and used to be an ""annoying"" undergrad, too, or b) you're STILL an ""annoying"" undergrad, and it may be that you're struggling with a different class that they breezed through.

Students who don't understand something and ask for help aren't dumb, or inferior to you, and despite that such an attitude is sadly pervasive throughout academia, it's a shitty attitude to have. We all got to Cornell, we all deserve to be here, and usually when we don't understand something we just need to have it explained in a different way in order to fully understand it.

To all the fabulous TA's out there, keep it up! You rock!"
