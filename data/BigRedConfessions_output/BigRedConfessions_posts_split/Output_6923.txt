Yes, I still am not over you. It's not your fault that we met at such a bad timing, but I can't help wondering why you don't want to try to at least be friends. I guess that would just end with either one of us getting hurt. I'm glad I met you though. You taught me that there are some really good guys out there and I should never settle for less. I can now only wish happiness for you.
