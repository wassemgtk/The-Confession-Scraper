Realizing I like my friend very much is kind of tearing me up inside. My friend knows I like them, and they've admitted to liking me too. But they want to just be friends, and I love our friendship. I don't not want to be friends. But knowing that our expectations and wants don't align is surprisingly painful. I want to keep being friends but god this hurts so much more than I thought was possible.
