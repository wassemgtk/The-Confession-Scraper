First PAO Bhangra now... The Hangovers... you people  are pissing quite a few folks off with the constant advertising. I'm tired of seeing smilies like I'm at a drug clinic. I just want to pull out a nice high pressurized hose and wash off all the money you wasted on the ground. My question to you people is "who really gives a fuck about your activity above all else?"
