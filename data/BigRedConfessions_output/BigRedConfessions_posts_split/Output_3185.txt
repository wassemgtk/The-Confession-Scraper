I suffer from pretty severe anxiety and depression. It's chemical, and I have slowly been able to accept that it isn't my fault I feel this way.  I'm trying my hardest every day to get through to the next until my medication kicks in...is anyone in a similar situation? I'd like to be able to find a group of people just to be around and hang out with without fear of being judged for my mental illness.
