Whenever I go to the Cornell Confessions page and I notice that the admins are putting up new entries I always rush to write in a very humorous or troll post. Many have successfully made it through  and have elicited wide-spread praise for their creativity, absurdity, and hilarity. I get a sick pleasure from knowing that I made made many people laugh with my jokes. But you want to know the sad part? This page is the only social stimulation I get apart from buying coffee in the morning. 

There have been entire weeks where I've gone without talking to anyone. My parents have shunned me, my brothers ignore me, my friends have all moved on. I have no one. The only thing that gets me through the day is composing some of these jokes for mine and your pleasure. Sometimes I just sit in an empty classroom laughing at my own jokes. HAHAHA.--But the one thing that really yanks my peni-I mean goat is that this one kid --whose name shall be withheld for screening purposes--from a Catholic high school on LONG ISLAND gets all the praise.
