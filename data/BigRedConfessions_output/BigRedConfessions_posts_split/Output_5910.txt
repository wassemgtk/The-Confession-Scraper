"One thing that has continually been pissing me off and making me incredibly sad at the same time is how women are portrayed in the media and how that affects the self-esteem of me and many other women I know. I see my roommate complaining about how her stomach isn't as flat as so-and-so's or how her arms aren't as toned and someone else. I see the looks from girls at the gym who enviously stare at other girls while silently comparing themselves to everyone else. I see girls on the bus trying to secretly compare themselves to other people, and see their faces fall when a beautiful girl gets on the bus and attracts people's stares.
It makes me so sad that women feel the need to all be stick thin and toned, but not too toned, with long, straight hair and a perfect smile with the perfect clothes and perfect shoes. Everyone is created differently and everyone has bodies that are different, why can't people accept that? Who said that you need to look a specific way to be beautiful? Society? 
Well society is fucked up.
Standing in front of the mirror pinching and pulling at different parts of your body is only going to make you feel worse, and I wish that everyone could see that they are as beautiful as everyone else.
