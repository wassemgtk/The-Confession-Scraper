Coming back from every break has made me realize how much my life sucks here. I miss my parents, my brother, and my hometown so much. The friends, food, gym, weather, are so much better at home. I can't imagine how I'm going to get through another three years of utter depression here...perhaps I should transfer to a college closer to home, but none of them offer a good education, and the one that does is still 2 hours away from my house and it's not like I have a 100% chance of getting in..
