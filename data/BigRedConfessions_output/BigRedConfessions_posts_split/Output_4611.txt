"I think I saved a girl from getting raped a couple of weeks ago.  I was sitting in my house, and there was a party going on next door.  I then heard a girl literally screaming for help. Like really screaming.  No exaggeration.

I ran outside as quick as I could, and I'm pretty sure I scared the guy away, or at least stopped him, cause as soon as I was outside, she stopped screaming and ran off. It was pretty dark outside, so I couldn't see if he stopped because he saw me running at him (and I couldn't see his face), but the guy was trying to brush it off like it was nothing.  It took everything in my power not to beat him right then and there.

I went over to the girl, who by now was with two of her friends, and being consoled and made sure she was ok. She was, but she was more worried that she had woken me or the other people in my house up. I should have stayed with her just a bit longer, just to make sure she was ok, and to let her know that she didn't wake me up. But as long as she was ok, and wasn't raped, I can sleep at night.  Who knows what would've happened if I didn't do anything and she was raped. I would not be able to sleep at night, I know that.

If that girl happens to be reading this, I'm glad you're ok and you didn't wake me up :)

And to the rest of you, keep your ears and eyes open.  You never know what could happen around you, and maybe you can save a girl from being raped."
