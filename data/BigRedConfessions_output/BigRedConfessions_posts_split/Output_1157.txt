I keep getting mood swings and have trouble concentrating on my studies up here. Example: I can only read ~5-10 pages of my genetics textbook per hour when I'm performing at top speed. Each time I catch my thoughts wandering and keep moving through these feelings of invincibility and elation to rock-bottom depression all within the course of a few hours. I just can't seem to find a happy medium where I'm calm and focused. I'm thinking of getting myself tested for bipolar or ADHD, but until then I have no idea what to do. I can't deal with this stress. If anyone's gone through this before, do you have any suggestions besides drugs?
