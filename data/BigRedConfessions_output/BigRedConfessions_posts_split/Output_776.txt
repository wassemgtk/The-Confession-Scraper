My professors at Cornell always pushed CFL and LED lightbulbs as being great because they "save the environment." I am so glad I graduated Cornell this semester. Now that I moved back home, I replaced all the lightbulbs in my house to incandescents. No government-media complex will tell me what lightbulbs I can have in my house. I will use incandescents and buy as many as I can before the government bans them because they quality of light is better with incandescents and is more natural. I don't care if my house uses more Pennsylvania coal for electricity...it's negligible in the long run anyways since our impact on the planet is not even noticeable. After all, global warming is a hoax anyways.
