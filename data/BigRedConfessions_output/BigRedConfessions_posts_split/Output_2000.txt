I graduated from Cornell, got a job at one of those hot tech firms and got the H-1B. YAY nice, right?
Not so fast... You Americans have no idea how painful it is to get a work visa. USCIS is screwing up with me. My H-1B is good only after October. I applied for a temp work visa (OPT), and USCIS rejected it. Like, they rejected because a document was supposedly 31 days old (maximum acceptable is 30 days). Detail: my application arrived on the 29th day and they actually opened it on the 31st day. 

Now I moved to an expensive city, was expecting to start working next week, but no, I can't. I tried to talk to some people about this, but my closest friends think I need their money. Well, not really for now because I still got some savings... I just wanted someone to talk vent out. Oh Lord... :(
