Am I the only one who notices that the majority of people in Engineering and Arts & Sciences are weird and socially awkward? It's like stepping into a freakin' asylum when I come on this campus. People need to amp up their social skills and stop being so depressed. I totally get depression, been there, done that. But the self-pity needs to stop people!
