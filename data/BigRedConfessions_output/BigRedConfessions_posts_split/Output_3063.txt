I'm a freshman and it has been extremely hard to adjust to Cornell. I am going through emotional, financial and social problems and I am falling behind in my work... I already failed to hand in assignments and often find myself trying to battle what is in my head & not killing myself instead of studying... I'm not sure what to do. I have tried going to CAPS but I am scared that I will get kicked out because my GPA suffered last semester too. Do they take into account mental health before they kick you out?
