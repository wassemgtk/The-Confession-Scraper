I honestly am hating life right now, when I might make a few people even jealous. I have a (what should be) awesome internship at a very top company, but I'm on day four and really don't have the confidence to be able to complete anything. Every day I dream about getting fired so that I can go home to my friends. And really the only reason I'm depressed is because, finally in my life, I realize I have spectacular friends with whom I actually do stuff, but cannot because I'm stuck hours away.
