Many would call me an attractive guy. Most girls here care so much about greek life, that it's annoying or they're very superficial. They gossip about each other like they're in high school. I can totally relate to that poster who said they felt as if they were going to a school with a bunch of overgrown children. I'm so over undergrads. I can't wait to get out into the real world and meet mature women who don't just like me for my looks; they actually have hobbies other than partying and going out. This probably comes off as close-minded, and I know there are plenty of women out there not like this. I'm just venting my frustrations. Don't even get me started on "frat bros"....this is how I felt as an undergrad here. For those of you who can relate to this, don't worry, things get better in the real world. People during undergrad are still figuring themselves out for the most part. There are a few gems out there though. Keep your head up and try to surround yourself by like-minded people, rather than being stuck by a group you hate.
