I think I'm queer. I have a fianc√© whom I love dearly, but if we weren't together, I don't know who I would be attracted to. Right now, it's him and only him... but if we weren't together, who knows? And if he had a vagina, I would still love him.

I know sexuality is a spectrum, but I'm having trouble placing where I am because my experiences are so limited.
