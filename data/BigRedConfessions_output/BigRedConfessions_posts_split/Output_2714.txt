All that's keeping me from suicide is the thought of what it would do to my mom.  My dad and siblings can go to hell, and all of two people here would even notice me going.  And back home...fucking hell, I was told some assholes were taking bets on when I'd finally snap.  Fuck those people.    
  But my mom has so little going for her.  Losing a child...that would be devastating.  But this really won't be my problem after am gone, will it?  Nothing follows you into that long silence.  Hopefully soon I'll accept that and leave.
