I think more people at this school should openly express their emotions to each other. Show your happiness, show your sadness, show your mania, show you. I honestly love to cry--from a god hit of Lauryn Hill to looking at the gorges to watching the birds. Life is so goddamn beautiful (even when it does suck), and everyone should feel open and entitled to share their feelings with one another. And this is not just for males; this is for females, too.

Shed a tear; break a smile; don't forget to tell a friend that they mean the world to you.
