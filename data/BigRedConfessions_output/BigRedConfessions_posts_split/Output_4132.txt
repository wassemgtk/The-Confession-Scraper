I've been internally battling with myself for a while now. And I need some help.  I want to be a writer. Or an editor. Except I'm a painstakingly slow reader (as in I reread sentences many times over to make sure I understand them), and I feel that my writing abilities are too elementary to become anything worth anyone's time.  My vocabulary level is in serious need of improvement, and I'm not sure I am even knowledgable enough about the English language to help others with their work. And yet, I still find myself writing short stories here and there, offering to edit friend's essays, and burying myself in other people's quirky creative blogs - wishing I could be like them. I want to learn how to be a writer!
