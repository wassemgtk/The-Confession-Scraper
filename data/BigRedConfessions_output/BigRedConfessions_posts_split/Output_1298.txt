As a member of an MGLC organization it irks me to no end when a Panhell or IFC member asks why the MGLC is needed. You hear all these stories about IFC frats not wanting black girls at their parties, and panhel sororities not wanting black sisters and it's easy to see why someone of color would not want to be in those groups. While some students do not mind being the "token" colored person, I should not be ridiculed for not wanting to be the token, and for wanting to be around people who don't judge me on my skin color. All my classes and organizations are mostly white and I only feel comfortable around MGLC members and am thankful for its creation. MGLC and other organizations for minorities were not created because we are racist or do not want to be around white people, but because white people are racist, whether implicitly or explicitly, studies show this to be true. So do not question my involvement with the MGLC when I interact with you all on a daily basis and don't question your implicit bias against those with a darker hue.
