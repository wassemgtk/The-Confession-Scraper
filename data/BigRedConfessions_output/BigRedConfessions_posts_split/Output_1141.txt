To the people who were commenting on #6866:
I just feel obligated to clarify a few things for those confused...
1.) If it is an actual service dog, the guy who posted that needs to get a grip. Allergies suck, but whatever that person is going through is worse.
2.) If this was a public place as in outside or somewhere dog friendly, that's not the owner's fault.
3.) This is the one most relevant to the discussion of emotional support animals. The laws regarding ESAs only protect the owner's right to house them in "no pets" housing and in some cases to transport them BY PLANE (and to bring it on a plane you have to go through a huge hassle telling the airline, giving them a doctor's note, etc.). If the dog is an ESA and not a service animal, it is not allowed in buildings that don't permit animals, and it would not be allowed on buses. The only animals allowed in these places that people may mistake for an ESA is a dog trained to calm people with PTSD, which is classified as a service dog.
I don't know the specifics of the case the poster dealt with, but those are the rules.
Source: I have an emotional support animal for my depression which has to bypass housing rules, so I have researched the topic extremely thoroughly.
