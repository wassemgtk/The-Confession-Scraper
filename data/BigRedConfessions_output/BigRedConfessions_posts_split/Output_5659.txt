"Dear PSB boy,

I just wanted to let you know that every stolen glance and meaningful look you gave me while I was hanging out there or other places was probably the highlight of my day that day, and that I always had the intention of saying hi but would freeze as soon as I saw you. You made me incredibly nervous for some reason. When I finally got the guts to say something, I sounded stupid/ridiculous and you seemed distracted/disinterested, so I didn't pursue anything further. But thank you for making my stressful and busy semester a little brighter! Good luck on your finals!
