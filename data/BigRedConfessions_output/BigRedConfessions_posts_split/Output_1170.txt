My engineering professor often attempts to masquerade as a political science professor and spends a preponderance of our lectures saying the most ignorant, embarrassing crap, particularly about China's political system and resource planning. I want to bash my head against the wall by the end of each class as I think to myself, "This is why people resent us. Engineers like this guy think that because they are taught to conceptualize and solve technically complex problems, they have not only the framework to understand the complexities of social and economic systems but also the license to teach students their version of history". I can't wait for this course to end.
