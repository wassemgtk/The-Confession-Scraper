I have a good friend who works at the resource center and I genuinely feel bad about how people treat her sometimes. She's too quiet and nice to say anything so guys, let's show some respect for the resource center staff. Say thank you and don't just bark at them for popcorn or point your finger. And don't get angry at them when they run out of something-they give you free food every single day, be thankful!
