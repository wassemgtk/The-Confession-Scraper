Nogwit  Mennza (not a name, don't worry Admins):

I am grateful for your name, and hope you do still watch the greatest show of all time, even without me. It's only fitting, with that beautiful, beautiful name of yours. I am glad to have known you, and always will be. I am grateful for your exquisite and surprisingly diverse taste in art. If I ever meet someone else who has seen what you have, or who shares what you and I share, I will be amazed. I am grateful for your smile and for the conversation. I am grateful for the walks. I am grateful for your hair and even for that split-second inadvertent touch of hands at lunch. Had I known what was coming, I would have gone for the hug right then. I am grateful for your kind soul and kindred spirit. I am partially glad that you don't follow this page, and yet partially sad that you won't have the opportunity to hear this. Still, I thank you for the closure. 

I agree with 5500: I should not and do not have any animosity towards you, because I am not entitled to be with you. Not to mention, I have done this infatuation thing with about a billion people, so I'm quite used to moving on and accepting the reality that I am partially to blame for all this emotion.

However, I can't help but feel some sadness. Not the mopey, complaining, self-deprecatory kind of sadness. More like the "This time truly might have been different" kind of sadness. I wish I hadn't allowed myself to get infatuated so many times before. If I had just played things safe until now, I 'd be able to distinguish my real feelings for you from my false feelings for so many others. But I'll never know. Though I suppose it doesn't matter now. 

I hope your rejection will not, as they often do, signal a sudden aversion from you towards me. I will still look forward to our walks and to hearing more about your tastes and to seeing you when I am blessed with the opportunity. I hope you will still enjoy, as you seemed to before, our time together or our conversations apart. I hope you will not in any way, shape or form change the way you approach me just because of the rejection. You have long since been forgiven, because you did nothing wrong. Please don't allow a great, budding friendship to fall apart. As Louie said (and if I haven't given myself away yet, I certainly have now), "I will wait." That is to say that I will patiently and happily soak up our friendship for as long as we both shall live, even if I no longer foresee anything becoming of it.

I do wonder something though--and if you're as real as you seem to be, you might tell me if I get the courage to ask--why not? I ask, not because I feel like I should have finally been able to succeed and want to know why I didn't. That is the mentality of those whom 5500 criticizes. I ask, only out of curiosity. I promise I wouldn't be hurt if you told me, no matter what you said.

Much love.
