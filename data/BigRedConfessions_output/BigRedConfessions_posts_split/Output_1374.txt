I...I have a huge problem. My girlfriend says she's going to break up with me because she's too small for me and she says I'm too rough. I'm really worried that every other girl I date will get scared and run away. Especially since my gf is a show and tell type of gal...all of North Campus knows by now. What if I never find a girl who's the "right size". I'm gonna be alone for the rest of my fucking life. I knew my relationship would never last.
