"I have an invisible physical disability that few people on campus know about. It leaves me in severe pain every day. One day I can be fine and the next I can't walk. 

Each day it is hard to know what tomorrow or the next day will hold for me, so I just want to remind you all to be happy for what you have.  To embrace each day with a smile no matter what you are facing. 

Enjoy the little things and live life to the fullest, because you truly don't know what incredible things your bodies do for you every day, until they don't anymore.
