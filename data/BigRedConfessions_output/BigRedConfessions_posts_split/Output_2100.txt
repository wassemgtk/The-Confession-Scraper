I really miss Cornell. I hated it when I first came. But somehow I came to love the late night Nastie's runs, bonding in the floor lounge, pulling all-nighters to finish assignments, bitching about said assignments, walking past the gorges, smiling when the clocktower played Harry Potter, and hanging out with my friends. I'm just really sad that freshman year ended so quickly. It's never going to be the same. We are going to grow apart and I'm scared of that. I'm scared that it's going to be like starting all over again (except I'm already used to the academic side). Can I just rewind back to beginning so I can appreciate my school better?
