To those that are depressed at Cornell, 
Know that there is help. Life sadly will not always be fair, easy, or even enjoyable. As a student who has suffered from depression for many years, I have only just recently started taking medications for it. Despite early reluctance to get on a medication, I don't regret it. Medication in combination with proactive therapy has been a life saver. Things still aren't perfect, nor will they ever be, but I'm learning to take control of the things in life that I used to feel helpless about. Seek help. There's no shame in going to/calling EARS, going to CAPS, or seeking help elsewhere. I now respect myself knowing that I have put in a lot of hard work to get to the more mentally stable position that I am at now. You're not alone. I hope those that profess their depression on here are willing to reach out when push comes to shove. I love you all.
