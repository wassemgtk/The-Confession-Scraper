To the guy last week who was walking from Ctown (from the law school) to West behind me at 3 am on Saturday night - thank you. Thank you for wanting to make me feel safe by keeping a huge space between us and thank you for being so sensitive about the fact that as a girl walking alone at that time is slightly terrifying. Thank you for only over taking my slow walking pace when we were in a brightly lit area on West and for taking a HUGE walk around and not briskly past me. It made all the difference to me and I wish you knew how much this meant to me, so thank you so much.
