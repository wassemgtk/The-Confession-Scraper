Dark-haired girl whom I just walked by (6 PM Tuesday) on the path leading up to the Ag quad from Tower Road, who smiled at me with her beautiful smile and continued to smile at me while we passed each other - you are insanely cute. I wish it was socially acceptable to stop and talk to people who make eye contact and smile for longer than what is considered polite. It's not just how long you smile for, it's also the type of smile. You smiled at me as if we knew each other (we do not). Have a nice life gorgeous girl!
