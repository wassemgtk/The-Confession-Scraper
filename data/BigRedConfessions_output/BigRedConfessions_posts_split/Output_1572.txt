To the boy in the red shirt and blondish hair walking down Ho Plaza Thursday around 5pm: You looked like you were about to cry. I hope things got better. I'm sorry for not stopping to ask you in person. I figured you would want your space, but I regret not asking you in person. 
Just wanted to let you know that someone cares :)
