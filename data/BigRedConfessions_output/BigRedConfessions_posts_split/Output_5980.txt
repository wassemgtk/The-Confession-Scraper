"I'm still to get a job and I'm graduating in less than a month. What surprise me is that people with very similar profiles (same classes, projects, etc) get contacted by multiple companies, while I can't even land a phone interview. This is so frustrating! I go to career services, my advisor and my friends, and they all say the same thing, that my resume looks great and that I'd be an asset to any company. 

I'm pretty sure I'm being 'racially profiled' and being left out :(
