I hate guys. While I know that not all of them suck, the ones I've been involved with suck even though they're all different. I thought the last one liked me too. Even though we were just regularly hooking up for a few months, he would show his affection through small, cute acts and that gave me faith. However, his not-giving-a-fuck-about-me became very evident when we parted ways without even a hug. He doesn't even respond to my texts. I feel so sad and so worthless that I can't even leave a lasting impression on someone I've spent so much time with this semester. I know I deserve better. I deserve to be happy. I wish I found someone who wouldn't treat me like shit for once.
