"To the girl on the late night bus. You are the most adorable girl! 

It sucks that you and your friends ran out of the bus because of that darn bumblebee. I'm sorry that you had to walk up the slope and maybe I should have intervened and vow to protect you from the bee lol. 

I hope our paths cross again! Good luck on your finals, beautiful :) And I hope this brightens up your week.
