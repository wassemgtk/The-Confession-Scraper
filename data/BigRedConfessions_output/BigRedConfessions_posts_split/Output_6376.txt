I feel depressed as fuck sometimes. I can relate a lot to the person who described his/her symptoms in confession # 1511 (the long post about depression and getting help at Gannett). The problem is, unlike other depressed people, I know why I'm depressed. Since my time at Cornell I haven't been able to make any close friends or start a relationship. Not being able to connect with anyone on a deeper personal level just makes me feel shitty at times. And the more I think about it, the more shitty I feel. This is why going to Gannett won't solve my problems.
