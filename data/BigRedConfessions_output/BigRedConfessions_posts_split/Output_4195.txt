"I have been single for 3 weeks so far and I do feel lonely. I try to think: “Man up bro, forget that bitch”. It’s hard. I look around and see that people are too busy to help. When I walk on campus, I smile to people and try to look okay. But I feel shattered from inside. 

At least I am eating healthy food and am doing exercises. And yeah music, lots of music to fill my day. Only David Gilmour can save my day.
I’ll be okay."
