"I'm a Cornell student and voting for Trump. I'm (obviously) posting this anonymously, and the fact that I feel the need to do this should be enough to understand why I'm voting for Trump. I always thought I would vote Democrat because most of my views tend to be pretty liberal and I absolutely do think Trump would make an awful president, but I think something needs to be done to put a stop to the liberal PC police, and if burning Washington to the ground by electing Trump is the only option than so be it. Liberals need to learn that people are allowed to have opinions that disagree with them, and you can't simply use shrill cries of ""bigot"" and ""racist"" to shut down any dissent. Wanting to enforce our borders or turn away refugees does not make you a racist. Opposing abortion does not make you a sexist. There are certainly valid arguments for taking in refugees and protecting abortion rights, and I'm fine with those who make them, but just shaming anyone who disagrees into silence by tying everything to racism or sexism is a more terrifying form of fascism than anything Trump brings to the table. More terrifying, of course, because it is already here.

Think about it. When Bernie Sanders visited Liberty University, an extremely conservative campus, to give a speech, they showed up and listened respectfully, without protesting or trying to silence him or violence. If Trump announced that he was coming to speak here, do you really expect that Cornell students would provide him that same respectful treatment? Remember, a key tenet of fascism is trying to silence political opponents. And yet, you accuse Trump of being the fascist."
