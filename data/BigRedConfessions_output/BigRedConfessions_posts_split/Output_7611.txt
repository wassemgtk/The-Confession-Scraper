"Friends are supposed to support other friends' endeavors, even when they know that it may not turn out. I support all of your endeavors, and I try to help you wherever I can. I'm happy for all your successes, and sad at all your losses, and patient when you need someone to listen or help you figure life out. And I see you do the same for other people on a smaller level sometimes-- I know you're not incredibly great at advice or listening, but it's nice to see you try. Somehow, when it comes to me, my thoughts/ideas/sorrows/joys just get dismissed? I'm not worth trying to help out? I'm not worth listening to?

You need more support than I do, and I'm willing to be there, but I'm tired of holding you up when you won't hold me up too.  "
