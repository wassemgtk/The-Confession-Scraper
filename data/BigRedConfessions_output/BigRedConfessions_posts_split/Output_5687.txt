"It kinda terrifies me that I applied for and accepted a job before the onset of a pretty crippling panic disorder. In fact navigating the working world and my future career in general is pretty terrifying in light of my anxiety. I really don't know how sympathetic any employers will be about me losing my shit every so often, yet I know I shouldn't play into my fear and avoid great opportunities. Feel very stuck, idk how other people deal with this :/
