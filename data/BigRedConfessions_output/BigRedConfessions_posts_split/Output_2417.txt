It's the end of Freshman year spring semester and I'm getting grades worse than what I want/ever expected. I feel like I'm becoming such a failure. My parents stopped caring that much about my grades and started caring more about my health/college experience, but I know that deep down they're still disappointed with my grades. And I am disappointed myself. My parents work hard and right now, I feel like I'm just pissing away tuition... 62k a year. I don't really know how I can live with myself if I graduate knowing that all my parents bought for me with 250k is just a sheet of paper...
