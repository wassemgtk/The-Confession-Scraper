"Here is a poem in honor of Christmas and Finals.

Trapped in the Tower

""Fa la la la
Heard up in McGraw 
The soundtrack to my nightmare
As the Chimemasters block the stair

I am the pumpkin speared on top
I'm trapped and can't be stopped
The image illustrates hell
As I've been swallowed by Cornell

I watch the hordes of nerds
walking to finals in form of herds
they've done the blacking out
and now there's no backing out

do I want to be walking to a final?
it's almost worse than a tap on the spinal
but no, i'm trapped in the tower
and my fate has exercised its power

i'm doomed to become the tower hermit
for as long as frostbite and chimes will permit
I am the nightmare of Christmas carols
as my life becomes frighteningly sterile

I get jiggity by myself
as I watch the drunkards from my shelf
I am the ghost of Christmas's past
as I grow cold far too fast

independent we stand, independent we fall
but from my perch I have seen it all
I am Cornell""

GOOD LUCK ON FINALS AND MERRY CHRISTMAS. I LOVE CORNELL"
