Throughout my life, I have come to realize I was never made to be loved. I've been betrayed by those I hold close, even my family. I am in love with my boyfriend but he doesn't love me, even though this relationship was his idea. And my friends just use me. I am entertainement for them when they need me, but they are never there for me, never understand me. That is why I am fully okay with dying doing what I love. Because my death won't matter to anyone, but the difference I made before I died will mean alot.
