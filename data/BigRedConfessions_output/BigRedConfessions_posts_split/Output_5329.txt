Freshman year is officially over. I can't believe it went so quickly and I had such an amazing year. But I'm worried because I KNOW my GPA could've been decently higher. Does having an amazing year make up for the fact that my GPA is low? How do I bounce back from this? I feel like I've screwed up because I should've started college off strong with a high GPA but I don't regret that I had fun and had a great year either... any advice on how to bounce back from this?
