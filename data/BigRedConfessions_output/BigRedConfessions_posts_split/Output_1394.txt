I really want to thank the kind student who let me use his 12:30pm room reservation for an interview today. I was a derp and reserved the room from 12:30am to 2am, and you had reserved it from 12:30pm to 2pm, but you gave it up without any fuss, even though you also needed it badly.

The interview went quite well - thanks again so much.
