My best friend across the world is so good at solving my problems. She understands what's going wrong with my life from my stories alone and solves it for me before I even realize there was a problem. I am so grateful for her support but I feel terrible because I don't know how to fix her issues. I am sorry, F. I wish you were in the country when I left. I miss you terribly.
