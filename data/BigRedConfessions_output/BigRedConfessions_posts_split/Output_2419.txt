I would've given you a second chance after you screwed everything up, but you never texted me again. And then I saw you twice in two days and you didn't acknowledge me, even though I saw you looking at me. I had a really good time with you but apparently you only wanted me for sex. 

I want to believe myself when I say I'm over it but it hurts me that I believed every nice thing you said to me when apparently none of it was true.
