"I bought a valentine's day gift for someone and I was planning on delivering it to her this evening. I had known her since last semester and I wanted to just be nice, that was all. She was nice to me and we texted each other a few times, even hung out once at dinner. I considered her a friend. So as I go into lecture today, I overhear her  (she didn't think I was able to hear her) asking her friend to block the row so I couldn't sit near her.

In that instance, any confidence I had built up was blown away. I hadn't known that I made her feel uncomfortable, maybe even creeped her out (She most likely does think I am creepy and annoying). Sadly, this isn't the first time something like this has happened. In high school, my luck with women, even just as being friends, was very poor. There was even a time where someone screamed at me during class because I was staring at her. 

What is wrong with me? I thought college was supposed to be different, but I was apparently wrong. Any connections with people that I may have begun to build last semester are fading away. I sometimes say the wrong things at the wrong time. I'm not very good at taking subtle hints. I sometimes make things awkward. There will always be a guy that will have better looks, better talent, better intelligence, who is taller, who has a better sense of humor, who has a better personality than me. It is just impossible for me to compete. The worst part of it is that its not just for relationships (I gave up on those a long time ago), but for friendships. I even sometimes annoy my roommates. 

So yeah, happy valentine's day to me..."
