Being a Joisey Cornellian I can tell you that NJ has the best pizza, best highways in the nation, best utilities and infrastructure, and the best public transit. We also have the cheapest fuel, because NJ does not have a sales tax on gas. I love my job at an oil refinery as a result, because scientists make the most working in this industry and NJ has one of the biggest refineries in the country. We are really the crossroads of the world. It's no wonder why everyone wants to live there and commute to NYC, and house prices reflect that. We are between two great cites Philly and NYC too and in the tri-state area which has a lot of great things to do. California on the other hand is pretty boring I would have to agree I lived there for a few years when my dad was relocated for a project with his company and it sucked. Our business climate is also better with lower taxes and regulations than California's crazy nanny-state policies, like that of reminding people that lead or gasoline is a chemical known to the State of California to cause cancer. The public transportation was lacking compared to the speed and schedules we have over here. In NJ/NYC we have a fast-paced lifestyle which is great because it helps me work to my potential over a slow, boring, relaxed California lifestyle. Boston and DC aren't too far away either and you can take the high speed Acela trains which zoom past the Northeast Corridor catenary and track system on electricity produced by our beautiful Pennsylvania Jersey Maryland electric grid anywhere from 125-150 mph, soon reaching speeds up to 160mph with the catenary upgrades, leaving Caltrain, Metrolink, or any of the California state-subsidized Amtrak services in the dust.
