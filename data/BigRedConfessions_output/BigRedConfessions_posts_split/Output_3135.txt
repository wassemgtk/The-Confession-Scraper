I feel like everything that isn't academic related at this school involves significant amounts of social climbing. Like if you don't want to be a social outsider, then you pretty much need to rush a Greek organization. The clubs are bad too-- most of them either don't do anything, or do, but require social climbing. The Daily Sun is a good example. 

What's worse, I've realized, is that this is probably reflective of the real world.
