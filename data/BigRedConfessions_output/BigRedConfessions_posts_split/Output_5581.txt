I'm finding it hard to get into more serious relationships with girls. We will meet and everything will be going good for a little while and then I'll just stop talking to them. I don't even know why, but I do. Anyways, I feel I acted so disinterested that they eventually lose interest. However i have also noticed that if I act interested from the get go, then they don't want to be with me. It's so hard to find the right balance :/
