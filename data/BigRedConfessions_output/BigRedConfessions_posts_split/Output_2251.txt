Although I feel like I should support the multiple social causes being protested around campus, I've been turned away by the complete incompetence of the students protesting. Their intentions are respectable, but their methods are honestly just embarrassing. Taking your social causes to Skorton's retirement party? Shame on you, and have some decency. I'll make my own personal effort to be socially responsible, but the social activism groups on campus that I would have liked to join have alienated their peers by acting just as entitled and immature as those they hope to educate.
