If you think I'm going to apologize for something I didn't do, you're wrong. I am not taking shit from anyone, including you. You were completely irrational in how you reacted to my concern for you and were very hurtful. If our long-term friendship is lost over something as trivial as this, it wasn't a real friendship and I willingly accept that. I thought this was real, but if you're going to be immature and stop talking to me altogether, then have fun with that. You'll soon understand how important I was to you and you'll miss it.
