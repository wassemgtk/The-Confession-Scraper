Just saw my way failing (with the curve) grade for the final for one of my classes.
I know I'm going to end up failing that Orgo final in less than 48 hrs, especially given I have another test to study for that's tomorrow.
I see all of these mother's day posts about needing to make momma proud, meanwhile I know that after having a pretty good semester, in these last few weeks I have completely crashed and burned and will now disappoint her, possibly more than any semester yet. 
Yay for being terrible at everything!
