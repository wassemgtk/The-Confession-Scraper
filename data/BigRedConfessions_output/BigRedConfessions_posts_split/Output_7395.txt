My friend and I talk about attractive guys and sex a lot but it doesn't mean that I don't want to date her. I'm afraid to outright tell her and I'm afraid that all the talking about guys we do isn't helping my case. I'm pansexual and I've never made my sexuality a big deal but I feel like I should  I have told her before we got so close. We are really flirty and I can't help but feel a connection with her but I guess I'll just keep it all to myself
