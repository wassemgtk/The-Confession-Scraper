Coming from a third world country, I am aware of the difficulties and challenges that minority students face here at Cornell. And as a TA, I've tried to be exceptionally considerate of their circumstances and I have been incredibly patient with them. After all, I want to make them realize that I care about their situations too. But what I find appalling is when these students end up being demanding and don't even know how to say thank you. They don't recognize that you have made an effort to care. I am not saying that they don't have a right to be demanding because they're minority students. For me, I just want them to treat me with the least amount of appreciation just as how I have been thoughtful of their struggles.
