The NRA event held by the Cornell Republicans on Monday was awesome! I acquired a free extension to my 5-year strong NRA membership and some cool gear! The free pizza was amazing too. If only the people in my field knew I was an NRA member. I'm sure they would have ostracized me from group projects and other social gatherings. Most likely my grades would also suffer if the profs knew since they are quite liberal in my field. I cannot wait to graduate next month and work finally to be able to get a lifetime NRA membership, since I love firearms.
