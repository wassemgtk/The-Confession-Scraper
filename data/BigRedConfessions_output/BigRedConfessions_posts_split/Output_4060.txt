"It's really hard being the shy, awkward, and reserved person in your group. My roommates friends are so easy to love and talk to, but it takes awhile for me to be comfortable enough with someone to actually talk to them. And most people don't really take that kind of time anymore; they dismiss me as boring or something. 
I'm not boring; I just need time to be able to open up. As much as I wish I could be more extroverted, I'll have to satisfy myself with the knowledge that I am a good person and a great friend to those people who take the time for me."
