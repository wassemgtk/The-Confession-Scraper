"I wish that physics would allow me
to exceed the speed of light.
I would go back in time and find me
and make sure that the night
when you had to walk alone
in a frigid, blinding snowstorm 
would be never to be known
to occur, as to atone
for expecting that the sweetest,
cutest, funnest, brightest girl
should be stuck to wait until its
1+ seconds after four-rel
is without a doubt ridiculous.
To be anything but punctual
or an inch short of meticulous
isn't bound by relativity
when your smile is a function
with a lim of plus infinity.
I'm so sorry I was late,
I'm asking you for an advance.
Let me take you on a date.
Please give me another chance!"
