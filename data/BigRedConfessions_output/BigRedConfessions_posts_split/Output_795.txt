After crunching the numbers, it seems like my graduating cumulative GPA will be a 3.25 in the most ideal scenario (which will almost certainly not happen). Can I even get into any medical school at this point? What else is there to do with a bio degree? This is pretty distressing.

The emotional pressure of being labeled a failure by my parents really doesn't help, either.
