I find it really weird and hypocritical when people insult others who choose to have video game/anime/cartoon characters as their profile picture, and then they themselves have a picture that has like 20 people, or they're in the far background, and you can't tell who is even in the picture. And then they complain that the fictional character pictures are stupid, and a way to hide? "Real" picture or not, if I were to just look at either kind of picture, I would probably have no idea whose profile it belonged to. Stop sounding so condescending.
