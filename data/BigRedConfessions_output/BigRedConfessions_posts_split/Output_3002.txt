I used to love this school. Even when things started to get hard and my GPA took a bit of a dip sophomore year, I still argued that I loved the place because I really felt a sense of community with the people here. Now I'm in my junior year and I just can't bring myself to even think "I love Cornell" anymore. I just feel so beaten and battered, and, as much as I love my friends, part of me wants to quit and give up. I just don't know what I want to do with my life, so it feels like all of this insane hard work I do in the engineering school is pointless. It feels like Cornell has just completely drained me.
