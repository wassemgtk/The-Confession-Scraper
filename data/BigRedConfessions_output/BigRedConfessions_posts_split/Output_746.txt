My GPA is on a steady decline. It's a 2.8 at this point. My parents are trying to help me figure out why I'm so bad at school but I have no idea. I can't focus on school work. I can't study for more than a couple hours a day. I want to get an internship, but every cut off is at a 3.0. I feel like such a failure. And my mom just told me that maybe I'm just not smart enough to be an engineer. I don't know what to do at this point. I suffered from depression last semester, but my parents don't even believe that its  a real illness and just laugh when I say that might be my problem. Maybe I should just drop out. I don't know how to get back on track.
