Several Cornell employees harbor resentment towards us students and I just don't understand it. They think of us all as spoiled trust fund babies who've never known a day of hardship and don't value hardwork. While that maybe true of some students at Cornell, the vast majority of us worked hard for years and earned a place at this university. There are kids whose presence here would be impossible without scholarships that they also worked hard for. My parents can comfortably afford an Ivy League education, but that doesn't mean my life hasn't been difficult too. I struggled through years of abuse and depression, but somehow I got here. I heard a Cornell employee mocking another student, asking him how it felt to waste $30,000 in six months. Well, I wouldn't know. I don't really consider an investment in my future a waste.
