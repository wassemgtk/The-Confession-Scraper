Although I know I'm not emotionally attracted to girls and frankly wouldn't want to be anyway... Lately I've been wanting to experiment physically with other girls.. I don't know if I've hit a point of sexual frustration where I am willing to try with girls since I haven't hooked up with any guys lately or if this means I am bicurious? Not sure how to feel about all of this.
