Watching the "This Is" video now, after three semesters here, I can say that I truly understand and feel it on a whole new level. If you haven't seen it yet, you really should. I have never seen anything that really captures Cornell so perfectly, and I think that you can understand it on a whole new level each time you watch it. Our school is incredible, and I'm going to miss it so much over break.
