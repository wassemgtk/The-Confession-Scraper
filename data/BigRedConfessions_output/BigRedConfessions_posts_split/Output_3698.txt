I confessed my feelings to my crush from last semester in the beginning of this year. They weren't reciprocated but we started talking and texting and eventually became really good friends. Now, it's just weird if we don't exchange at least one text every day. Would've loved this to have gone further but I am genuinely glad of my new friend.
