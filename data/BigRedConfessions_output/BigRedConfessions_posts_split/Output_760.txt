There was a post below about receiving your exams after taking them and there was a comment about why test taking and getting your test back are not mutually exclusive. I just wanted to say that I still think thats bullshit. When I take a test and I see something I don't kniw I want to learn how to do it. I took a semester long class to learn this shit and if I'm not being told how to do it afterwords I feel two things: one is that it makes me feel like nobody cares about my learning -- I want to be able to leave a class saying I knew how to do most of whats on the final. It also makes me feel like comparing the schools is more important than individual education, and if thats the case then please let me pack my stuff and go to another school. Instead of focusing on whether you're teaching the same thing or about standards an whatnot, I think much would come out of the administration making sure the students are actually learning. This semester I was only asked whether certain professors deserved teaching awards and not asked what they could do to improve. Not only does that put a positive bias on professors but it doesn't allow students to voice the very present dissatisfaction with certain professors.
