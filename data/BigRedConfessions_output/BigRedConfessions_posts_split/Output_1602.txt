I am bicurious. I think I might be bisexual, but I can't be sure because I have never really had enough experience to tell either way. I would actually like to meet people and discuss this stuff and probably even try dating a person of the same gender to know for sure, but I am scared that the other person might get offended that I was using them to figure myself out ( which is extremely fair on their part). This is where I feel like I reek of straight, cis privilege but I am not a person who blinds themselves to the struggles of marginalized communities. I just wish I could figure myself out.
