Hey there, this is OP from #5520. You know what? After receiving such negative comments from strangers who suggested ending my relationship with my bf because he hasn't visited me...I've realized that these things don't matter. He actually loves me and I'll be damned if even such an obstacle on a bad day would stop us! What do you all know? It could all be circumstantial. Stop generalizing and making mountains out of molehills! And to everyone who's always thinking about everyone else's two cents on your relationship--they don't actually know it--you do! So let's have some faith in our own judgment. 

Peace, love, and hope.
