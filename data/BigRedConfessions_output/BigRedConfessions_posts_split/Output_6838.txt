Last night, I had a dream. I was visiting my high school and went to my hot teacher for some help. Somehow, she took me to a room with a bed and pushed me on it and started taking her clothes off. She came over to kiss me, but I pushed her away. I felt guilty because I thought I was cheating on my current girlfriend in Cornell. For some reason, I feel like if my girlfriend was in my place, she wouldn't do the same.
