"Things I'll never say:
I want to be your girlfriend. 
I want to go out to dinner with you, or go see some ridiculous movie and sit in the back and make fun of it. I want to walk around late at night and talk to you. I want to break into a building and get on the roof and admire all of Ithaca way down below us with you and a bottle of wine. I want to know all your dreams and aspirations. I want to hear about all the places you've been, everything you've done. I want to go new places with you, and try new things. 
I want to fight with you and cry because you're probably right, in the long run. I want to be apologetic, and for you to forgive me, even if it takes a little time. I want to kiss you, and have sex with you, and wake up in sheets that smell like you. 
I want to spend time without you, with my friends, but still know that they aren't as lucky as I am to have a guy like you.
I want you to know all of this because I can't tell you myself. I just want to be your girlfriend."
