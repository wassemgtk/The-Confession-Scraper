"The people expressing outrage at Julius's column here (http://cornellsun.com/blog/2014/04/18/letter-to-the-editor-the-danger-of-rape-culture-denial/) are extraordinarily misguided. Perhaps the only thing they got right was that 1 in 4 is a better guess than 1 in 40. But most data puts it closer to 1 in 8.

I know multiple people who are on the judicial board. I hear them complain constantly about other members of the board not taking cases seriously. I was speaking to a close friend who's been on dozens of sexual assault cases. The vast vast majority of rape cases result in suspensions or explusions (contrary to the claims of the article).

But that doesn't make me furious at all. What makes me furious is that my friend knows multiple people who were falsely convicted by the panel. He voted no; others voted yes. He paid attention; other texted, ignored facts, and went on long rants about how bad rape was without actually examining the question ""did this specific person commit rape?"" He speaks particularly hatefully of one girl who he's been on several sexual assault cases with. On two of those cases, the accused was acquitted 4-1, because neither he nor the other student nor the staff member nor the faculty member on the board thought he did it. But this girl has never voted to aquit somebody of a sexual assault charge. Facts don't matter.

The process is more fucked than that. The JA is the attorney for both the accused and the victim. She's responsible for defending the accused if the accused is innocent and prosecuting the accused if the accused is guilty. Who gets to decide which role she should be playing? She does, of course. Sound fair? Not to me.

The process is more fucked than that. The students on the judicial board are essentially chosen by the JA.

How do I know? I was falsely accused of rape. I took a settlement and was suspended from Cornell for two years because I was scared to death. I was scared of crazy people on the panel who have never voted to aquit a single student. I was scared of a system where I can't face my accuser. I was scared of a JA who told me her job was to help me and then told me two weeks later that she wasn't going to help me and her job was to hurt me. I'm scared of a standard of proof that says ""if its more likely than not that you did this, we'll expell you.""

The Cornell judicial process is INSANELY broken. But what scares me most is the attitude of my fellow students. ""Due process"" is supposed to ensure that the outcomes are fair - it's not some loophole that rapists jump through. Watch carefully while you throw it out the window and hope that you're never on the receiving end of a false accusation."
