I really thought that this year would be fun, it's my senior year after all. The people who I thought were supposed to be my closest friends aren't and I can rarely see the people who actually still are my friends. I really hate my "friends" but at the same time I can't help but care about them because I still consider myself to be their closest friend even if they don't treat me that way anymore. Did I do something wrong? I don't think I did, so why don't they actually talk to me? They just used me and when they were done they tossed me aside. Now they just keep me around whenever it's convenient for them but I would still do so much, give so much to make sure they're happy. Haha, I guess it's my fault in the end. I really fucking hate my friends.
