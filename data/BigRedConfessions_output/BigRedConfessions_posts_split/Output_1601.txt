I told you I wouldn't hate you. Well, I guess that turned out to be a lie. Oddly enough, I'm ok with it, as you lied to me for months. I really should thank you, as you taught me the truth; trusting is for fools, and I need to look out for myself instead of putting all my energy into trying to help others. I was a fool, but no longer.
