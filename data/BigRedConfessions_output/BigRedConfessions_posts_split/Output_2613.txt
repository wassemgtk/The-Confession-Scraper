Incoming freshman: I don't want to take the swim test. I don't want a crappy randomly assigned roommate. I want to party but I'm scared of being caught underaged drinking(it was easy to get away with in high school). I want to make friends but I don't know if I will. 
I'm visiting campus for the first time alone and I'm nervous for that too.
