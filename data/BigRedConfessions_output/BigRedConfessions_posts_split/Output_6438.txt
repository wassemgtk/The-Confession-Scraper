I'm a submissive and I'm dating a guy with a dominant personality. I should be happy, but recently I've been starting to think that he's a dominant in a different way than I'm a submissive, and he makes me feel really bad about myself very often (borderline emotionally abusive). I kind of want to meet someone else but I feel like it's very difficult to meet well-rounded dominants here, and it repulses me to think about submitting to someone who isn't at the very least my equal in social, academic, and professional success. When I tried being single in the past I'd just end up dating someone I didn't really like. What do I do?
