I am glad someone spoke up about corporal punishment and mentioned the benefits of using it at Cornell. I got hit by my parents for making mistakes and I grew up to be a respectful, non-weak individual who didn't complain because I had a real father, not a weak one who would divorce my mom and leave to find another women. I am glad to have had such strict parents because I am now making six figures running my own business after just graduating 3 years ago. I think the discipline instilled within me was the best thing that could have happened. I hope to keep the same discipline in my household when I have kids and I hope that liberals don't outlaw my way of raising my own kids the right way.
