As graduation rolls in this Sunday, I'm searching through all my pictures over the last 4 years to make a short slideshow to commemorate all the great times with my friends. But I noticed that I don't have many pictures with friends, maybe a few dozen at most. I scroll through my roommate's pictures over the past four years: hundreds of pictures of him surrounded with friends, smiles to goofy faces, wearing anything from formal attire to crazy costumes. I sit back, speechless, hit with the sudden realization that I had hardly any of that. Perhaps I've been fooling myself that I have these close friends with crazy adventures all these years, perhaps I've walled up myself and prevented these connections from forming, perhaps the reason why I don't have these great times is because I simply didn't try. With that said, I sit here and wonder why? Why didn't I try harder to make connections with these people? Why did I put these walls up in my life? Why didn't I have a crazy spring break with my friends? Why do I care so much? In the end, I realized if I put up this slideshow, I'd just expose the lie, my delusion, of my bountiful and fulfilling social life, when in actuality I'm still struggling with finding my social circle, finding my true friends, and learning to be a true friend.
