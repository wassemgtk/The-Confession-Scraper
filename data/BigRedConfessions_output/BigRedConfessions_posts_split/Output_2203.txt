I think the best compliment someone can give me is telling me that I'm kind. I don't know why, but it makes me happy that people see me as kind, and as someone who they can trust. As someone that doesn't have ulterior motives. I'm glad people can see me as that person, and I'm glad I can be that person to someone when they need it.
