"I still dont understand why classes like finance and intro to econ (whether micro or macro) are not mandatory or at least highly suggested. Considering how arts has many reqs, i dont know why these two classes are not part of them.

Seriously these classes are so useful in life, more than other ""reqs"" that we are forced to take or eventually we will be forced to take knowing the university administration. Finance would rank high in usefulness with swimming, language req and even the math one; and it would help to educate some people who think economics and money magically work in this country"
