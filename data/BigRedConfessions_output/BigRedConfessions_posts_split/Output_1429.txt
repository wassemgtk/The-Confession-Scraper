The beauty about the United States is that we still have a first amendment, so going back to all these conservative posts, and whether its one person or multiple people writing them, I really respect your thoughts and ideas, even though I am a liberal myself! Keep on posting and exercising your constitutional rights! If it were not for the Constitution we might be under a dictatorship like in North Korea or a communist country like China or Cuba, and you would not be here posting these things. Even Great Britain bans free speech and banned some American talk show hosts from entering the country simply because they had strong viewpoints.
