"A pretty significant part of me wants to quit my major and start college over to become a psychologist. I've actually known I wanted to be a counselor since high school, but I was so depressed myself that I didn't think I'd be good for the job. But now I realize that having depression and anxiety, struggling with a dermatillomania, probably having a personality disorder (it's not officially diagnosed yet), surviving child abuse, and being pansexual and genderqueer... would make me a better counselor, not a worse one, because I actually GET it. I don't just know about these issues, I really UNDERSTAND them, because I've been there too, I've lived it, I know what it's like. There's only so much you can empathize with a person without having lived their life.

But I'm a rising senior and my brother starts college right after I graduate, and my parents definitely can't afford to pay for two college students at once. I don't know if I'll ever get to follow this path.
