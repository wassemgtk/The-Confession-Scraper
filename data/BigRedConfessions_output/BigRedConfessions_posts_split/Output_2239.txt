My boyfriend just messaged me apologizing for something he almost did, and thought by telling me and apologizing, it would make the situation better. Truth is, I would have found out about it eventually, and this is one more thing on a long list of his mistakes. I just talked to him about some things that he has been doing, and obviosly he didn't care. I think we're done. Sad thing is, we just had a great night at the movies.
