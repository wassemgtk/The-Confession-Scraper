In response to confession #5310 and other concerning posts I've read, I wanted to share something. I am a former EARS counselor and now I'm in the best mental health counseling program in the country. I think a lot of people would say EARS is not as good compared to CAPS/SHS, however, I can honestly say that I've learned so much more from my time through EARS compared to my current program. My current program is intense and as I said, the BEST in the country, but becoming an EARS counselor was way more arduous. We have to go through at minimum, 3 semesters of training and tons and tons of simulation tests before being decided upon our readiness by a panel. I would say, most of those counselors are better than me right now since I've forgotten some of the EARS skills I've learned. Walk-ins and calls are completely anonymous and if you are ever afraid of revealing your identity, then just give them a call [255-EARS (255-3277)]. As a former EARS counselor, we honestly have no way of tracking or knowing who you are. Tell us your story, and we will lend you our EARS.
