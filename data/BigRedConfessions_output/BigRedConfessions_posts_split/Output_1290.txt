For the people on here to who post about depression, anxiety and etc. I just want to say that it is important for you to seek help. Seek help now before you convince yourself that you can magically "fix" yourself without actually changing anything in your life. There is no shame in therapy, and it can be beneficial to anyone, even if you feel that you don't have anything "wrong" with you.

That being said... if you are considering CAPS... you should consider it more as a first step rather than a long-lasting therapy solution.

Quite frankly, CAPs is overbooked and filled with overworked counselors (and some of whom are just plain bad and don't care) who see you as part of an overstressed tide of Cornell students. It will take you a while to get an appointment, especially if you are unlucky. Once you do meet your counselor, don't be surprised if the session is extremely impersonal and even unhelpful. I can't provide any concrete proof of this, but I have heard stories from friends of students who went to seek 'help', confessed suicidal feelings, and were forced to withdraw from Cornell for a semester.

My personal experience was not great. My counselor kept making generalizations about me based on my status as a Cornell student and my race (apparently, all of my problems stemmed from my race, "culture" and parents... and not me as an individual). They never asked any in-depth questions or seemed to care about getting anything but a surface understanding of my problems. I can't really blame them though, because I was probably the 1000th student they'd seen. 

The best thing you can get from Gannett CAPS is a referral to a therapist, psychologist or psychiatrist in the Ithaca area.
