I am a girl. I have a 28-inch waist, 36-inch bust, a classically 'feminine' face shape, large eyes, the works, and often get compliments for my appearance. The only significant period of time I've ever gone without sex has been entirely decided upon by myself and easily dealt with through masturbation (side note: my sister was shocked when I mentioned this to her because she didn't know girls can touch themselves - ladies, please please explore!); otherwise, I have had no trouble finding a willing partner. I have a loving boyfriend (for anybody looking to judge, he has been my only sexual partner since the start of our relationship, but if that were not the case that would be a matter entirely between him and me) and a tight-knit group of friends, and I adore the people that have surrounded me throughout my college career.

That being said, as I begin to read through Elliot Rodger's manifesto and watch his Youtube videos, I empathize with him more than most seem to. Despite being an attractive female, I understand the trauma he has faced with social anxiety preventing him from bonding to people. In fact, until I met my boyfriend, I could never imagine truly opening up to anybody about the pain and abuse I've experienced (unfortunately I seem to always have attracted a bit more sexual attention than I wanted, including from a then-trusted acquaintance who took the opportunity to provide me with an extremely unwanted and painful sexual debut at a far younger age than appropriate), and he has done an unbelievable job of teaching me to trust and love, as well as acknowledge my negative emotions and show me how to deal with them positively. While I have chosen to keep that experience from my friends here because I hope it is hardly relevant to them, my boyfriend's patience and love has helped me forge true connections with them. I know that had I not met him, my mental state would likely never have retreated from the suicidal tendencies I hardly ever face now.

I was very lucky to have met such an incredible partner. I believe that hardly anybody finds somebody so perfect for themselves, and especially not at such a young age. It is even harder for a person terrified of saying the wrong thing or worse, not saying the right thing and then freezing from the terror of isolation and exhaustion from constant failed efforts. I have experienced Elliot's impossible desire to be in the popular, preppy crowd and knowing I'd never fit in, shallow as it now seems to my current self who can't decide between buzzing her head or dyeing it a rainbow. I know I only have that self-confidence because somehow, impossibly, I've found social validation. What's more, I've become cocky enough to know that if I somehow lose my current group of friends, I'll find a new one.

Elliot was not so lucky, and I shudder to think that, had our social fates been switched, he would have calmly graduated this spring while I sunk deeper and deeper into my old melancholy. I found help, but how could you judge somebody for not being lucky enough to find a healthy way to end their suffering? Nobody looks out at the world and says, "You know, I want to be remembered as a murderer and a socially awkward loser." Look through his Youtube channel - he tried to find happiness in appreciating the beauty of nature, he tried constantly to find love, but he couldn't satisfy himself with the former and couldn't succeed in the later. That's enough to drive anybody mad. He does not deserve the hatred now poured thickly upon him. How can you not pity him? He never got to mature into the confident young man he so desperately tried to portray. 

There are many posts on here from people who are lonely at Cornell. Often, people comment asking the OP to lunch, or a walk, or anything. Please, please, please if you feel alone here, know that there are always others in the community looking out for you. I love you, no matter what your life story. I don't care if you're a rapist or a rape victim, on probation or the Dean's List, in the 1% or the 99%, you all need love and acceptance and please realize that if you felt as if you had no support system, you too would grow desperate. Please realize that you always have a support system within Cornell's community. Go to EARS, or CAPS, or write an anonymous confession to find a friend, or invite an interesting acquaintance to dinner, or join a club, or comment on here. Please remember you are loved, and you are interesting and important and wanted.

Have an amazing summer, Cornell, and please try not to judge. I apologize for this post's lack of cohesiveness.
