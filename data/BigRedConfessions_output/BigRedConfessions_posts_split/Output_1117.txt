Join band. it's amazing that I, a socially avoidant freshman, have found such a loving network of friends and acquaintances within a mere two months. It's become, more or less, a kind of family to me; I'm on my own for a lot of things (as I like to be), but every day or so, I can see a familiar face somewhere, smile and wave, strike up a cheerful conversation, and brighten my day, whatever it's been like before. Honestly, I'm so surprised that such an openly friendly organization exists anywhere on this campus. Frankly, following those silly "JOIN BAND" signs during O-Week was the best decision I've made here.
