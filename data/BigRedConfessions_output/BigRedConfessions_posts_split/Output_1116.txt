I'm so totally sick of dating a guy only to find out on the 5th or so date that he doesn't want to ever consider being in a relationship with only one person. C'mon, dudes, if you just wanna Netflix and Chill then freaking say so, there are plenty of girls into that and they'll do so with out a date. Don't wine and dine the ones who obviously aren't in to that, you're not being a gentlemen, just a manipulative dick.
