I watched the Hindi movie 3 Idiots a long time ago, and it's a pretty good movie about friends who meet by struggling together at a top engineering college in India. Anyways, I'm not usually emotional when watching movies, and I wasn't the first time I watched this one. But I started watching it again today, and suddenly all the shit that the characters experience at college resonated with me so much; in the beginning, a student commits suicide because he can't complete a project in order to be able to graduate on time, and while I'm not suicidal, I often feel like I'm up against a wall. It's like I'm constantly putting my 110% into running a race I know I'll never win, and the pressure to try harder and take on more responsibility and still be happy is way too much. And there's nothing I can do to take the pressure away. 

So yeah. I didn't think fiction would make me cry, but I guess because of where I am in life right now, this movie fucking destroyed me.
