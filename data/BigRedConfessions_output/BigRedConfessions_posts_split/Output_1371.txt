I’m getting kind of sick of the frequency of these research/internship applications where minorities and under-represented groups are encouraged to apply. Don’t get me wrong, I think it’s great that they exist, and it marks a huge turning point in our country. But it seems like literally every paid position (in biology at least) that I’ve come across is geared towards minorities. And for a white male, that basically seems to equivocate to “don’t bother applying”.  I have no problem accepting the privileges I have as a white male, but it seems impossible to get anywhere with my career. Since freshman year I’ve applied to every program I could, but I always end up working through the spring to be able to afford a lousy unpaid summer internship that isn’t taking me anywhere. It was extra frustrating in the case where I knew the person who won over me was completely unqualified. It seems like the only way I’ll ever be able to work abroad is to buy my own plane ticket, and pay for my stay while I volunteer, and there’s no way I can afford that. I get good grades, I do great in interviews , and I have an insane resume. 

I hate that I’m complaining about this, but I’m honestly starting to feel like the field in general just doesn’t want me.
