I totally understand why people that work in the dining halls only work there for a semester or less before they quit. The management fucking sucks. The workers are phenomenal, but our bosses SUCK. So close to quitting, I'm just glad that vacation is here so I can re-evaluate. I love my job but how is it that these people assume things without even ever saying hi to you. Ugh my rant. Haha the funny thing is that this confession literally fits into hundreds of kid that work at cornell. Honestly, get to know your workers and learn how to professionally assess an unprofessional situation!!!
