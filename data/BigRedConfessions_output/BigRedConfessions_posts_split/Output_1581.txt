Is it a problem that I have the opportunity to use the race card to get everything I want in life that the liberals gave me? Yes! I'm a conservative black myself, and it feels humiliating having priority for a lot of things in life because you are black and "disadvantaged" in the eyes of liberals. Sometimes I feel as though I am inadequate because of my skin color that I have to gain some privilege above Caucasians. I just wish everyone were equal in society and we could forget about slavery and all that crap and live in harmony like we were before 2008 before people started turning against each other and the Black Lives Matter Movement came into effect. As a black person myself, I have to say I despise the movement along with the cops lives matter movement and would rather have #AllLivesMater instead of singling races out which is brewing more racial hatred.
