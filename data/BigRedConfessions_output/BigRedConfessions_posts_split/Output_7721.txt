"I'm socially incapable. It's really sad to not be able to make any friends. And to be unable to accept anybody trying to help. I'm sick of eating dinner alone. I'm sick of having nobody to talk to. Spending countless hours alone in my room crying while everybody else goes out the weekends.

Please don't help me. Please help me."
