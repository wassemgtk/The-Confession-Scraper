I hate people who are so fucking environmentally conscious that they have to criticize every fucking life decision you make. Get over it you conceited fuck. You're only fooling yourself if you think you're actually saving the planet. It takes a considerable amount of arrogance to sincerely believe that the planet needs saving. Most environmentalists are arrogant pricks who seriously need to get their heads out of their asses.
