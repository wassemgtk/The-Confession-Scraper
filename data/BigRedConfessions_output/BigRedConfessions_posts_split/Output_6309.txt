"I made such a huge mistake, and the more and more I think about it, the more depressed I become.  I end up crying often now thinking about how I left you because we were too difficult for me to do, so I chose something easier.  And easier is still good and fun, but it's turning bitter in my mouth as I realize how easy is cheap and isn't going to last, where as you and I could have made it.  We would have gotten married in a few years, had a calm and sweet life and maybe even a kid or two.  Now that I've had almost a year to think about it, I realize the mistake I've made, and now it's too late.  I can never tell you this, because I'm sure you'll end up with the girl you're with now.  I know you're happy, and I don't want to ruin that or make it any harder for you.  I don't want to hurt the guy I'm with now.  I just wish I didn't have to feel like this all the time.  I guess I'll just have to live with this regret.

A lesson to anyone who took the time to read this:  Don't take the easy way out if the difficult way still holds any glimmer of promise.  Working hard for something that has a definite outcome is better than putting in no work for something that will probably come out to nothing."
