I joined a club my freshman year because I loved the people in it at the time, but now the only people left are a bunch of whiny, bitchy juniors who only pretend to do what they're supposed to and make my life as a prominent member of the club an actual living hell. Thanks for turning something I loved into something I despise. Good luck keeping the club going when I'm gone. You'll need it.
