There's a person I stopped talking to 3 years ago, around the time I started college.
I got scared and thought he didn't want to talk to me anymore first, but I remember seeing him back at our high school during the first year. Could have sworn he was looking at me from across the room, in a way that might have been wondering why I didn't go up to him, but it was pretty far away, so I could be mistaken.
I kinda want to try to contact him again, but I'm scared.
