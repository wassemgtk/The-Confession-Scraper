"It seems like for me, guys who like me tend to fall into two categories:
1. Guys who just like my body
2. Guys who just want to be friends
with absolutely no overlap between the two categories. This of course leads to the fact that I've only had one real boyfriend and even he fell into category 1. It's getting beyond frustrating, to the point where I'm not sure I'll ever have an actual relationship. It gets lonely after a while."
