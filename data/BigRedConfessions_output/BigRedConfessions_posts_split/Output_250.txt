"I don't understand why the Black Student United feels the need to change the name of the plantations. The word plantation is ""a group of trees that have been planted together"". The history of the Cornell plantations was ""an arboretum of rare specimen trees and a conservatory for teaching botany"". The name seems to fit. The plantations are literally a place where plants were planted. 

The BSU accomplishes so many things that are sorely needed (need-blind admission, minority support, etc). I can't believe they are hanging their hat on this issue. And yes, before you all attack me, I am underrepresented minority but I am embarrassed to be associated with a group that overlooks pressing social issues to focus on meaningless titles."
