So lately a lot of confessions have been about depression and anxiety, both social and academic. And I want to do something to help but I have such a small voice, so this is all I say to you:

Chin up. Whether you believe it or not, there are people who will want to help you unconditionally. There are people who will want to help share the burden with you. If you need a person to vent to, a Cornell student like you, just reply to this post. There will definitely be at LEAST one person who reaches out to you.
