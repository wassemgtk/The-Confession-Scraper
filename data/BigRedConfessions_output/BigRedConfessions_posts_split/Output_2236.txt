I've never not gotten a job offer after interviewing. I've also never faked an answer to a question. If they ask me one and I don't actually know... I say "I don't actually know that much about that but I would love the opportunity to learn". Boom hired. As i've gone through college, the amount of questions I can't answer has gone down because now I've found the answers.
