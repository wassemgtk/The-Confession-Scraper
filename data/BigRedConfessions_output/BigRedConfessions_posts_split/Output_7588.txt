"I'm so glad Big/Little week is ending.  My roommate's Big texts me all the time during class and when I keep my phone on silent she panics and freaks out.  She always lets herself into my room and I keep having to participate in convoluted plans to keep her identity a secret from my roommate.

I can't wait to get my life back at the end of this terrible week."
