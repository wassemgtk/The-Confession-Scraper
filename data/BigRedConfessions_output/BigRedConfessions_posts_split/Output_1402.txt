I have no basis or evidence for believing this, but I think 95% of all confessions about "asexual" people on this site are full of shit. You're either lying or you've convinced yourself you're "asexual" to better deal with the reality of being lonely and/or embarrassment that you're still/always have been single and/or the judgement of others. Actual asexuality is incredibly rare. That's why you practically never hear about it. I don't want to single out any one confession, b/c that may just be the one that's honest, but statistics says the vast majority of you are full of shit. You are horny like the rest of us. Admit it to yourself and try to change the status quo.
