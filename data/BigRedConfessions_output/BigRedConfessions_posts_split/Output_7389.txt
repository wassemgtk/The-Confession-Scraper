Have you ever had the feeling where you want someone to say yes when they are going to say no? Or at least that is what you think is going to happen? I wish I just had the courage to ask him what i have been meaning to ask for a little while now, but I just have this burning feeling he will say no. I'll move on no matter what happens, but with him things could be so much better. He's so perfect. So please say yes when I ask you. "
