You're right; I did want you to call me (even if you were drunk).  I cut off contact because I feel rejected.  You broke my heart, you've made me unable to trust that love can be real and lasting.  So I can't contact you.  You can contact me though, and if you keep wanting to maybe you should rethink why that is.
