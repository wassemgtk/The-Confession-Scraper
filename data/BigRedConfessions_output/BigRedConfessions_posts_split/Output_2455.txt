Anyone looking at me would see a passionate, driven individual and a strong community leader. No one sees how lonely and tired I am since I can flawlessly mask how I feel. 

Despite my stength, the loneliness is starting to eat away at me slowly. I'm tired of coming home to an empty, alarmingly quiet apartment. I long for intimacy. I want to intricately explore the depths of someone's mind and body and find someone who wishes to do the same. Most aspects of my life are incredibly fulfilling but this emptiness in my heart just seems to grow day after day and there's nothing I can do about it except wait for someone worthwhile to come along and see if we connect.
