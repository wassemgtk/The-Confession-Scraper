So I just transferred to cornell and I fucking love it. But not having that one place where I can just chill and decompress alone is annoying not to have.. So I resorted to sometimes sitting on the steps next to the law school at like pretty late hours to just be alone and try to decipher my thoughts, you get me? But if you guys have any suggestions for a place like that than please let me know, if not I guess the steps next to the law school is my new "spot" lol
