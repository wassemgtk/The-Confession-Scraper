Srat girls sitting behind me in the stacks giggling loudly every 45 seconds- please stop. I'm sitting here struggling with material I only half know for a final in less than 12 hours and I'm just about to lose it. I'm begging you. Just go outside to any of the literally scores of group study spaces on campus and do it there. Just not here. Please. Have some empathy.
