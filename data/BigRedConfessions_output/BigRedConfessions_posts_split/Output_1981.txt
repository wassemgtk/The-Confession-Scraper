I don't hear back from employers, I don't hear back from dates, I don't hear back from people I'm trying to be friends with, I don't hear back from professional contacts I made at networking events... I barely hear back from my friends and family.

I get it. You're not interested. But at least show me some vestigial respect, some minimal amount of decency in letting me know. If there's silence, I really don't know what's going on and I have to email you twice before I realize you're not interested. And then I feel like a terrible person. And it hurts, it really does. Silence is 10 times worse than a rejection because it says not only do I want nothing to do with this person, I also have zero respect for him. I always get back to people. I just cannot fathom someone writing me a paragraph that they put effort into, politely asking me something and then my just thinking - oh fuck them. And yet, that's 90% of the interaction I have with people. I know it's my fault somehow, but it still hurts. It's often people I've done favors for or worked for or been extremely nice to too.
