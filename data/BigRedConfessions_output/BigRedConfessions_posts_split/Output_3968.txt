We met two summers ago, and I have had a crush on you ever since. I have never felt an emotional connection so strong with anyone before, and I was sure you felt the same way. We haven't really spoken since then but I think you still like me (at least I hope you still like me) and a large part of me wishes you would ask me out, even though I've given you no reason to believe that I would say yes. But I would say yes. I would definitely say yes.
