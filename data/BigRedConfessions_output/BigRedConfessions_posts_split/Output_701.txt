Ted Nugent is my favorite celebrity and I am a Cornell student. I love fast cars, guitars, and lots of guns like Ted. I am proud of Ted because he risked his life conducting drug raids with the DEA getting rid of drugs and locking up users and sellers. He is a proud supporter of the NRA and a 2nd amendment advocate and I even have his autograph hanging on my wall along with Donald Trump and Sheriff Joe Arpaio.
