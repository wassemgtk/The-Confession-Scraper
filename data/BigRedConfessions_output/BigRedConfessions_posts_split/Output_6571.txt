I really really like you. Seriously, you can ask all my close girlfriends who now know a ton of random stupid facts about you that would probably creep you out if you did ask them... But yesterday I had a dream that I slept with a guy that you're friends with and now I can't tell if I'm attracted to your friend (who is actually pretty cute and nice) or if my dream self wanted to make you jealous.
