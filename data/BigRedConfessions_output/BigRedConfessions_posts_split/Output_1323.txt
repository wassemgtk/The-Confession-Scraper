I really wish I were happy here. I would give so much for that to be the case. But three semesters in, and I just can't handle it anymore. I've submitted my transfer applications. Hopefully I get in somewhere. Either way, I want to give my thanks to the few good friends I have here and hope that none of you will resent me for my decision to leave.
