To the person who confessed that they miss their mom, well, let her know. That was an earnest and heartfelt emotion which I am sure she would really appreciate. She misses you too. It's been 14 months since I saw my family and it really hurts. And sometimes I feel like they are there but not quite, as if quietly and slowly fading away. But air travel is expensive and American visa regulations are convoluted. Well, I guess I can see them next summer!
