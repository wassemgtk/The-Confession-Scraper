A lot of confessions here are in the following format: "To the girl/boy with such wonderful physical appearance, you are so cute, let's be friends!”. I'd like just to argue that maybe an anonymous message is not the best way to impress someone and grab his/her attention! Maybe you need to be self confident and start a conversation unanonymously yourself. Quoting from the Gran Torino movie:
“I know I'm not always the most pleasant person to be around, but I got the greatest woman who ever lived to marry me. I had to work at it, but I got her and it was the best thing that ever happened to me. Hands down".
