What most women don't understand is that a lot of their suffering in relationships comes from the fact that they don't really evaluate the guy's character before entering a relationship or hooking up with him. 

But for men it's different. Men suffer because they can't get into a relationship or attract a woman in the first place. And feeling unlovable/invisible is even worse. It takes a toll in the guy's self-esteem and self-confidence, pushing him into a cycle of self-abandonment that can last for years and further diminishes his ability to attract women and increases his isolation. And when society, women, family and friends tell him "woman like a nice guy" and "just wait, I'm sure you'll find someone", he follows this advice and it doesn't work. Meanwhile, he sees all the women in his life get into relationships and having sex with guys they just met and/or treat them bad. 

And he feels bad, defective and ashamed. And he might even become angry, but that's not misogyny. Misogyny is anger towards women, simply because they are women. He is angry because he feels fooled and he perceives life as being unfair. He is just a human being that's hurt. And just as women, he also has a responsibility in his suffering. Because he's not been honest, with himself or with other people, and he's choosing to keep doing the same things that doesn't work.

And for the guys who identify with this, and for the hurt guy that still lives inside me, there's only one way out: integrity and working to become your best self. Just know that you're not alone, and don't give up. You deserve to be happy too.
