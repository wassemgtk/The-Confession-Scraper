I don't really enjoy being in my room with my roommate. It sucks because we were friends in high school, but now I just really can't stand him. He told me about a two months ago not to listen to anything without headphones when he's sleeping, which I understood and never do for his sake. But then he plays computer games and chats and talks loudly til 3 in the morning while I try to sleep, and isn't reciprocally considerate. He also always repeats how a class I'm in is easy, when I really don't need to hear his opinion and I don't think he should be qualified to criticize a class he's never been in. 

I understand people may  think I'm biased, but I really don't think I am in this situation. I was at fault I guess once when I would put my alarm for an early time and it would wake him up too; he told me he wanted to leave the room because of this (which is kind of drastic for just an alarm issue). I switched my alarm to a phone alarm and entertained his request out of consideration, even though it led to me missing class once. I just feel if I'm respecting his requests he should respect mine.
