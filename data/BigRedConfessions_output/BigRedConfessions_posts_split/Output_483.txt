You've got your food snobs, grammar snobs, beer snobs and even jacket snobs. What I am, and I'm not afraid to admit it although so many people will hate me for it, is a linguistics snob. I'm surrounded by my wonderfully intelligent English-first-language peers who sound like dipshits for the way they use the  language like a bratty bubble gum popping 8th grader. Examples? Yes. Like (the more times you can fit it into one breath, the better). Literally. Like literally. Then there are the adults, who do the same thing with their unimaginative corporate-speak that rubs off on my peers who then insult the language from every angle. Examples? You bet. Think outside the box. Let's circle back. Let's touch base. etc. Hate me if you will, but if you could only hear it from my brain...
