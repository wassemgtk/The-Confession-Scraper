My best friend stopped talking to me after I fell seriously ill. It's been a couple years, and I miss her everyday. I understand she had her own issues keeping her away, but I can't help but blame myself. Since she hasn't come back, I feel like I can't trust anyone and push myself away from people that claim to care about me. All my relationships now feel shallow, but I feel like I have no choice but to keep it that way. I wish I could be that close to someone again.
