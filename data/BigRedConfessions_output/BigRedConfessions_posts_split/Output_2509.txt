I think the idea of a sorority, a group of sisters to support you in good times and bad, sounds so wonderful. Here at Cornell I'm so far from home, and the idea of having a house and people to come home to seems really nice.

What puts me off is the reality of sororities. Watching 70-80 girls all dressed the exact same way (large shirt, Canada Goose coat, leggings, Uggs) parade through campus does not make me want to join. The informational meeting I attended at the beginning of last semester, where I was sitting in a room full of skinny white girls with long, straight hair, carrying expensive purses and tote bags, wearing short dresses and big chunky necklaces, just made me feel so out of place. Like I could feel everyone staring at me, wondering what the hell I thought I was doing there. Not to mention that, in the state where I'm from at least, sorority girls are known to be the cruelest, bitchiest, most stuck up people who will pretend to like you but secretly talk trash behind your back. All the ones I've known and met have done nothing but be pretentious to me because I have short, dyed hair and don't have the money to dress the way they do.

Obviously not every single sorority girl looks and acts the way I've described (I do know there are sororities dedicated to being multicultural and all), but I've just never actually had a good experience with these girls, and I feel like I could never fit in. I'm Hispanic, so I could join a Hispanic sorority, except I don't fit the stereotypical description of a Hispanic person (aka I'm pale and light haired), so I would feel like the odd one out. I'm bisexual, which scares people away for some reason, even though I'm in a serious relationship with a wonderful boy. I'm poor. I don't like shopping. I like marching band and hiking and animals and science, and I love playing video games and reading in my spare time. I keep my hair cut short and I love to dye it bright colors. I don't like wearing a lot of makeup. I'm most comfortable in jeans and a t-shirt, though I do really love dresses (just not super short, loose-fitted ones). 

I just feel like I could never belong in a sorority. Even if I could get in, I would always be the odd one out, and that would be so much worse than now. I don't think there's any such thing as a sorority for people like me.
