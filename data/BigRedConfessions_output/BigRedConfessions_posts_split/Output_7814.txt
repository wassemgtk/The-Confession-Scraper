F-ck you so much. What you did to me over christmas break was reprehensible. And right before we came back too. And then you NEVER reached out to me again. You left me abandoned staring at my computer in disbelief and crushing pain. Again. You made me feel less than worthless, and for that, you've made me hate you. I wish you hadn't contorted my love into hate but you have. Congrats, that's one hell of a feat.
