Hi Friend,

I feel this confession big time. You might get some comments in disagreement, but I would honestly say it's possible. Just use discretion. If you're honest without being overbearing and this person is worth your time, he'll at least respond. He might even appreciate the courage and spontaneity! From there, how you navigate that conversation will determine whether or not you can mitigate any lingering suspicion or awkwardness. Starting non-intrusively and casually, with a VERY brief message, shouldn't scare him away or weird him out to the point of completely ignoring you. If it does, he might be a bit of an asshole.

I've done the whole message thing and had success, and it's always best if you have a reason to want to talk to them. What is your relationship with this guy? Do you have overlapping social circles/interests on campus? Have you been in groups or classes together but never had a one-on-one interaction or exchanged words? Is there any other way you might be able to get in touch with him via a more in-person medium, an event, or a mutual friend? These are all things to consider, because I've also had some pretty memorable failures, but I'd need more context to really give you an informed suggestion. You're definitely not worse than me; I'm almost sure of it. All in the presentation! :)

Sincerely,
The most socially inept guy on the planet
