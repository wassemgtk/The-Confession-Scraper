I realized this past semester that I've got seasonal affective disorder. And while I am working on that, my withdrawal into depression resulted in me letting someone down. Majorly. And so I've been carrying around this tremendous amount of guilt for the past, what, five months. I finally really apologized and explained why what happened happened. And though I don't know if they even could forgive me, I feel physically better and more at peace with myself, like Zuko in "The Earth King." And that's really one of the best things that's happened all summer.
