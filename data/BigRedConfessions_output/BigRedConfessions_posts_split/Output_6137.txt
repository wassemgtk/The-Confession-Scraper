"I'm really tired of being the way that I am. I don't want to be like this anymore.

I'm tired of being gay. To me, it's just not worth it; it sucks! I'm never happy with life because of this, and it's ruined my life for about six years! How so? Back at home, I told a couple of my friends about my homosexual desires and stuff that's happened in middle school. But here at Cornell, I have yet to tell anyone. It's not because I'm afraid of a ruined friendship (everyone at Cornell is generally accepting either way, they should be) I just don't feel it's worth it to tell anyone about my problem. I just don't want to be gay. 

It's painful walking across campus and seeing really attractive guys that I know for sure are straight, they're just so manly (this isn't always the case, but generally is). It hurts to know that I can never have a relationship with them, only see them from afar as class is dismissed and just stare in awe at them (not creepily). Why do these guys have to be so cute? Ugh, I feel like I'm attracted to more guys on a daily basis than a straight male is attracted to girls on a daily basis (assuming he's single). Yeah, it sucks, and my parents won't be too fond of my decision if I come out. I know they won't reject me, they just don't support that behavior. 

When I was caught doing stuff with another guy in middle school, my parents where shocked and my mother was crying. She said her worst fear/nightmare came true, and that was her son being gay. I agree with my parents because if I go the complete gay route and hook up with a guy, I will never have the opportunity to biologically form a child of my own. I don't want to adopt a kid just because my sexuality won't allow me to biologically form one. I want a beautiful wife whom I can have children with. I think that's one of the most beautiful aspects of humanity: a guy finds his girl and they fall in love and have children that resemble each other. But I can't do that with a guy, unfortunately.

It's just a horrible situation to be in. It's not about coming out, it's about the frustration surrounding the fact that all the guys I see on campus are just going to mentally torment me as I remain forever alone. I'm also not looking for a LGBT community because I don't feel like I identify with them. I just don't want to be gay anymore, it has ruined me. 

I just want to be HAPPY and TRULY in love with a girl someday and not have to worry about anything else, just her and our children--our family, and life itself. 

Until then, I guess I'll start looking for a friend to confide in. I just have no idea what to do, I've tried forever and failed. Sigh.."
