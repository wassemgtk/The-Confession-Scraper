Whoever looked through my duffel bag in Mann on Friday: not cool dude. Not cool. I always take my wallet and valuables with me when I go to the bathroom or get up to go buy a drink/snack. I also always close my laptop so sleazy bastardos like you won't try and use it. But I thought there's a sacred understanding among all Cornellians that you don't fucking look through a man's shit when he's left the table for a few minutes. I don't want to have to pack up my back pack and all my things when I get up for a 5 or 10 minute bathroom/snack trip. Luckily for you, all you got a look at were my dirty gym clothes and wet towel from my shower this morning. Hope you enjoy the stank of dirty Indian sweat motherfucker. And next time close that shit to at least cover up your tracks. I should have beat your ass right then and thurrrr.
