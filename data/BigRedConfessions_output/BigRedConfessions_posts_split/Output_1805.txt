It took me 9 years to hit the bottom and realize I'm a sex addict. I was at Cornell until 2 years ago and during those 4 years as graduate student, I was spending 5 to 6 hours a day watching porn, chatting with strangers, and browsing the craigslist, masturbating behind my office desk and pool's locker rooms. I was Slope day staff that provided me more opportunity to act out. Last year, I hit the bottom and I had storm in my life. Since then, I go to sex addict anonymous meetings 3 times a week and therapy sessions once in a week. I have been sober for 14 months now and I live one day at a time.
