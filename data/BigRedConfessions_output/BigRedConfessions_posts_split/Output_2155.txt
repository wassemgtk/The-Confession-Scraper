Very confusing how people can sympathize and emphathize with a student committing suicide (As a normal human should) but can't do the same when unarmed people of color are killed by cops ðŸ˜• it's not funny to make suicide jokes but it's "funny" to joke about racism and oppressionðŸ˜’. Be consistent with your human emotions ppl otherwise there's a word to describe ppl like you....
