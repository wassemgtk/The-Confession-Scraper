I really really hate all the sorority hate that rears its head once in a while on anonymous forums (here and on yik yak). Mostly it makes me uncomfortable because it seems that a lot of people feel that way, and I can't help but be self-conscious if I'm wearing my letters. I wonder if people are judging me when they don't even know me. 

The vast VAST majority of us are nice, normal people. I don't look down on people not in the Greek system, I have a lot of non-affiliated friends, and I didn't become the wicked witch of the west when I joined, and I love my sorority so hop off.
