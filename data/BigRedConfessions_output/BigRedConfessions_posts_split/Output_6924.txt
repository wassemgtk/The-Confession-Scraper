I'm sorry if I seem distant, but this semester has been one of revelations and I'm suddenly seeing how much time I've wasted being with only one group of friends. College is supposed to be the best time of our lives, and I will no longer be stifled by people who may mean well, but are inherently oppressive or selfish.
