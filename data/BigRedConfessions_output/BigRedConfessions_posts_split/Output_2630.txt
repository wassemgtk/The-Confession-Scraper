I have a friend who is super radical and always posting statuses that raise awareness about racism, sexism, and other injustices in this country.  Which is great and that's why we're friends...but sometimes, he attacks people who comment just because they're white/heterosexual/a part of any majority. He said, "white people don't have any place in this discussion".

Dude, if you only allow minorities to be a part of this discussion, then you will never achieve the change you want...
