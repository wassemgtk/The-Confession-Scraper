I looked at myself in the mirror today after another grueling session at the gym and I can finally say that I won't be embarrassed to take my shirt off in public. I'd never share this with anyone in the real world b/c it sounds extremely douchy, but this has been a source for self-hatred my entire life. I'd always been a scrawny nerd, always bullied, and to finally have that start to change has been an accomplishment comparable to getting into Cornell. Few things bring as much happiness as progress, and seeing that hard work has paid off.
