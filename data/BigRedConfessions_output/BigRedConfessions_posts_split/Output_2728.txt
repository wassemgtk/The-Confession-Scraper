No one would let me drop a class. They told me to stop playing a sport or to quit my job. Then they got mad that I kept doing poorly in the class. Honestly, school is so depressing for me that I play sports to stay sane, and I work because i need to fucking pay for this god damn school you fucking stupid bitch. Let me drop your fucking class I hate you and I hate having so much work and sleeping for two hours a night.
