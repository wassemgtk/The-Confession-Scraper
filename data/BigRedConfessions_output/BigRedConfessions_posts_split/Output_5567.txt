On Mother's Day, my mom ended up in the hospital-- luckily for something relatively minor that let her go home right away. But it was a reminder that as soon as I'm out of here, as soon as I'm back home, I have to make sure she doesn't work so hard. She's worked hard for two decades to take care of me, now I can take care of her.
