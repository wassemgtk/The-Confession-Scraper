Adding on to the confession about how I took on a leave of absence (the confession submitted just a few minutes ago):

My advice to any of you who are doing poorly in school and have a lot on your plate--go seek help now. Don't be like me. I have a shitty GPA and will probably end up graduating when I'm fucking 26 years old since I have to find work to pay for school since my parents have shelled out more than enough.
