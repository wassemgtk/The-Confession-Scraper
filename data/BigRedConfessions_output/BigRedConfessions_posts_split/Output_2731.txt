I had an amazing first semester. Met a girl who i completely fell for, and she fell for me. 

and i can really say I expressed real love- i was there for her, and didn't expect anything in return. I guess I still love her as a person.

but in these past couple of weeks I feel like i've finally learned who she really is. i felt emotionally abused, neglected, and horrible about myself. i was there for her and when she was ok, she wasn't there for me- all of this which she admitted without blinking.

so I'm sitting at the diner at columbia with my friend and he pulls up the definition for the word 'sociopath,' and we find out she fit the criteria perfectly...
