"It was around 12:40am of Nov 1 when I bumped into a former student of mine together with her Asian female friend somewhere in west campus. It seemed like her friend had something to drink but I could not ascertain since I do not go to parties and am not familiar with behaviors influenced by alcohol.

My student and I caught up briefly (she's very sweet!) but her companion was getting a bit impatient and started wandering off. Her companion was calling my student every now and then, motioning her that they already had to go. I kept on insisting my student that we have to cut the conversation because her friend's already calling her. But my student, being her sweet self, said that she sees her friend everyday but rarely sees me and carried on chatting with me. It got to the point when her companion got so irate that she approached us and started yelling at me that she has been ""fucking"" calling my student again and again that they had to leave already.

At that moment, I just froze. I did not know how to react and just said sorry a couple of times. I found it shocking that her Asian friend had to shout at me that they had to leave. Even more appalling is her use of foul language. Thoughts then started racing through my head...could it merely be the influence of alcohol (although it did not seem that she was half drunk even)? Why could she not have politely ushered my student out instead of shouting at me?

The second thought made me think how such a privileged person acted in a despicable manner. It made me think whether living in America is an excuse to eschew Asian values of respect.

But even more so, what haunted me that night was the thought that: If I were white, would she have acted rudely towards me? It still scares me to this point.
