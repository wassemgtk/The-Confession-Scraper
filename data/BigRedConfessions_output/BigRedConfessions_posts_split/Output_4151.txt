My long distance boyfriend asked me for an open relationship about a week and a half ago because he felt lonely and wanted to sleep around since I was not there. I broke up with him because I was so hurt. He took my virginity only two months ago. Since then I've slept with 14 guys and regret none of it. It makes me feel in power. I think I have a problem because I don't feel like I am done. I think I am just looking for affection again.
