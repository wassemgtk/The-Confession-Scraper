"i'm openly gay but my boyfriend is still in the closet. as cheesy as it sounds, one day i want us to hold hands together as we walk ho plaza or the arts quad or just about any place on campus

but he's afraid his friends will find out, so the most he'll do is give me a bro hug. i'm pretty sure his friends already know since they see us together all the time. but, i realized this would happen when i entered the relationship with him. i love him. and so i will be patient. but it would be nice."
