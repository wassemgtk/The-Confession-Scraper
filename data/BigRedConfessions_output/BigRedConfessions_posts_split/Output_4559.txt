My dad withdrew my tuition payment because I pierced my nose and now I can't figure out if it's worth it for me to leave the piercing or if I should just cave and let him win again. He is very controlling and he said I'm not welcome in my home while I have a nose ring. I want to have a good relationship with him but is doing whatever he tells me to really going to get me there?
