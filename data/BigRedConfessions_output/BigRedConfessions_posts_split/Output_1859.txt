I have anorexia. As a guy with anorexia it's hard to notice. But there's a reason I drink diet sodas and eat lettuce with lemon juice even though I'm skinny. Yes I know the ice cream is amazing, but I don't really like ice cream. Did I fool you? Of course I love ice cream, I'm just terrified to eat it. But suddenly going from 800 calories a day to 5000 a day by losing control of myself is terrifying. Yes I just ate 4 muffins in a row, yes I'm about to eat as much as I can before I'm doubled over in pain. No, this isn't a white girl's problem. It's hard concentrating in class when all you think about all the time is food. Life for me is just waiting for the next meal. Sometimes I sleep to pass the time until I can eat again. One day I'd like to try Cornell Ice Cream or Louie's, or CTP, or maybe eat an apple without having a 10 minute debate about it to myself.
