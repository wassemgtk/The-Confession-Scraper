To the people that gather around Ho Plaza vigorously advertising their events to everyone that walks by, PLEASE STOP! I don't want to see your improv interracial whatever show, I don't want to hear about whatever cause your working towards and why you NEED my money, and I don't want you to shove flyers into my face! I have a busy schedule and don't have time to stop and say no thank you to the line of people that literally block my path. I often consider alternate paths to avoid you people. You are free to waste your own time but stop trying to waste mine!
