I think finding Jesus again in my life was the best thing that could have happened to me. I love to go to Sage Chapel when no one is there and in peace and solitude pray for the well being of this country and the world. I hope one day Jesus will make us live in peace again throughout the ends of the world so that all religions can co-exist in peace. I like to sing I Know That My Redeemer Lives by Scott Soper and hear my voice echo through the high ceilings when I am alone in Sage Chapel. With Jesus I no longer feel small in what was once a dark and large world, and I can come to understanding the reason why things happen the way they do. Sage Chapel is my favorite place to be on campus even when I am alone because I feel like I am one with God. May God Bless everyone at Cornell and around the world so that we may one day live in peace. I pray that one day God will also unite me with my soulmate so that we can get married in God's house and live through and spread his word. I also hope that those who are in darkness and despair may one day find his calling and live in peace. To the student who sometimes preaches outside of Willard Straight Hall about finding God, may he also bless you and give you strength for sharing his word. Amen.
