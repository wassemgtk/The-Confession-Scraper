I get really annoyed when people smoke in a public place, and even worse, RIGHT in front of a no-smoking sign. I try to tell people sometimes when we are standing in the same place for a while, but they just think I'm a jerk. How am I the jerk when I'm not the one hurting other people? People have actual breathing problems.
