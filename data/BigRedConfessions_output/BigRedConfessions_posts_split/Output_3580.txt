I have a crush on this really nice and cute guy  I met in my bio class last semester. He is funny and caring and always well-dressed, and once we started talking we became pretty close. Too close, since he placed me right in the friend zone.

This guy spent all of fall semester trying to get some other girl, and somehow I ended up being the comforter person whenever things didn't turn out well. Towards the end of it all, he finally got over it and admitted she wasn't gonna date him - but instead of noticing the girl that was right next to him, he decided he still wasn't over his ex back home. Now, I'm still the comforter person over thousands of miles because she doesn't want long distance and he's still fucking heartbroken.

I'm still gonna wait for him, but sometimes, I want to smack his silly face until he realizes I like him.
