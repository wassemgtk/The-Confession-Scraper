"My ex and I broke up over several. So I should have completely moved on by now, am I right? Particularly considering that I haven't spoken to him properly in over a year. Then why am I a pathetic loser that still gets affected by what he does?
Last Christmas, my best friend told me that this particular ex has been hitting on her for quite a while, saying things to her that he probably never said to me. It hurt. It hurt like a motherfucking sonofabitch. But I internalized the anger as much as I could, and tried not to hate my friend and channel my rage only towards my ex. I ended up sleeping with a guy my bestie had a crush on, over New Year's. And a week later, she met my ex over drinks. I embraced the possibility of something happening there. I probably deserved it as well. Again, it hurt but I pretended like I didn't care and got through this year. Gradually, I fell back in my old pattern of blaming myself for the break-up and wondering if I could have done something to fix it.
This year, my bestie is back to visit me over New Year's and she brought up the ex again in conversation. It seems that my worst fears were true. They did kiss, but that's all, she said. He has been constantly dogging her for sex over the year: sending unsolicited dick pics, asking for nudes, video sex and all that stuff that she is not even comfortable with. The thing that was the worst was that he sent her a dick pic while she was in my house, with me, and told her that it would be so much fun to see how I would react if I saw that he was sending her nudes. While this grossed her out too, I think something in me broke.
I thought I was over him last year. But the loneliness of grad school, and being in your mid twenties and not knowing what one wants out of life, can become a black hole of self pity and depression. So I kept thinking that I could have done something to fix things and have him back. But, I think that I have never hated someone as much as I have hated him in my life. I hate him. And I think I hate living."
