There are many different types of people. I would like to talk (or vent) about two of the many types.

The first is ones like me. Though I'm generally nice to people, I also hate and despise many people. I don't really try to hide my hatred, but at the same time, I never had to confront. In result, people, except very few whom I call my friends, often find me rude.

The second is ones that I have problem with these days. They are nice. Well, to be precise, they act nice. Everyone ( well majority of them) thinks they are the nicest on the campus.

One of the second types started to hate me. I can understand why she would hate me but it's reaching a level that I can't really understand. However that's not a problem at all for me. I don't really care if she hates me or not. I can casually ignore her with no problem. The problem is our mutual friends/acquaintances. Since I'm not the 'nicer' one, as she (somewhat) publicly speaks about her problem with me, everyone seems to believe it. I guess it's my fault that I never tried to defense myself. But why should I? especially when I did nothing wrong.

It's kind of annoying that people are so gullible with such fragmented information. I guess it filtered true friends for me.
