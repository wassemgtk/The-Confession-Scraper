When people say being at Cornell is one of the best four years of their lives, are most of them lying? This has been one of the worst four years of my life and I know it is for a lot of people, so I sure as hell wouldn't saying that cliche crap at my graduation. 
    From Yik Yak and this page, it seems Cornell is mentally traumatizing a lot of people  (from regular stress to fantasies of suicide)  but people are only vocal in anonymity and publicly pretend everything is okay. Heck, I know most of you agree with this post but won't even like it because you are ashamed what your friends or family may think.
    Now the people who like it here can go ahead and throw tomatoes. Tell me to get the hell out and transfer like you always do, and let's avoid the fact that this is a serious issue in this school.
