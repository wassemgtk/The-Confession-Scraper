I must be the saddest person in the history of the universe! It's been a year since I had sex, a year and a half since I had sex sober and four years since I have had a boyfriend. I am not ugly (I hope) and while I might come of as obnoxious cos of my pointedly liberal and feminist believes, I am a nice person overall. I am chill, cool, drink wine and whiskey with equal ease and I am open to trying out anything. Then why am I so lonely and desperate? I mean, I get it, guys my age are not looking for serious relationships and neither am I. I would like a sweet, nice guy who I can hang out with, talk to and have sex with. Or maybe just even have sex with, at this point! Is that too much to ask????
