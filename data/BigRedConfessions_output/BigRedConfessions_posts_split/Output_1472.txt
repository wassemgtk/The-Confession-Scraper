Lately, people have been asking about my plans after Cornell, especially when they learn I'm taking time off before medical school. I always find myself giving vague, halfhearted replies about work or graduate school. Truthfully, I know exactly what my plans are, and where I see myself in the long run. I learned a long time ago, that not everyone needs to know everything. While this is not true for everyone, some people are so evilhearted they will purposefully stand in your way, because they cannot fathom the idea of someone else's success. Also, I'm not simply referring to acquaintances or classmates, this includes my advisers and professors, and others. Only my  family and my few friends whom I love very much have been privileged to know certain things about me that might seem uncharacteristic to others and I plan on keeping it that way.
