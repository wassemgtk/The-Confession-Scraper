I am depressed. I broke up with my boyfriend over a month ago and my mother immediately started to pressure me to date other guys. She thinks that my life is over if I do not secure a boyfriend in college, and it makes me incredibly depressed to attempt to date random people. In fact, I am very in love with my boyfriend and I am not over him. I also hate how my mother never cares about my academics or professional life. To her, the most important thing about a young woman is her personal family life.
