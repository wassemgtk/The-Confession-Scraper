"To the person who blew up that balloon doll: Thank you for that half minute of discomfort.  
But to the thousands of people who surrounded me, partied with me and sang with me: Thank you for making me feel comfortable the entire day. Thank you for making it one of happiness, fun and unfiltered joy.Turn down for what? This was my first Slope Day and I'm going to keep coming back! Again and again and again. Person with the doll: I want you to come back too. Maybe I can teach you the correct dance moves you do when listening to a Ludacris song <3
