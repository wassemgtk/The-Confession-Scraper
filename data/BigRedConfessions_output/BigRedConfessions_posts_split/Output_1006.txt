In response to 7016:

I completely understand where you are coming from. I see myself as an individual, not defined by my race, and I'v been looked down upon for it (by black people and other races). At the end of the day, be who you want to be. Not every minority has the same story, and we don't have to live within the confines of racial stereotypes.
