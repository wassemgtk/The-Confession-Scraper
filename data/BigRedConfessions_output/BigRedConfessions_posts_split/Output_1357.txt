To the guy I saw on College Ave. last night wearing the tied midriff shirt, wig, eye shadow, and small floral-printed shorts: even though the friends you were rolling with weren't supportive of your costume, I think you looked *damn* good. If I didn't have a bus to catch, you definitely could've picked me up ;) Thirst aside lol, I hope you had a really good Halloween night!
