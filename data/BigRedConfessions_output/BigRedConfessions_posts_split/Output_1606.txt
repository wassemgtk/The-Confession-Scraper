I don't even miss the boy I broke up with that much. Long distance wasn't going to work for us. What makes me upset is seeing so many of the boys here at Cornell string girls along and cheat and manipulate girls they know are interested in them. It makes me feel like I let go of one of the only guys who was mature and honest and kind.
