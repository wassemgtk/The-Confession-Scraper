I'm a Cornell grad and I was premed. I watch a lot of my friends let go of there dreams one by one because the curve told them they were not as good as the average . I chose to challenge the mean and now I'm a med student because medicine is about passion and that's what medical schools want (and you go to Cornell so needless to say you're smart). Stay true to your cause and make your time at Cornell as fun as possible so that one day, you wont get all nostalgic whenever Denice Cassaro sends an email that reminds you of all the events you skipped to study for tests that you dont remember and didn't matter.
