He's probably going to marry her.  How do I stop thinking so negatively about myself?  Am I attracting alone-ness?  I think I'm a likable person...  I hope I am.  I have a lot of problems, but I do try to take care of myself.  I'm compassionate, and goofy.  I don't know.  I just want someone to spend real quality time with.  Someone to wake up happy to think about.
