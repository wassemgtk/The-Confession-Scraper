I applied early to Cornell. Got in, was thrilled, sent in my deposit. But now, I'm... not sure, I guess. I don't know if its just general nerves or what but I'm getting cold feet. Will I be happy? Make friends? Not flunk out? I know this sounds stupid and I should be grateful and excited (and I am!) but I'm kinda freaking out... :/
