Dear the girl at Olin cafe at 2:24 pm May 10th with the red sorority bag

Don't, Do Not, really don't cut the fucking line. Everyone was stressed. I was watching the whole time while you pretended as if you were just checking what's in the freezer, grab the green gatorade turned around to see where the end of line was and then sneaked right in front of that innocent looking asian guy. Don't do it ever again.

If you are a sorority girl, spread this to your sisters.
