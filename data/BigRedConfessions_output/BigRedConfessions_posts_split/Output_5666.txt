All of these end-of-the-year and senior events just remind me of how much I've wasted the past four years sulking, not taking risks, not talking to new people and making solid bonds, and not accepting Cornell as it is. I could've had a much better, maybe even possibly great time here, if only I was willing. Any underclassmen reading this: these four years will go by way faster than you expect, and this short time is only what you make of it. Shitty times will happen, but these can be the funnest four years of your life if you let it.
