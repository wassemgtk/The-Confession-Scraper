Today I walked up the slope carrying 40 pounds of jars and a 30 pound backpack panting, falling over, and visibly upset. Not one person offered to help until I got to right in front of MVR. Shout out to the guy who helped me carry the jars through MVR. I wish I had gotten your name because you ARE that one person that doesn't give in to the bystander effect. You deserve a medal.
