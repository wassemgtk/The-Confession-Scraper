I feel like the only reason I am still at this school is because I've already gone through 3 years so I might as well finish. I honestly don't see a Cornell diploma giving me an advantage in the industry I want to go into, but everyone is so nice here and I really do learn a lot. I feel like I belong here. But I have been doubting myself ever since a girl I knew in the same high school program as me, (but 3 years ahead of me) who went to a school specifically for this field, got my dream job. I want to do something that I love, but I don't know if I am on the right path to get there, or if Cornell has prepared me enough to do the job I wish I could get.
