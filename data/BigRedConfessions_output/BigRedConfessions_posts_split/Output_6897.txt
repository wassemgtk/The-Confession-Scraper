We had one drunk hookup, which was fine, but I see you all over the place--at parties, at the club we're both in, I pass you at least once a day somewhere on campus. All of our interactions thus far have been super awkward and I have exactly no clue how you feel about me. Really, I'd like to just talk it out or something so we can have normal interactions because the awkwardness is increasing at an exponential rate and I dread encountering you.
