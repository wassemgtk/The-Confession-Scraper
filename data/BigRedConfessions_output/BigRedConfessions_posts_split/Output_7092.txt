you annoy the living hell out of me. if I didnt live with you and we were friends I would have ended this friendship long ago. you are one of the MOST negative, self-serving people I have ever met. You bring me down when you talk endlessly about your problems and the second I try to talk about mine, you story- top me. you are bossy and you just want everyone to pity you. you have no consideration for those around you who are suffering. you dont realize how priveledged you are for having such a wonderful family at home and being well off at an ivy league institution. I cannot stand the way you react to others who are both more and less fortunate than you. You criticize those who have more than you and belittle the problems of those who have less than you. You can do nothing on your own and constantly need others to do things for you, and even then you are not grateful for their help, you dont even acknowledge that they might have gone out of their way for you. you over-analyze anything and everything to the point of annoying everyone around you. Ive tried SO hard to be friends with you and youve taught me that you just cannot be friends with everyone, there are people that are bad for you-- and if you cant help them you should just stay away from them.
