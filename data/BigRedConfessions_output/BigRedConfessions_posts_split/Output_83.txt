I feel like we are genuinely attracted to each other, and it makes me happy just to be with you.  But sometimes I don't know what you're thinking or whether or not you want to go somewhere with this.  Some days, we talk to each other nonstop, and on other days, there's only a couple messages over the internet.  You're experienced and you know this is completely new to me; are you waiting for me to give some sort of sign?
