To #7604 about the person's dad not approving of him going to college & feeling stifled. Sorry in advance for the long post. 

I just want to say that I understand what you are going through. Half of the time, I feel defiant and assured that I am doing the right thing for my own happiness. The other half of the time I feel guilty because my parents do not support what I am doing. I am interning in a field I am interested in and learning a lot, however not earning any money. My parent's mantra, almost every night without fail: "get a government job, they're stable." I KNOW, without a doubt, that it is not what I want to do. That I would be bored out of my mind.

The turning point in my thinking came when I went with my friend & his lifelong pet to the vet. This dog was his best friend, and it turned out that her condition was so bad she had to be put down. I've never seen him so vulnerable in his entire life, and the one thing that struck me was that he said: "I should have treated her better, yelled at her less, let her go outside when she wanted to.." He was filled with so much regret that he could have been the cause of even a little bit of unhappiness in her life. 

I guess my point is that you have the option to work with your dad doing physical labor, but in the end and in the long run, will your dad regret that he held you back from your happiness?
