There's not enough people on this campus that truly love movies. Every time I get into a serious talk about films with people who proclaim to love to watch films, I almost always outclass them in knowledge and understanding, and then I feel like I am explaining to much and the conversation becomes very one side. I am not saying I don't like hearing myself speak, but I would prefer a real conversation, to expand my mind, than a simple one sided teaching session.
