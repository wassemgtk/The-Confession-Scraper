I guess my real confession is the shortest of forms is ths: As an Asian female, I can't watch Fresh Off the Boat with my white boyfriend. 

I recognize that in a post racial society, we’re not supposed to see race as an important construct.  To a certain extent, I don’t.  I’ve dated Asian guys, black guys, white guys, and Indian guys, a clarifier that apparently needs to be applied because of some confusion on what exactly constitutes as “Asian.”  But I’ve never had a problem relating with others, falling in love, and being heart broken by any person before.  But today, I was snuggled on his bed and opened my laptop to play Fresh Off the Boat for the first time, my boyfriend flippantly said "This show is going to be cancelled." 

At that moment, when my white boyfriend couldn’t understand my hope for this show, I realized that there are certain experiences that could never be fully and completely translated to him, that there is a part of my life that hours of conversations cannot make him understand. This lack of understanding though is what makes Fresh off the Boat such a gratifying and necessary phenomenon.  I think that having a show that tries to authentically and engagingly describe what it's like to feel like an outsider in a country you've called home your entire life broadcasted to millions of Americans is something we Asian Americans have desperately wanted.  We haven't had a show like this since All American Girl (which only made Asian moms seem too stereotypically stern and Asian grandmothers eccentrically awesome).  

But it startled me and saddened me how hopeful I was for this show.  It wasn't until today that I realized how much we as a group are relying on Eddie Huang to pull this off, and how fragile out faith is in that.
