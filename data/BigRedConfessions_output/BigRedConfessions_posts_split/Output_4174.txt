"I've always thought that I was emotionally healthy but now I increasingly feel that there is something fundamentally wrong with the way I view the world and my interactions with others. I think that I'm independent, that I don't need strong emotional bonds with others, that they don't know who I really am and I don't want them to know that either. In some ways, I am an intensely private person. I only let my friends and family see a part of me, the part of me that I am proud of, the part of me that is normal and unconcerning. No one knows what I really feel, or what I really think. I feel like inherently I'm not a good person, that I have a lack of values, and I am afraid of showing that to my friends because they would hate me for being who I am. I don't want to lose the friends I have, because even though I don't share everything about myself with them, I love spending time with them and really value their friendship. As time passes, I feel myself retreating more and more into myself and getting colder and more uncaring as a person. When anyone pushes me emotionally, when anyone gets upset at me, I harden my heart and put up my walls. I tell myself that that's just a method of self-protection and self-preservation, but sometimes I feel guilty for not being a better person. It is stressful and tiring, trying to reach out and share more of myself, trying to care more about others, trying to be considerate, and in the end I get exhausted with this, and think to myself how much easier it would be if I had no ties, no obligations in this world. If I could do what I wanted and never feel guilty. If I never had to answer to anyone but myself. If I could completely close my heart to the world around me. If I didn't have to worry about people who cared about me. And it takes so much effort to not do just that. Everytime I hurt someone I hate myself a little for not being caring or considerate enough, that something that could come so naturally to others I struggle with. Increasingly I wish people wouldn't care about me so I wouldn't get a chance to hurt them. 

It has been ingrained in me for a very long time to select certain parts of myself to cater to certain people and their expectations of me. I have been told by several people that there are different facades of me that they've never known about, and that I've 'changed' and 'become a different person' from the person they've known, but in actual fact, all these facades make up the real 'me' and that fundamentally I'm still the same person. Just because hanging out with a certain group brings up a part of me more strongly doesn't mean I'm being fake or deceptive. It has also been ingrained in me not to rely on others for emotional support and to look out for myself, that I have the power to make myself happy, and that I deserve happiness. 

I don't know how to change this, and I don't know if I even want to change. I wish I could go back to the time where I was happy with who I was and did not doubt my value as a fellow human being."
