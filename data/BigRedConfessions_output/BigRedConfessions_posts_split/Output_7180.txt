"I've often wondered how the elderly get so racist (read: how it seems people get more racist with age). This year, thanks to my current living situation, I've realized, ""This is it. This is how it happens."" Thanks to my roommate, I now automatically think that a whole group of people must also be terrible human beings and want nothing to do with them. I know it's wrong (believe me I know it), but it's just so hard to fight this feeling.

I am normally a kind person. But upon this one person, I wish the worst; I wish a lifetime of loneliness, of debt, of disease, of the blackest pit of sadness upon this one person.

I hope all of the cheese slides off every pizza slice you ever get.
I hope you pour a bowl of cereal before you realize there's no milk in the fridge.
I hope you wash your hands and your sleeves get wet.
I hope you drop your phone into the toilet.
I hope you step on a Lego. "
