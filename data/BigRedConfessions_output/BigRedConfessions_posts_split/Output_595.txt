I feel like I'm not doing well at college, especially as compared to my friends. Last semester was a disaster for me GPAwise. It wasn't all that bad, but put it together with the bare minimum course load I took, it is pitiful. In terms of outside the classroom activities, I am happy. I got a job, got involved with three clubs, lost elections in one and went to a couple college parties as well. But I'm not doing all that well in my personal life. I am slowly phasing out my friends from back home. I ignored my parents the entire last week. They had to call my roommate. I feel disconnected from the "friends" I have here. I should be counting my blessings. It is a huge deal to just be attending a school like Cornell and to avail all the opportunities that come with it, but what use is it if my rubbish grades can't even get me a decent job. I probably shouldn't be worrying about my grades so much, but I came from a background where grades meant everything. I am trying to cope with it all and I know I could seek help with EARS and CAPS, but I feel like doing that would solidify my problem. This is a very badly written rant and I would like to apologize to the reader, but writing helps me clear my head and that's something I could really use right now. Ugh. I feel like punching a wall.
