I'm sorry but that is awful advice. You're basically saying forget passion, be practical. How could you advise someone you truly care about to settle for an unfulfilling career for the next decade?Some people have souls. If this person truly feels that art is their calling, have demonstrated the ability to succeed as an artist, and will do whatever it takes to live their dreams everyday, nothing will stop them. Not their parents, friends, or you. When someone is willing to leave engineering for art, maybe they never wanted to be engineer. When we decided how to spend the rest of our lives in high school as teenagers, some of us got it wrong, some of us were pressured by society,parents, egos, etc. 
Anyway, most people here have some form intelligence, I'm sure your friend has considered the risks. Clearly, you're afraid, maybe you aren't happy with your prospective career? Your friend isn't afraid and they have proven such.
