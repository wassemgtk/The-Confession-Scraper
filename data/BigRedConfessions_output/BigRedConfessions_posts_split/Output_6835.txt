To all the "nice guy" comments, in my experience, if a friend has asked me who you are or what you're like, when I say nice (and it comes out sounding unsatisfactory) it's because I would only choose that word if there is nothing else to say about you. You aren't funny, we are at one of the top universities so normal smart here doesn't warrant the adjective smart, and you're not a dick. You're kinda boring (but no one really describes another person outright with that term). We'll be friendly acquaintances. Sorry.
