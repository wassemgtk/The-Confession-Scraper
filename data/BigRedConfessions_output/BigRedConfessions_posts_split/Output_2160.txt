I've been hooking up with one of my guy friends for a while. At first, very occasionally. Then not at all for a while this year because I was dating someone and he was hooking up with someone else. But since spring break it's been pretty regular, and I'm struggling to figure out what to do because I'm really starting to like him as more than a friend or a FWB. I know he doesn't feel the same way about me at all. Not that he doesn't like me, because we really are friends, but he just doesn't feel that way about me. I don't know if I should broach the subject (probably a very bad idea), stop hooking up with him or, more likely, keep fucking him and being friends and letting my silly desperate angst slowly eat away at me. Because I know it's only a matter of time before he finds someone he likes more and it's all over. 

Moral of the story: FWBs never works and I am going to die alone.
