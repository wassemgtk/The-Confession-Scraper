The reason why I like guns over illegal drugs is because most crimes involve drugs, but very few involve firearms. If the crime involves firearms, there is a 90% chance that person was high on legal or illegal drugs. Plus, the 2nd amendment guarantees my freedom to own a gun, no where is it written that drugs should be legal. Personally, if we had a Singapore or even better Saudi Arabia style ban, we would be better off in this country like we were before the 1960's when the red diaper doper babies infested this country with drugs.
