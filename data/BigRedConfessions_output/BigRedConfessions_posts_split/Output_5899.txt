The hypocrisy here is hilarious. To all the people (especially girls) giving the guy “trying to get some pussy” a hard time: if it was a girl “trying to get some dick,” would you have been as quick to judge her? Call her a slut? Tell her there’s something wrong with her? Who gives a shit how he expressed himself, crude or not? Whether he wishes he had “someone to be intimate with” or “someone to fuck,” the basic premise is the same, and a sentiment echoed by many, if not most of the people here, male or female. Maybe if you lowered your pious waving finger just a bit, you could see that. He wants to have sex. I want to have sex. You want to have sex. We all want to have sex (most of us, anyway). The fact that he can’t get any has nothing to do with the fact that he wants pussy, because guess what? Most of the guys having sex “want some pussy,” and yet there they are, having sex.

Grow the hell up, losers.
