"This university is such a breath of fresh air! I went to a high school where, despite their complaints with the system, the students had no inclination to challenge the authority's decision.

Here at Cornell, people have an amazing amount of passion and will! I really want to dedicate this post to all of those involved in #fightthefee . Thank you for your passion. Thank you for taking time out of your lives to provide justice in this system. And thank you for all you are doing. You guys are what make me proud of attending this university and truly inspire the rest of the student body to never give up"
