So a lot is made/said of the fact that once you're here you're no longer the smartest person in your area, and adjusting/coping with that, esp. since so many of you were top people in your class/school/etc. But I for one love that about this place, the fact that I can be defined for my actual personality rather than just stereotyped as a nerd or something else just cause of my grades. I can try my best with the assurance that I won't be labelled for it and in that label-less void I can choose what I want to be labelled and known as, and be able to embrace and laugh at the fact that frankly, I'm an idiot around here. Yeah, it's an insecure feeling, and it sucks with the pressure of classes and whatnot to feel inferior or less smart than others, but take some time to really think about what a great opportunity it is, we're all here cause we're smart and chances are before Cornell and once we go out in the real world with the Cornell label we'll never have much of a chance to shape our own label. But for 4 years over here we can escape that and truly find our personality, and that, frankly, is just amazing, and is probably the biggest reason I love this beautiful place
