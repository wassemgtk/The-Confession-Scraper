I am a crappy queer.  I am.  I'm a gun-loving free-market capitalist, who hasn't come out to my extended family because I don't want to cause them stress, not because I need them.  My life goals are to get one life partner, and raise cats while working happily at a corporate job.  America isn't broken, Citizens United made sense, and Obamacare only made it harder to be working poor.  

And it's a damn good thing I'm bisexual, because the odds of finding another queer woman in this place who thinks I'm not crazy is seems like looking for a needle in a haystack, but worse.
