I don't miss being in a relationship with you. I miss having someone to talk to, who knew my every wish and every fear.  You are the only person, outside of my family, who has seen me at my worst, crying and shaking in panic, and the only person who somehow knows, instictively it seems, how to comfort me. 
I don't love you anymore, but I don't know how to function without your support. I wish being friends with an ex was not as taboo as it's been made out to be. I wish I had the courage to open up emotionally to my friends the way I did with you. I don't know what to do.
