"I've fallen in love with my straight friend, and I mean head over heels. I wasn't even interested in him when we first met, but every day I found something we shared an interest in, from photography to indie bands, and one day I realised that he's the kind of guy I want to spend my life with. And it hurts that I don't even have a chance with him.
His next girlfriend better hold onto him tight because he's the best she'll ever get, and I doubt she'll realize how lucky she is."
