I honestly cannot stand racism. I am doing clinical research in a state that does not have a lot of diversity this summer and there is this one nurse who is constantly rude to me. I greet her good morning but she never replies. She finds any excuse to call me out in a very aggressive voice. I really didn't understand her hostile behavior until today when I overheard her making an offensive remark about "brown people".  Now I really just want to this internship to end.
