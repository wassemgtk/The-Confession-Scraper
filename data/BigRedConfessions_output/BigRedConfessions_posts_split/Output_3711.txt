"When I was 4, my younger brother died when our van burned down because my dad was too drunk to get him out.
When I was 9, my dad, who had spent the last four and a half years in prison and who had blamed my mother for everything that happened, returned only to kill her after dinner when I was watching cartoons.
Between the ages of 9 and 13, I lived in two separate foster homes where I was beaten, molested, and verbally abused day after day.
But apparently my hardships don't mean anything.  Apparently I should sit down and shut the fuck up because I've had a privileged life as a white male.
