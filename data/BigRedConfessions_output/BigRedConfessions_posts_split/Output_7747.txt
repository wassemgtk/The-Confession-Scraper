You are worthless because your girlfriend cheated on you? Nope. She's worthless. You didn't cheat or betray her. She cheated on you and then lied to your face. This is on her. She's a selfish person. She wanted to have her cake and eat it, too. Putting yourself down for something she did makes zero sense. She's garbage. You're just too blind to see it right now.
