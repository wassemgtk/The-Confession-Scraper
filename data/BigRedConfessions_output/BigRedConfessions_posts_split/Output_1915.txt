I work at a popular restaurant in Ithaca and I can not tell you how rude and disrespectful people are. It does not matter who you are, people feel entitle to treating you like shit. I am nothing my nice to my customers. I am very soft-spoken and often try my best to please the customer. Some how it is not enough. I can not help the price change, delivery charge, tax, or whatever coupons we happen to accept or not accept anymore (I had a person threaten me because they could only use a coupon up to a certain amount. People have been abusing these things forever and no one was abiding by the coupon rules so instead of taking it away we made sure each customer could break their coupons to the maximum amount as well as get a refund but that's not enough. Nothing is enough for anyone nowadays...... it sucks
