Depression sucks... and trying to rebound from it sucks almost as much. especially when your depression self destructiveness led to permanent damage. its hard to work your way out of hopelessness when your teeth constantly hurt from the multitude of cavities that formed after weeks of not brushing. but everyday gets a little better, and sometimes its hard to remind yourself of that. cheers to trying to form a solid flossing habit :)
