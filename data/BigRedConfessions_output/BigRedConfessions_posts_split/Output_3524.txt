I never like going out with my friend because she's 1000x more beautiful than I am and I know when we go out all the guys are going to flock to her and pretend like I don't exist. I love her she's my best friend but she wants to go out with me and I'm running out of excuses for getting out of it. I don't know what to do anymore I can't tell her because she'll stop being my friend. What should I do? Keep making excuses?
