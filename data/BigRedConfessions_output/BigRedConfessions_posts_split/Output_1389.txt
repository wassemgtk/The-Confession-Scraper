I grew up known as “boy crazy”. My first crush was in pre-k 3 on a cute blonde boy. I was the girl who was always, at any given moment, crushing on some guy. My room was always decorated with posters of attractive celebrity males. Once I cried over the beauty of Harry styles. Throughout high school I was really into this one guy for two and a half years and I still get a bit nervous when I occasionally see him. I was the least person you’d expect for this to happen to. 

At the beginning of my senior year, I met this girl and she completely changed my entire life. She was very gay, and I thought she had a crush on me – she would give little hints and act a certain way with me. It didn’t really phase me and I continued to be friendly with her and got to know her very well since we were on a traveling team together. We spent a lot of time together and she soon became one of my best friends. She wasn't obvious about her crush on me anymore, and she told me recently it was because I looked and acted "completely straight" and she believed it was pointless to crush on someone like that. At the time I thought I was all wrong about the crush and it was just me being cocky. Anyway, we got really close and I considered her my best friend. However, slowly, I began to feel something more, something different. Without realizing it, I began liking her as more than a friend. It was like a snowball rolling down a hill of snow - starting small and slow and getting bigger and faster exponentially. I denied it and denied it until I couldn't anymore. 

One day, in the car with her after a tournament, I looked over at her. She was looking out the window. She looked so damn beautiful and I took her hand and held it. She didn't move, (our team was all Latina and very touchy – we all would always cuddle in the car after tournaments and hold hands) She must have thought I was just being the usually touchy teammate and best friend. But for me, holding her hand this time was different. I’m embarrassed to say but I literally started tearing up. Half of it was because I was overwhelmed by this feeling for her. The other half was me saying “Well, fuck. I like her. She’s a girl. A fucking girl. How is this possible?!” I finally admitted to myself I liked this girl and that’s how it all began. For the next sleep away tournament we were roommates and had to share a bed. We cuddled every night. We were in a very beautiful place with beaches and pools and activities but every single second we had free without games, I just wanted to spend with her. 

During that trip I made it blatantly obvious to her that I was interested in her. She pretty much made it seem mutual. Even other teammates noticed. Three days after we came back, she told me she liked me. I told her that I liked her as well, and from there a long series of events happened including our first kiss, the day we started dating, family drama and way too much more that would turn this long essay into a novel. Well, we’ve been dating for about 7 and I am very happy with her. She treats me like a princess and I just want to make her happy. I love and care for her very much. She is completely open about us, her parents know and accept it and love me very much. My side is different. My dad doesn’t know. My mom found out and flipped out. She’s still not okay with it but she tolerates it kind of. My sister’s humiliated about it. 

Anyway, my problem is this – I want to tell the entire world about my girlfriend and show her off and post every picture. The thing is, I’m scared to be labeled “gay” because I really don’t think I am. Obviously, I’m a little crooked. I’m with a girl, for goodness sake. It’s only her though. For now, at least. She’s the only girl I have ever felt attracted to, mentally, physically, and sexually. I feel like if everyone here knows I am with a girl, they will automatically assume I am gay, and honestly I am not ready for that label and I doubt I ever will be. I don’t know what to do.

I know the usual advice – don’t care what people think, don’t label yourself or let other people label you, just do what makes you happy, etc. It’s not that easy. I don’t know anything and I am still confused about how I feel this way. A little over a year ago, if you told me I would like a girl, I would have laughed in your face. But it happened and there’s no going back. Is it possible to be straight with one exception? I don’t know. All I know is I love this chick in an extremely stronger and different way than any platonic friendship should be.
