I just got out of an emotionally abusive relationship. It took me a while to accept it for what it is, because I never expected the person I loved so much to be the person hurting me the most.

I always thought I'd be smart enough to stop it before it got too far. But before I knew it I was manipulated and internalizing everything he said. I lost confidence and started evaluating everything I did based on how he would feel about it. I let him isolate me from the friends that he felt threatened by. I did everything he said, because he's the person who cared about me the most right?

I realized far too late that that's not love. Love isn't trying to change someone, it's not trying to get them to see the world your way. It's accepting someone for their flaws, not belittling them for their insecurities.

I wish I had seen it sooner. It's hard knowing everyone around you sees it but you. But the worst part by far is being so attached and altered that I keep wanting to go back. Because he's changed the way I think. I feel like I need him, I'm dependent on him. Because he only wanted the best for me right? I can't shake the conditioning of the past year that tells me every problem we had was all my fault.

It may take me a few months to fully detach myself, but at least I can see it for what it really was. The urge to keep going back will be hard to suppress, but it will go away. Emotional abuse is real. It doesn't leave scars, but it changes you forever. I wish I didn't have to learn that the hard way.
