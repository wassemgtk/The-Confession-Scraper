I hate my rich white friends.  I'm a low class white dude and I will have to grind everyday of my life to have much of anything.  I get excited about just eating out. I may not face the discrimination my non-white friends do but I hate being associated with them just because of the color of my skin.  Don't hate races, hate those rich fucks that don't share with any of us :(
