I think I found "the one." She's everything that I could have asked for. She's kind, caring, and forgiving. She's strong, intelligent, and independent. She has a heart of gold. She's helped me through so much, and has helped me become a better person. The time that's passed since we started dating have been the best in my life. I can't imagine my life without her now. I know she feels the same way towards me, and I can only hope that I can continue to prove that I'm worthy of her love.
