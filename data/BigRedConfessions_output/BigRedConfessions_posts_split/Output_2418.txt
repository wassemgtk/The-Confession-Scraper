I'm so miserable here and I treat everyone like shit. I hate myself for doing it but I just can't help it sometimes. I hate everything about this place and it brings out the worst in me. I even treat my friends like shit, I associate them with this place and even though they aren't the greatest friends, they don't deserve to be treated like this. I can't wait for the day I can leave everything associated with Cornell behind.
