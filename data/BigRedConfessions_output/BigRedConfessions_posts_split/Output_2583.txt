Apparently I only became friends with her to piss you off. No. Get off your high horse, not everything is about you. I became friends with her because I am not stuck in high school and actually care more than just my "clique" and how cool I am perceived to be. Maybe if you stopped caring so much and being so insecure you would realize how many friends you have lost that used to really care about you.
