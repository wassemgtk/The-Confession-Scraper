I cant sleep at night thinking and debating whether grad school will be harder than undergrad. I already went on a health leave and dont want to do it in grad school. should i just go to another university for grad school or just try it out in Cornell ? ughh idk what to dooo anymore. i feel like going to UC davis for grad school cuz it seems cool but then im curious about the program cornell has too. im ripped in two right now.
