My summers in at least the past 5 years have been truly lonely and void of any type of fun and I hate it. I just had to turn down a summer program that lasts half the summer and pays for everything because it does not pay me, and I need to save money for school next year. Considering college summer breaks are a month longer than high school summer breaks, this summer is going to be even worse and I am going to be miserable.
