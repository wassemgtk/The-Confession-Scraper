Is it terrible I always feel like I'll never amount to anything because my body can't keep up with the stress and burdens of long work hours? The moment I start to skip meals or sleep to keep up is the moment my body starts to crash. I was told that I honestly needed to rest for a few days and that is all it took to fall so far behind. I suppose it's just another one of those survival of the fittest things and I'm just lucky to be alive. I really envy the people who can wake up and work almost constantly. I hate being punished for my stupid failing body that won't listen to my willpower and ambitions. This semester was my final warning too.
