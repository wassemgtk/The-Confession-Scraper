I'm a 21 year old male and I'm balding. You can't really tell unless I'm under some bright fluorescent light--in which case it is noticeable since you can begin to see my scalp from the top. I plan on shaving it the instant it becomes too noticeable. I know many of you will say it's about the confidence factor in men that makes them attractive. But honest question, if there are two identical twins but one is completely bald and the other is a regular looking guy with no signs of balding, and they're both equally matched in confidence, personality, etc. which would you prefer? It's questions like these that make me consider buying a really good wig. I mean if women can get boob implants, why can't I get a wig?
