My dad's Indian and my mom's Chinese. I'm really scared about what's going to happen to my family if India and China decide to go to war (border tensions have surged recently). Both my parents are 2nd generation immigrants and are pretty much completely assimilated in America. But if the two nations go to war, I'm scared they'll get divorced and that I'll have to meiotically split into my Indian self and my Chinese self. I DONT WANT MY FAMILY TO SPLIT UP.
