You know, I get if you don't want to hang out and be friends after we had a thing. I get it if it's awkward for you or something. But I'd much rather you tell me that so I can get over you instead of you telling me you want to be friends then cancel our plans and completely ignore me and my texts after that. It makes you seem like a dick.
