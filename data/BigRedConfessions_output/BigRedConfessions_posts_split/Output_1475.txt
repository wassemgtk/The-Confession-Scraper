Thank you to the staff of Cornell Confessions for volunteering your time and giving people a tribune to share their troubles. It made me feel better the times when my confessions were posted and I felt the support of fellow Cornellians. This page reminds me of the inscription on the bench behind the clock tower that reads: "To those who shall sit here rejoicing. To those who sit here mourning. Sympathy and greeting. So we have done in our time".
