There's this guy - no, there was this guy. We became pretty close despite all of my warning bells going off; he had liked me in the past but I thought 'it's been a while, I'm sure he's over me by now!' Anyways, we became really close, talking a lot, texting a lot, going out a lot. All of my friends told me that he liked me but I chose not to believe them because for once in my life, I wanted to have a guy friend who didn't end up wanting to be more than friends. Well, all my plans were blown to hell because he told me he liked me and I didn't know what to do. I'm broken, you see, I hadn't really had non-platonic feelings towards anyone since my last relationship. I hung on to memories and could-have-beens and though I'm slowly healing, at that time, I couldn't give my friend what he wanted; I couldn't tell him I liked him back. After a while, our texting became less regular - my fault really, I became insanely busy - and he took it to be that I couldn't handle being his friend after he confessed his feelings. At some point, he just stopped texting; I guess he had had enough of me. Now, we're reduced to glancing at each other when we think the other isn't looking; avoiding each other whenever we can. I wish I could go back to the beginning. I wish I could somehow find a way to not end up this way. 
This semester I learned a lot about myself. I finally made a guy friend and it's completely platonic on both sides. He brings so many positive things to my life. I also went on a couple dates with a really great guy, found that I could feel again. I don't want to go back in time and go out with the guy from my past, I wasn't ready then. I just wish that we had become close now, when I'm ready to feel again. I wish I didn't hurt him, I wish he didn't hurt me. I wish we could still laugh together over our caffeine addictions. Everything's changed now, we can't go back to what we were; there's too much history between us. Still, some day, I hope we can bump into each other and have a nice conversation instead of sidelong glances and pretending not to see the other.
