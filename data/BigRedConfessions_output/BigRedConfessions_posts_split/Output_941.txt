I never understood why people go to the library rather than studying at home. I mean... why? It's not like you're actually using the library. Today's university libraries are little more than Starbucks with internet, no one is actually reading the books, they are just using the workspace and internet. Well you probably have a desk with internet in your apartment/room. So why go to the library? Why be confined by a narrow space and social norms when you can eat, talk to yourself, be dressed however you like, and be as comfortable as you like in your own home while studying, surrounded by your things? To me studying is a personal thing. I absolutely don't understand why the vast majority of people go to "libraries" to do it. I tried it. I do much better at home.
