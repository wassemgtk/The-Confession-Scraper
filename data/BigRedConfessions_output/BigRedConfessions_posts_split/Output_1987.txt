On July 13th. I passed a guy on the trail behind Mann Library at around 4:45pm, I should have stopped to talk to you. I saw you standing on the side of the path and you looked like you were going through something rough. It looked like you were praying, or maybe just taking some time to think, but I wanted to stop and ask if you were alright. I didn't, and I regret it. I know what it's like to just want to get away from the world, and I would have wanted someone to stop for me. I was the guy with the orange backpack, and I was hating myself for the rest of my walk home for not saying anything. If I see you there again, I won't make the same mistake twice.
