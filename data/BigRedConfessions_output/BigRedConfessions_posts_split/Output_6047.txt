I have begun to have second thoughts about you even though you claim it's "not like that".

How do you think it feels being dragged around and yet not given my place by your side because you're too afraid of what others think or could possibly do to our relationship or whatever it is that's going on between us? I'd like to know.
In this fear you resort to spending less and less time with me and more and more weekends kissing ass to and going out with your million and one friends, and not to mention, getting drunk and high. 
The few times we have gone out you don't even introduce me to your friends, but you sure wear me on your arm like a brand spanking new watch or something. 

Wow, I feel so stupid. (Feel free to agree)
You expect me to take care of your drunk self tonight? Most likely not this time, buddy.
I've got better things to do-on that "future" agenda you dread so much. 
And you have to nerve to ask me why she thought you were an asshole?
There you go. There's your answer.

I hope you take all the things you've told me and shove them up your ass. They're all just a confused menagerie.... 

In the meantime I'll do all the things I've missed out on doing with my best friends for the past few months.  Having the time of my life, dressing up, being sexy like I want to be.

Don't get me wrong, I thought you were really sweet.
Come back to me when you're ready to FACE REALITY HEAD ON, and leave the past in the past.
Don't take too long though, time isn't working in your favor.
