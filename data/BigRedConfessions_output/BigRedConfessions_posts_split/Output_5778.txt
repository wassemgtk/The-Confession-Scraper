"I picked a huge fight with my best friend because I feel like she doesn't support me. So after I blew up on her (which was me totally blowing it out of proportion) I deleted a chat app that we use to talk, and now all I want to do is apologize and talk to her but I can't bring myself to do it. I saw her leaving her building today and we both awkwardly and sadly waved, guess I ruined another friendship because of my emotional out bursts. :/
 Sorry G"
