I secretly believe in witchcraft. I'm a science major so none of my friends would never take me seriously for saying this, but I honest to god believe that there are witches/wizards at Ithaca College who incur the wrath of the weather gods and summon the winds and clouds and thunder gods' intestines to shit on us.
