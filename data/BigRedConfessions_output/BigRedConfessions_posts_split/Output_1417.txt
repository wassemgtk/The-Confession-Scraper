Even though I don't agree with Fox News, I think the university's response was exaggerated. They should have been allowed to interview students because students are adults and can consent as to whether or not they would like to be interviewed. I would defend to my death, anybody's right to speak out and say what they believe in even if I do not agree with them. After all that is a right granted to us in the Constitution under the 1st amendment, which protects offensive speech. You do not need to protect nice, flowery language ever. Ours was the first revolution in the history of the world that changed the course of government under the three words: WE THE PEOPLE. We the people of the United States have rights and that includes our 1st amendment right to disagree with others and say what we want but WE WILL NOT BE SILENCED DAMMIT! I am embarrassed to go to Cornell, which was founded as a land grant college and as the "First American University." Yeah Ezra, a Republican, must be rolling in his grave as basic American values are violated especially how the new president wants to regulate speech. My ass that will ever happen and I will sue the university since it does get state and federal money to operate under financial aid programs, DARPA and research grants, and to operate the statutory colleges of NY. Don't you dare limit my free speech. Skorton was so much better, even though he had extremely liberal views, he was open towards freedom of speech and academic freedom, as well as a fiscal conservative who grew up from humble beginnings as an immigrants' son. Lets not go farther than that were we currently are standing. I wish he was back again. I will really miss him even though we differed on a lot of opinions. :(
