Today (Saturday) I was studying on floor 3B (3rd basement down) in Uris Library. I really had to pee but didn't feel like going all the way up to the first floor where the private bathrooms are. Also, sometimes the private bathrooms are both occupied. Since there was no one else on this floor, I just peed in one of the garbage cans.
