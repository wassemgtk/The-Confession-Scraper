"So I've been having this conversation with a lot of friends about dating and serious relationships with girls at Cornell. It seems like so many guys are looking for a woman to cook their meals and raise their kids, and there's this perpetual complaint that the girls here are too driven. !!!!!

I find this totally baffling. I find feminist women extremely attractive. I love that they won't stand for the status quo, and that they are willing to battle for what they deserve. Idk, maybe I'm overreacting, but I think it's completely insane that some guys who were smart enough to get into a school like this dream of going home to a person whose only function is to serve them. I'm looking forward to finding a person that inspires me with her incredible ambition and awesome personality, that calls me on my shit and allows me to call her on hers. 

I just really hope I'm not the only guy who feels this way. You gals are amazing, and I hope its appreciated."
