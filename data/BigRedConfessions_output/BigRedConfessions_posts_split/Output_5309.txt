Is diversity only about admission stats and percentage? I started asking this when in freshman year my roommate said that he hoped to switch and had a white roommate. Now I believe even more so after spending 2 years here, especially when I'm at CollegeTown Saturday nights. I find correlation between greek life and diversity so awkward. Fortunately I recently start finding some true diversity among people in my major.
