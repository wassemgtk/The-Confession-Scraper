I'm a pre-frosh, and...I don't want to say too much but I just feel lost and unsure. It was my dream to come to Cornell, but recently, tuition stress and others putting me down has made my passion for this school fade. It scares me now that I'm questioning whether I made the right decision to come here. It's not that there's a school I'd rather go to other than Cornell, but I wish I could feel excited again. Current students, please tell me...what makes Cornell right for you?
