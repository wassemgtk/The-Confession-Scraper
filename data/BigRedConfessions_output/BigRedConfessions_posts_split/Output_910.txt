You don't strike me at all as someone who doesn't care about your life. It sounds like you're just trying to figure out who you are and where you belong. Walks and discrete mixes help a lot with figuring that out. My advise, for what it's worth - if you find engineering interesting, keep at it. Make a career out of doing something good for the world with it. Take art as a minor. In 10 or whatever years, if you want to make art or something else your thing, you'll have the money from engineering to make a smooth transition. You may not care about money now, but once you have to start paying rent and electric and buying food and insurance and then your car needs repaired and your dog needs surgery, you'll be glad you have the financial ability to do so. Just stay away from debt. Ok that's it. Keeping being good to yourself. I think you'll be just fine.
