I graduated Cornell over a year ago and got a top job in my field, living the "life" in NYC.  I'm walking away from it all though by the end of the year.  All your networking, 4.0 GPA's, and carefully perfected resumes you've worked for won't necessarily bring you true happiness.  Then again, don't take my word for it.  Go live for yourself, and you'll find your own answers.
