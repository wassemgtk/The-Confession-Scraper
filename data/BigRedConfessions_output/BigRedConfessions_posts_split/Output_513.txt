Lately I have been so lonely and have so many problems that I sniff paint thinner I get from Lowe's in small amounts. It is less deleterious on my body that drinking alcohol and it helps me feel better and calm down. I've tried linseed oil and WD-40 with mixed results too. One of my friends was wondering and questioned me about my two cans of paint thinner, WD-40, and linseed oil in my apartment, and I told them that I just use these solvents to clean my art brushes after I finish painting for my class projects. It's not a lie that I use paint thinner to clean my paintbrushes, but it does help get me pretty high when I feel low like I have been for a few months now. The feeling is just so great that's it is irresistible to not sniff because I am stuck in an abyss of loneliness, stress, and endless studio projects that I would otherwise just want to disappear from existence. My art projects have been suffering lately because I have hit a mental block and don't see passion in what I am doing anymore.
