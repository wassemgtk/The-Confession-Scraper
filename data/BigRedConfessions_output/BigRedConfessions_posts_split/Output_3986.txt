My apologies if it seems like I'm ignoring you.  Like I said: I'm shy.  And since I first saw you this semester, I've been shy and embarrassed.  So it goes.  But, hell, even though I don't think it matters after this much time, that little story deserved a better ending than confused silence.  Now you know.
