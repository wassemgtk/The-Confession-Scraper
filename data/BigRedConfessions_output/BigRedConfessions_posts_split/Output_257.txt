There is a student organization on campus which discriminates people based on race. The members were originally in another group and formed their own group because they didn't want to dance with people of a different race, or even those from different country. They keep their organization "pure" by having an 'audition', which they don't even advertise it to anyone of a different color/background from them. Seriously wtf?
