I refuse to take feminism seriously until they start fighting to sign up for selective service and admit that women tend to get less jail time for the use [same?] crimes as men

[OA: Yo, within the past two years the military's barely starting to allow women in more active combat roles; and no one's denying that women on average get less jail time for the same crimes as men. As Far As I Know, feminists are not trying to circumvent "negative" aspects of equality, and your examples of different treatment are examples of how women are viewed as lesser persons within themselves.]
