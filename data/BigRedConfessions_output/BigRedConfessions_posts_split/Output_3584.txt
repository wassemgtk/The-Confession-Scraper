I don't want to date at Cornell. I'm a guy who's still in love with my female best friend (of 8+ years) from high school that I'm in constant contact with and always see over breaks. Why just date someone, tell them everything about you, and then have the dump you in a matter of months? 

And to that best friend: we are close to being on the same page. We openly say how we worry for each other when we're apart, and how neither of us have found someone who can do the things we have (already) for each other. We understand each other in ways that no one else does. We're each other's other halves, and you're on the brink of realizing it, too.
