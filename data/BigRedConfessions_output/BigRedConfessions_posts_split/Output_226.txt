Just my story, skip on ahead if you don't like to see posts about mental health issues. Cornell is to put it simply an amazing school with awesome opportunities and great people, but it was not the right time for me to be there.  I dealt with depression and anxiety for most of my time there and it was hard having to balance school work, home problems, and a social life all while being constantly depressed and anxious. For a long time I refused to see how sick I really was, I always believed that the next semester would be better, that I would get through it, that it wasn't a big deal if I didn't do this one assignment.  I didn't want to be the depressed kid I didn't want any of my friends or family to know that I was struggling. I was afraid.  I ended up failing more than half of my classes and I knew that I had to do something, so I went to Gannett.  Gannett has helped lots of people I know that, but in my case I feel that they didn't do enough for me. My therapist I guess tried to make me feel better but it always backfired because they always made me feel like shit about being a bad student. The therapist's priority was that I be a good student (how can we get you to go to class this week mentality), when for me at the time I was just trying to keep it together as a person.  The only good thing this therapist did for me was to suggest that I take a health leave. To any of you struggling I am sure you have heard this from one of your advisors or doctors, and if you are anything like me you were probably crushed.  A leave?  I felt like a disappointment, a failure, I had so much guilt because I would have to leave. My family worked so hard, hell I worked so hard to get here just for my stupid depression to destroy everything. Thats how it felt at the time.  Telling my family was hard, telling my friends I was taking a year off was hard, but it was the best thing I ever did for myself.  I couldn't see it at the time but I needed help.  I've been away from Cornell for almost a year now and honestly its been great because I've gained a lot of perspective and most importantly I have been getting better. Seeing a new therapist who has no connection to Cornell is amazing because they don't judge me, and they are treating me as a person not a student.  I can honestly say that I am much happier now and although I don't know when I will be going back to Cornell, I know that I will go back eventually and I will be in a much better place. So I guess what I'm trying to say is that if you are struggling academically or mentally at Cornell, don't give up on yourself.  Tell your friends about what is going on, they love you and will help you. Seek help, whatever that may be whether its Gannett or a doctor elsewhere, or even tutoring.  Lots of people struggle here but we are always afraid of being judged and so we hide our troubles, but that just hurts us more in the long run.   Don't be afraid to take a leave, it will be hard emotionally, but it will be for the better.  I definitely wish there was a bigger support network for people struggling academically due to health issues on campus.  And I definitely wish someone had told me that it was ok if my life plan didn't go as I wanted it to go. Oh and remember that you are more than your transcripts and that you are more than your mental illness, you are worthy and you are lovable.
