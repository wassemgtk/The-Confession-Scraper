"So I've seen posts about the good old days at Cornell and how it's not nearly as good anymore. What good old days? I would say there's positive change in some respects. For instance, Cornell engineering's class of 2019 is 48% women--a statistic that the ""good old days"" couldn't even remotely achieve. Sure, there were a few women engineers here, but 48%? So our ""radical feminists"" are proud of our near equal opportunity here. Personally, I think both the men and women here are happy with it.

I think some bigger issues today would be tuition costs and social equality. Not ""radical feminists"" or ""women choosing to be sexualized."""
