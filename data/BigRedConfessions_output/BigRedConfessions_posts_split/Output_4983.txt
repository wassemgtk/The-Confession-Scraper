Today I woke up and realized that I really dislike and am annoyed by my best friend. I haven't spoken to her in a few days since she's out of the country so she hasn't done anything to cause this so I'm extremely confused. Yesterday I was just thinking about how grateful and lucky I am to have such an amazing friend like her but this morning for some reason I became super annoyed by her being. Things that she does that I used to not even pay attention to suddenly came to mind and made me become pissed off at her. Her entire existence just annoyed me. What the hell is going on in my head?

Has anyone else had this happen
