Hey, douchebag wearing the "Thai Wrestling" sweatshirt on the first floor of Olin at 1:45 AM. Just because it's 1:45 AM does not mean this isn't a library anymore. Your ****ing laughing, talking out loud with your friend whom you're trying to hit on in the douchiest way possible, coughing like crazy, not even trying to make an effort to be quiet, in fact seemingly making every effort to be as loud as possible, is annoying beyond what words can describe. I am so tempted to get up and punch you in the stupid face. I hope your cough kills you.
