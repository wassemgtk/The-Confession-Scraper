In response to #3257:

I just came out to all of my friends this year, but I'm nonetheless facing a similar problem of going back into the closet for next year. I'm seriously considering rushing, and I'm kind of nervous that frats will see my sexuality and won't even try to get to know more about me as a person.

I've also definitely had my share of using alcohol as an escape, and I was pretty much a functional alcoholic for most of this year.

THAT being said, you need to learn how to love yourself for who you are. Confronting everything that you've been repressing for so long is always uncomfortable and emotional, but the benefits of being able to live openly and freely far outweighs the difficulty of being honest with yourself. And remember, sexuality doesn't define all of who you are. That person who you've spent all of your life becoming is still authentic; you're just unveiling a new additional part of yourself that you had previously kept hidden.
