I find Cornell so greedy: They hold a giving day that raises $7 million, and yet, a large proportion of the studrnt body continuously struggles to make ends meet. Honestly, why can't Cornell specify where that monry will be going more so than state that donors "choose?" (If you're wondering what I'm referring to, see this link: https://givingday.cornell.edu/about/) For all I know, it can be going into a professor's big fat paycheck, just to cover the cost of hiring a new faculttmember that the school doesn't necessarily need.
