So transitioning to Cornell has been very hard and I still can't say that I feel like I fit in. I have had trouble with my classes and have had suicidal thoughts & depressive feelings on top of finding it hard to make friends. I feel like I'm now only happy when I'm drunk, at a party, hooking up with someone or when someone shows some kind of interest in me... :| ... I won't give up though...
 here's to a hopefully good end of the semester and a better school year next year for us all!
