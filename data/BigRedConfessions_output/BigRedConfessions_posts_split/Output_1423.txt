I spend last year at Cornell and then was forced to leave Cornell by my parents two days before this semester began. There's not at day that goes by that I don't feel like my heart is breaking. My parents didn't let me return because they didn't believe that I deserved it. They make a lot of money, and just bought themselves a second house the same price as another three years at Cornell. The worst part is, I can't pay for the state school I'll be going to in two semesters on my own despite working full time until then, so I have to smile and pretend to be happy for them so they'll still help me with the cheapest college I could get into.
