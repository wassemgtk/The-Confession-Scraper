On Tuesday, I had an absolutely wonderful conversation with a girl during an almost cinematic scene on this resplendent, infinitely spontaneous, aesthetically delirious, and vibrantly alive campus. On Wednesday, I had another one with a different girl in an equally beautiful setting. And these are just the icing on the cake. In general, I've been doing so much better with interactions, recognizing a good friendship that shouldn't be corrupted, challenging my own previous notions about romance, etc. 

Now then: I would love to stay in this world of change, good friendship, and sanity for as long as I can. I am SO glad with where I am right now. They always tell you cliches about college changing you. But my goodness, have I changed, and in so many ways. These conversations could never have happened without all of my learning moments from the past. I NEEDED to go through all of that and I couldn't possibly know where I'd be or what I'd be as an almost 21 year old without all of those frighteningly awkward and absurd mistakes from my 16-20 year old past (though really, you could go much farther back if you wanted to, but I digress.) So for that I am grateful.

 Still, I am an extremely sexual and highly romantic being at my core, and while I don't currently feel that I'm suppressing anything, I know that I'm liable to ruin one or more of these interactions soon. And even though I'm more confident and I make much better decisions now, I am afraid of dealing with the possibility of my past, oft-rejected self by making a move on one of these many great friends I have. I'm not afraid of rejection, just wary of my own imperfection, if that makes any sense. Some of these friends are quite literally VICTIMS of my poor decision-making that have come back over time, and our friendships have rekindled magically. 

I don't want to fail and slip back into my old ways or rely on terrible things like porn and fetishization and desperate social media endeavors/ill-advised, random, romantic ventures as a filthy, foolish, and angry/sad backlash to my feelings of inevitable failure. Please don't tell me to just be brave and reach out to one of the people I'm interested in--I'm still in the process of learning how to actually read signs and I don't want to rush anything.  But I also don't want to get bored and do something stupid.
