We have such great conversations in person, which is probably the more important part. But when you respond to questions over text, it hurts. I wish electronic communication wasn't so important, because it's objectively sort of pointless, but we live in an age where it's a big deal. It makes me wonder what will happen when we can't see each other in person over the summer. Will you just disappear?
