As a Hispanic,
I believe that its ok for people to celebrate St. Paddy's day, 5 de mayo, #nationalpuppyday, Chinese New Year, Thanksgiving, or anything you want to celebrate. I think the fact that we're in America should allow us to be a part of all of these, learn about them, and have fun. Why have a titty attack if we all celebrate Halloween and we're not celebrating hallow's eve or Valentine's day when it is supposed to be St. Valentine's feast day. 

One thing is blatantly being rude or disrespectful towards a culture and another is sucking the fun out of everything.
