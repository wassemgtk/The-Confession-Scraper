I feel such a huge amount of hopelessness right now. My friends are getting internship offers and interviews left and right, and yet here I am, having just gotten rejected after interviewing for a company I really wanted to work at this coming summer. I can't wait to graduate and leave Cornell (love my friends here, but I'm just ready to leave), but at this rate, I'm afraid that I won't have a job to support myself when it actually comes time to leave. The workload from my classes are eating me up, and I feel that this is going to be one of my first semesters at this university. I'm just so disappointed with myself.
