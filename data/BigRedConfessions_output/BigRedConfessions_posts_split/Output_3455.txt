I've had so much anxiety lately and I have no clue what to do about it. I can't fall asleep for several hours every night and I spend most of my waking time worrying about prelims and being scared that I will fail my classes and get kicked out of Cornell. I think I'm anxious to the point where it really hurts me, and it wouldn't surprise me if I actually do really badly in school just because I spend so much time worrying instead of studying. I also can't seem to concentrate on my work at all. I have no idea what to do about this, I've been to CAPS before and they were not very helpful, but rather mean to me. I would never want to go back to Gannett again. And I have looked around at therapists and psychiatrists in Ithaca but it seems hopeless to find someone good. Family and Children Services turned me down and so have other therapists I've talked to in Ithaca because they said that they didn't think they would be able to help me. I feel like I have nowhere to turn to and I don't know how I'll be able to get through this semester without some supportâ€¦ :(
