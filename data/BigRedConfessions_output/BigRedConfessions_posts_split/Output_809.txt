My sense of self worth is so messed up right now. After putting my all in for people who seemed to not hate my face only to be ignored or rejected I just don't want to keep trying. Now when I try seeing other people I overthink every single thing: they saw my message but ignored me? They suck fuck them. They made a snide remark that under non-romantic circumstances I would've laughed at? Fuck them they hate you you don't need them! I noticed a small bit of hesitation in their laughing at my joke? Obviously they don't want to be around you, forget about them entirely -- pretend they don't exist.
