I'm slightly crazy, I've decided. I love too quickly, I anger too harshly, I cry too heavily, and I do not fear enough. In fact,  I've built this wall, it protects me from harsh glances and under-the-breath curses of cowards. But, it also isolates me from the one I want the most. It isolates me from what I've been craving all this time: passion. I've reached a point where security means nothing, if it stands in the way of my happiness.
