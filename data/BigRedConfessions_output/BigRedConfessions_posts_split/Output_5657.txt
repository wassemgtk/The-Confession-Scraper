So... inspired by the "complete rando someone grinded with on the slope" I realized that I almost did the same. Except that we had actually met that morning. To be honest, I wanted to do more than just grind with you and get one kiss. Not anything serious. I realize you're leaving for way better things but, I'm fairly certain you remember my name so maybe message me?
