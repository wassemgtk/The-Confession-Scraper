Don't give up. Try talking to her. Even if this semester is almost over there's always next semester. And if this is your last semester here I would still go for it if you feel she's special. I'm telling you this but really I should be taking my own advise. There's this guy that I like and the truth is he's probably going to leave without ever knowing how I feel about him because I'm too shy and too afraid to say anything to him. So be brave. Don't be like me.
