"One morning before Fall Break I was in a rush (as usual), and grabbed any pair of shorts I could find for my rock climbing class. When I got to the class, I saw that these black shorts had a few small white stains on the back. This was obviously semen. I knew I could defend myself and claim it was toothpaste or bird poop, but let's face it, everyone would think it's semen. 

My frustration levels were at an all time high when I realized most of the climbers in my class rub chalk on their hands to avoid sweaty hands. So I simply rubbed a lot of chalk on the back of my shorts to camouflage the semen. As I reviewed my success with this debacle, I was like, damn, I go to Cornell motherfucker. "
