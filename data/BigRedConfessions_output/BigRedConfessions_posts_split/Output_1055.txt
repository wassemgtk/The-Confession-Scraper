I’m a non-Asian who has been a member of an Asian cultural/performance club on campus for a while, so I’m used to sticking out. I can’t easily identify with all the cultural things/references/jokes/influences, but I’ve tried my best to adapt and learn. That being said, I’ve always had a feeling that I didn’t really belong with the group, or shouldn’t be a part of it.

While with the club, I’ve never been discriminated against (at least, not to my face,) and this feeling is not due to the attitudes other members express towards me. They’ve been accepting and I’ve made a majority of my Cornellian friends through them. Still, it just feels weird to be at events with crowds of people who probably would never have expected to see someone like me. It feels even weirder now that I’m in an elected position in the group. I often imagine it’s like seeing an iguana running with a pack of 20+ dogs, not away from them. 

Perhaps it’s just a backwards way of thinking that’s been created from living in a heavily stratified area prior to coming to Cornell, but I secretly believe that I hurt the image of the club by not being, well… Asian. I really care about this club, but now that’s led to me wondering if being a part of it is actually bad for it. Do people judge the club differently because I’m a part of it?

It’s made me question my role a lot, and I’ve never really shared this view with the other members. I feel like they would support me (I hope they would), but in doing so, brush off my concerns as ones that aren’t really valid. After all, they’ve accepted me, why wouldn’t everyone else? I wouldn’t want to get into a dispute about how they aren’t representative of everyone else in their views. I feel like that would just be bad for team spirit. 

If I could go back to freshman year, knowing what I know now, I probably would have still joined the club to learn all that I have learned and make the friends that I have made, but I probably wouldn’t have gotten so involved. I feel like it may have been better this way, for establishing group identity and strengthening group image, to have that random guy off to the side, seen occasionally, but never really heard.  

While my claims may be unwarranted, and may seem like intuition gone wrong, I still feel like I’ll have to deal with them until I graduate and can put this all behind me (which sucks, seeing how the club has a pretty strong alumni network, with past members visiting quite often given their busy schedules…). At that time, at least, I’ll have no real role in the club, and no real effect on anything.

To be clear, I haven’t been discriminated against while here at Cornell. I just feel like I either should have been, hearing all of the campus stories and current events in this country, or have already been discriminated against, just not to my face. The latter option is what scares me the most.
