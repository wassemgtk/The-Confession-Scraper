Cornell has given me nearly everything:

A nearly fully funded world class education

Professors, the leaders in their field doing their best to make sure I know everything I need to. 

A career services office promising me a position somewhere among the world's elite. 

But yet Cornell can't give me a true friend. or any friends. or the knowledge of how to make friends and not completely alienate all of the people you ever meet.
