"My major is one people love to make fun of, and I party frequently. My conversations are mostly shopping, books, life, the other person, etc.,. If I talk about class, it's if I did laughably bad on something. Most of my friends and acquaintances look down on me as a crazy, fun party girl. Truth is, I make Dean's list every semester (with harder classes outside of my major and a better GPA than my friends), get kick ass internships, and  spend my free time teaching myself coursework so I can take more advanced classes.

Freshmen: Don't judge people by their majors and finish your homework in time for happy hour.
