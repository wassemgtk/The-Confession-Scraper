My girlfriend makes me feel insecure occasionally. She's so much more popular and everyone likes her while I only have a couple close friends. She's really smart and I'm a mediocre student. She's involved in a bunch of stuff and has leadership positions while I just bum around and do nothing. She's nice and considerate to everyone and I feel like I'm sometimes a dick without even realizing it. Once we graduate, she'll work in the same position as me but at a marginally more prestigious firm. I guess none of this really matters since we've been with each other for awhile and get along very well, but I still feel like I'm punching above my weight sometimes.
