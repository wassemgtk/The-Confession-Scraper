You may have seen me tonight. I was that short girl with the glasses walking all around campus and Collegetown by myself... Or you may have not seen me. Whatever the case, I walk around with a purpose. That purpose is the hope that someday something bad to happen to me, for someone to strip away the life that I am too much of a coward to take away myself.
