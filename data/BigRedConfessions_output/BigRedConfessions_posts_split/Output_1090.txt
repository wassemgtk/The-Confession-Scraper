When you go to see your professor during office hours to answer questions and get advice and what not, and you're hoping that the conversation will lead to this wonderful mentoring relationship but then a point comes in the meeting where the professor is clearly ready to get you out of their office. When half of your friends just want to party and the other half spends all their time with their lovers. When you feel like you've spoken only about 500 words this week and half of those were "Hi, how are you? I'm good thanks. See you later." When you have offer your friendship to someone you thought you were hitting it off with only to be rejected again and again in the subtlest of ways. When you're just exhausted and ready to go home and curl up with Spot and Fluffy and really just Netflix and chill and eat good homemade food and actually get some decent sleep.
