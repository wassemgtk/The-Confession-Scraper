When I go back to Cornell I'd like to become an engineer (mechanical preferably). I'm a Bio major now and I suck at math (D in Calc I my freshman year). Should I just give up? Is it possible for me to become better at math? I'm asking here bc I have no one else to talk to about this. Even my mom laughs at my dream. :(
