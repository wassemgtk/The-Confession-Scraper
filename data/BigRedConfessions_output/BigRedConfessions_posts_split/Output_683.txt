All I've ever wanted to do is become a software engineer. Programming is so much fun for me and I love the problem solving involved with the whole process.

And this past semester I got a C+ in CS 2110, the "easiest course in CS" according to my TAs and peers. I'm still taking CS 3110 next semester but I'm already so concerned that I'll bomb it and end up having to change to a different major.

I'm not sure if my thinking is outrageous or if Cornell just wants me to feel inadequate at this point.
