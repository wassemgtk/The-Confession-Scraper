I gave you all these years, I gave you everything that I had, and even what I didn't have. And you dare ask me to man up when I feel like shit because of you? Just because you can use a person for so long (and it was a freaking long time) and just throw them away means everyone can do it and freaking take it. That was uncalled for and harsh. And you dare blame me for all of it. You knew your 'arguments' were only excuses. You are too proud to admit that you were wrong and now you're trying to push everything on me? Are you for real? I can't believe how much I loved you. I can't believe how much you've changed. You've become the exact same thing you despised so much. Honestly, how do you live with yourself?
