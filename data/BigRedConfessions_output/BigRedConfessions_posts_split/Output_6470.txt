Would anybody mind if I started sitting with people who are eating alone at dining halls (unless they have headphones in or are studying etc.)? Not out of pity. I eat almost every meal alone and have done so for the past three years here. It would be awesome to meet new people and have someone to talk to, even if it's just smalltalk for a short period of time.
