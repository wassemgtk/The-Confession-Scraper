OP of #6748 thanks for speaking up because I also dislike people who are so fucking environmentally conscious, and have to tell me how to live my life. I hated living in NY for that reason and I am so glad I live in Pennsylvania now. There is less influence from environmentalists and as a result things are more reliable, especially my electricity which is 50% cheaper than upstate NY. I don't have to waste time recycling everything to be in compliance with the law because my town does not even have curbside recycle that's mandatory. I get to pay less fuel taxes in Pennsylvania as well and don't have to worry much about environmental horse shit unless I'm in Philly maybe
