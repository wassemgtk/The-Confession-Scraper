There's a difference between being selfless and not caring at all about yourself. I think you think you're a really good person-- you martyr yourself a ton-- but you're also incredibly spiteful, stubborn, and toxic. I'm pretty sure I won't be talking to you after this. Not because I couldn't, or I can't stand it or something, but because I think you're ultimately no good for me.
