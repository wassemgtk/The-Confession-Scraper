The semester has barely started, and it's already clear we have an ASSHOLE TA in CS 3410. I am SO f*cking tired of the course staffs of the CS courses having all kinds of egos. Seriously, try messing with the students who just got done with the low-life TA's in CS 3110. Learn to respect your students. SERIOUSLY, F*CK OFF. It's not your job to be a piece of sh*t and make your students feel bad. You are the worst person in the world. Go to hell.
