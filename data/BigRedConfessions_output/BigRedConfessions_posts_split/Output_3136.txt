I think you're the most adorable thing on this campus. We were on the same study group last semester, and I could never not act awkwardly around you. You simply messed up my chemistry. I see you way more than I wish I did, I would have liked to forget about you. I'm pretty sure you have a girlfriend. And when I see you, you're always with the prettiest girls. 
When our gazes meet and you give me an acknowledging smile though... I've never seen anything as beautiful. I can't help but spend the following half an hour melted, dumb, enchanted. I really wish I could be close to you.
