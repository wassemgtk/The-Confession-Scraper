I moved in with some of the cruelest, most narcissistic, whiny, immature beings I have ever encountered last semester.
All I can say is looking back, at least I can always assure myself that it was them, and not me. 
I respect people from the get-go but they ruined that by trying to be controlling and through their extremely rude and hurtful comments/actions. 
One thing I am definitely not is a pushover-mentally or physically.
No one other than God or maybe my mother (sometimes) can tell me what and how to do something, or live my life. 
I have enough self-respect to keep my distance, but nobody else can truly know how terrible these people are, that's the scariest part.
