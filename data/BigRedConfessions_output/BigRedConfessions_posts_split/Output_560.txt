"My favorite song is I'm from New Jersey by John Gorka and I'm not afraid to go Jersey on anyone that pisses me off. People in upstate NY and California are too soft and nice for me, and they don't know how to drive. I prefer tough people and people who know 60 mph really means 75 on the Turnpike. Come on Jersey Cornellians, you know what I mean? Girls from NJ are the hottest girls at Cornell and Ithaca sucks because we don't even have a Jersey Mike's like back home or a big ass shopping mall!

""New Jersey people, they will surprise you
'Cause they're not expected to do too much
They will try harder, they may go further,
'Cause they never think that they are good enough

I'm from New Jersey, I don't expect too much
If the world ended today I would adjust.""
