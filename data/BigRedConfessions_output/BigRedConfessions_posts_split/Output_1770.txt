Someone posted about kissing after a first date, and I thought I would share my own experience -- don't do it. I tried it a few times and it worked out rather well. But this one time, I wasn't 100% sure it would be the right move, but I did it anyway -- and the girl just turned her head and said "No..." and walked away... Not in a mean way, I think she said "Thank you though" or something to that effect as she was walking away from me, but it was really awkward and I was embarrassed. It's just not a risk worth taking and I agree with the other poster that it sends the wrong message. Especially if you really like the girl -- get to know her first, wait until the 2nd or even the 3rd date, regardless of the vibe you get from her. Even if you don't care too much what happens -- still refrain from it. It's just too forward, it's bad mannered, it's too risky. Don't do it period is my advice. It's a small campus and you don't want the awkwardness of running into each other after something like that.
