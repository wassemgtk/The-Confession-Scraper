It’s just too hard to go back to being friends after we've been together for so many years. I realized how many mistakes I've made in the past and now I've finally learned from them, the hard way. I know deep down inside you still have feelings for me and hope that one day they will show again. For now, I'm just grateful that we’re still friends because I couldn't imagine never seeing you again.
