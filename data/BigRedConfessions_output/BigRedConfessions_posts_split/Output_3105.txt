Demotivated, probably depressed, probably borderline suicidal. Stuck in a rut where lethargy means I can't get out of bed or pay attention when in class, poor grades mean I'm even more dejected. In addition to all this my personal life is in shambles. I know I need help but I'm too afraid to seek it.
