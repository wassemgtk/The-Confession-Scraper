Oh dear. Why, in an academic environment with so few of us Southerners, would you associate the activity of your high school with a region that has already been portrayed by the media as a bastion of illogical and crude activities? I am from "the South" as well, and posts like this are the reason we receive ignorant questions from our misinformed peers. You're propelling some particularly damaging narratives with statements like these. I do agree that there is a regional difference in terms of respect for your elders/educators, to some extent. I also won't fully condemn corporal punishment on the parental level, at the discretion of the parent and within moral reason. But this idea of GROWN ADULTS taking "a good wackin'" or  "a good paddlin'" in the South is a fallacious generalization that does nothing good for the region. I don't know whether you're trolling or joking or what, but some people will believe you either way. So please stop. If your high school continues this practice and has had success, wonderful for your high school. Whatever. I'm not bashing your upbringing or beliefs, especially since I can at least give you the benefit of the doubt because you said "where I am from in the South." Nonetheless, those last three words are completely unnecessary. Please, please don't attribute the activity or its success to the South. Please.
