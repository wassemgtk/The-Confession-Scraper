"Gannet sucks so much. To get counseling you need to set up a call to set up an appointment! But the only call I could take was almost 2 weeks away. And finally when I called, the earliest open appointment they had was one month away. What. The. Fuck.

And if you need assistance after 4:30PM you have to go to a walk-in clinic with a wait time of 3 or more hours."
