For the girl I met while at a show at the Hangar last summer: Drop. Dead. Beautiful. And not to mention one of the most beautiful smiles I've ever seen. We seemed to click instantly which almost never happens to me when I meet a girl. If it weren't for the fact that you said you were taking a year off, I would have asked you out in a heartbeat. Needless to say that I almost NEVER have the balls to ask a girl out.
