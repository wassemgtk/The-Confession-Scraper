I saw you today at CTB

You looked astoundingly gorgeous (as usual), while I looked like utter shit. 

I feel incapable of striking a friendship with you because I rarely come across you, both in and out of campus, however I have been conquered by your beauty.

I wish I could tell you this in person, but I am afraid you would run away. After all, I would seem to pushy on you and I don't want to give you more thing to worry about.

You beautiful, keep being who you are and what makes you YOU because that is the main reason why you are so attractive for me, and why I am falling for you.
