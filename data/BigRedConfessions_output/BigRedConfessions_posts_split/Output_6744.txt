Some people might see a spring break spent in Ithaca as boring compared to a trip to the Caribbean, or home, or just away, but I still found it nice and relaxing. I slept as much as I wanted, I actually got to cook real food, I went to the mall and took my time instead of rushing to shop and get back, I watched TV... These were all things I would've done no matter where I went anyway, it was just cheaper and without the travel hassle. Ithaca's also a nice place, and the weather wasn't even bad for break. The only downside is that my dog didn't come and visit.
