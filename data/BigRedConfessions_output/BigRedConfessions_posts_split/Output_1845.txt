I'm the type of girl who likes the simple things in life. Reading a book on a park bench, a cool breeze on a hot day, sunsets out my window, finding a dollar on the sidewalk. I find pleasure in my morning cappuccino, in the light flakiness of an afternoon croissant, in the warmth of freshly copied papers. I like to cook and to nap and to watch cartoons and in general I'm satisfied with that. I go out on the weekends and I kiss boys and I laugh with my friends. But lately, especially as autumn approaches, I really just wish there was someone I could share these small moments with. maybe drink wine on the rooftop and sleep in into the late afternoon.
