After reading #6717 (about being drunk, having sex and not remembering if consent was given or not)

In the confession, the person didn't remember if consent was given or not. So it opens the possibility that the person acted as if giving consent, and the guy believed that the actions were an honest expression of consent. I don't think he should be punished for that.

Honestly saying, the way the person describes the situation doesn't feel like a traumatic experience, and I feel like if it wasn't traumatic, then it shouldn't become. Sometimes we make decisions while we're drunk, and we shouldn't go after someone else simply because we regret it later. But if it was traumatic, then this person should seek help and support, and go after their legal rights, because using force/coercion to traumatize and use a person to get your sexual needs met is never acceptable.
