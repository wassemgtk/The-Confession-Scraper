Why am I such a total failure?
It's not that I did bad on today's final. On the contrary it went better than I expected. But there're times I just sit at my desk staring at my notes or a blank word doc but couldn't bring myself to do the work. Sometimes I can't get out of bed. It's not like I don't think I can do well or whatnot. In fact I know if I can just start I can do pretty well. I just literally can't. 
I'm so sick of myself. I don't want to sounds passimistic or ungrateful or what. When my friends ask how are you I reply doing good thanks. But inside, I just feel like a total failure.
