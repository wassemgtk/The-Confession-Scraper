I'm going to be a Senior next year, and I'm not loving going to school at all. I got involved in the wrong group of friends for me the first three years in school, and I'm looking to make the most of my last year. If anyone has any clubs to recommend, or other ways to meet people that are open to making new friends, please let me know. I know for a lot of things, being a Senior makes it impossible to get involved, but I know I can find the right thing with some help.
