"I go out every weekend. Don't get me wrong. I love to be with friends and meeting people is always nice, although a little exhausting.  But back in high school, I use to spend my Saturday nights staying home, watching a shit ton of tv, getting whatever work I needed to do done, and occasionally hang out with just one friend at a time. I was friendly in high school and knew everyone on a friendly basis, but I was happy with just a few very close friends that I sit with in class and hang out with very rarely. 

 Now, I have to make sure I finish enough homework in a short amount of time, and then party and drink with a few ""friends"" that I can honestly say I still don't know a lot about, despite going out with them. Honestly, I wish I could just live with a couple of close friends and chill with them every Saturday night, instead of going out and catching up with people whom I feel like I can't really get to know. I party, I meet new people, and then I have this overwhelming feeling that I don't actually know anyone, or have friends who can be there for me if I need them or trust me to be there for them.

I use to feel so happy when I hung out with people, because they were really close to me and I felt like I always learned something new about them after being with them. Now, every time I come back from a party/other social gathering, I still question if these people actually even like me, even though we just spent several hours with each other. Plus, I'm just so tired of small talk. 

Everyone I meet is great, but I'm so tired of this pressure to go out and socialize. Why can't I just stay in on my Saturday nights but still maintain close relationships with people? Or why can't I feel close and intimate with the people I drink/party with?
