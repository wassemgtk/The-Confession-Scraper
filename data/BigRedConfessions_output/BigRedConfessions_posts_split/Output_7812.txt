You were my first love and now I can't trust love anymore.  You said forever, you said you loved me, yet you changed your mind so quickly even after so long.  How could I possibly trust love again?  What is wrong with you and your dark, confused heart?  I knew who you were and loved you completely.  I wish that had mattered more.
