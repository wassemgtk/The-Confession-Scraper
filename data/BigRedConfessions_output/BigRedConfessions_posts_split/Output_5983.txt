I hope #2182 isn't about me. This has been the busiest year of my life, and I'll admit I've neglected some of my friendships. It doesn't mean I don't enjoy their company - I just hardly have enough time in the day to eat and go to the bathroom, let alone plan social interaction. I feel bad, but I really don't know what I can do about it.
