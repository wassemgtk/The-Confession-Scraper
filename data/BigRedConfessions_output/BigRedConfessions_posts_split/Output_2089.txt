I am in an academic rut and it's making me feel so frustrated and worthless. I keep getting straight B's. Which is not horrible but it's pretty bad when I want to apply to medical school. I go to office hours, review sessions, study groups, learning centers and spend countless hours in the library. Nothing's working. It's the end of my sophomore year and I just feel totally hopeless about applying for anything next year but I don't want to take a gap year because I won't be able to do anything productive due to my low grades. I've disappointed my parents, my sister, my community and myself.
