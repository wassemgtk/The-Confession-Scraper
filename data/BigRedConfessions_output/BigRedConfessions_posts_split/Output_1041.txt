I miss you but I can't admit this to you. What you did sunk me so low, but once the tables were turned I felt awful, like everything was my fault. We gave each other so much - love, time, effort - and now there is nothing to show of this, except your sweatshirt which I can't bring myself to give back. I'm sorry...
