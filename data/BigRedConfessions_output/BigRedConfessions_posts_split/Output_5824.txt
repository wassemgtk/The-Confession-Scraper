So for the longest time I wanted to meet this guy. Regretted not having the balls to do it. Last week I finally did and was surprised at how people can still open up to you when given the chance. Suffice it to say it has renewed my hope in humankind but more importantly I feel lighter and ready to move forward. As this year comes to a close I encourage everyone to accomplish their own to do list and go out of their way to meet that special someone. No regrets.
