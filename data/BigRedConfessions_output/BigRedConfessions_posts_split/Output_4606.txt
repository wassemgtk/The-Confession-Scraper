I hate how every year the same patterns occur with new summer friends. Every summer whenever I'm in a program, internship, etc (both Cornell & non-Cornell) it feels like everyone becomes close to each  other. We all feel (or at least act) like the best of friends and that we'll all stay friends for a long time & I keep fooling myself into thinking that'll last after the summer. But every time the minute the summer's over and we're all back on campus it's like nothing ever happened. People I felt close to during the summer now act like they never met me before & the new-friends I thought I made are now seemingly gone. Just once I wish I can make a friend in the summer that's willing to stay connected longer than a summer program keeps us together. I'm tired of having short-term/temporary friends that only last a few weeks to a few months.
