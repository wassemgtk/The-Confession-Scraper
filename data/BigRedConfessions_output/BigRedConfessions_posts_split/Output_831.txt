"I've liked you since the first day of freshman year. We were from the same place and we shared so many interests. Your being here and succeeding showed me that I could survive in this place as well. 

Yet i could never bring myself to tell you how I felt. I know that you don't feel the same way, so there was no point in asking. Not that I would have wanted you to say yes. They say that you can't be happy with somebody else until you are happy with yourself. Well I've been working on improving myself so that I can like myself better. However, it was too little too late. I'm still not at the point that I want to be at, and I'm going to be away next semester. That means that I wont be able to see you for at least 8 months, when I come back in the fall. 

Maybe I'll finally be able to forget you after all that time, or maybe I wont. When I come back, maybe I'll finally be at the point where I can like myself enough to even consider the possibility that you might like me back, or maybe I wont."
