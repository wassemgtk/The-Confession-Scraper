Today I saw someone I'm friendly with working at the RPCC Dining Hall. She's a very nice girl who obviously worked hard to get to Cornell. I was heartbroken. I'm guessing that she is forced to work a job in order to pay for her education. I can't even begin to imagine the kind of drive that takes. Now here I am, a fairly wealthy student, attending Cornell without any financial burden. It's not fair that she should have to do this. I just so happen to come from a family with more money. God, I don't know what to think of this. I'm thankful for my economic situation, and don't take it for granted, but I feel like I should be doing something more, but I don't know what...
