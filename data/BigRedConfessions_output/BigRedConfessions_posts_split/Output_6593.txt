To the group of people partying on their porch roof on Buffalo Thursday evening, you have no idea how much your honest encouragement helped get me up that hill! I had already been biking for three hours, and buffalo was the smallest hill of the day, but it was still sucky. Keep up the awesome attitudes, they make people' day! :)
