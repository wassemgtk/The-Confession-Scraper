I keep thinking I'm over you.  I can think about you without getting sad, without feeling pain...but then, whenever anything goes wrong, whenever I'm feeling even the slightest bit down, I miss you so much it hurts.  Not the guys I've dated since you.  I forget they exist regularly.  But you, you will never leave me--I mean, besides physically, which you did.  You'll haunt me forever.
