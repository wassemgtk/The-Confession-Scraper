Lately women walking in front of me have been getting nervous that I may be following them. It's been happening at least once a day - they start turning around, slightly worried, it's pretty annoying and it makes me feel like a creep, although I recognize that it's not their fault. I keep my distance, I even occasionally just turn and take a different route, because it annoys me to be perceived this way. I think the main reason is that I'm slightly disoriented and I start and stop walking at weird times and I stop and turn around sometimes, so that may look suspicious? I don't know? I'm not perceived this way in any other context, but when I am walking just minding my own business. Creeps, stalkers and rapists really ruined the normal social environment for all of us.
