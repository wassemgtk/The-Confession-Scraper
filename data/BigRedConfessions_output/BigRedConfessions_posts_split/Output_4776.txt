I tell people that I don't want to get married and I never want to have children, and people just laugh and say that I will anyway. But I don’t think they understand the severity of the issue. Now fresh out of Cornell, it feels that whatever emotional life I had was destroyed and that all I have left are objectives, targets that need to be hit. It’s as if I was made into something worse, where goals and objectives surpass emotion and freedom. How can I find someone to have the patience and heart to deal with me and how can I somehow express the feelings that may be difficult to feel? Nonetheless, how on Earth could I bring a child onto this planet when I’m just as imperfect and flawed?

Partnership and children aren’t for everyone; I beg you to try to understand that.
