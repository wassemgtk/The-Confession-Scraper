I'd say that the most misogynistic group out there are Asian men, despite popular perception of them  as gentlemen and model minorities. But you gotta talk to someone and spend time with them to really know them. As an Asian person myself, I learned a lot about them from the casual conversations we had in our mother language. Even if it's just talk, I found a lot of their beliefs, values, and ideologies towards to the treatment of women to be EXTREMELY unsettling. Especially because they were serious about them.
