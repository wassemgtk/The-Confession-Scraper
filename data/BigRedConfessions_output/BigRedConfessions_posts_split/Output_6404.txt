"Due to being a bit naive, some of my past experiences with women have left me a bit jaded and bitter. While I have learned from them, now, as a defense mechanism, I have also become more of an asshole and a dick to the new women in my life. It's a shame because some of these girls are really sweet and would be great friends but I can't do platonic. I rather self-preserve my feelings then worry about yours. 

It sucks because it's all a vicious cycle for both girls and boys "
