I've noticed that attractive girls tend to have slightly different facebook names than their real names. Like if their name is Rachel Johnson, their facebook name would be Rach Jo or something like that. Is this because they are trying to avoid getting lots of requests from horny guys? That's been my assumption, so I just haven't been sending friend requests to people like that, to avoid seeming like a creep. But if that's not the reason maybe I should change that approach. Hot girls, please shed some light.
