It's been over a year since we broke up, and I don't love you anymore. But you are a good person and I want the best for you. It really saddens me to see how clearly your new boyfriend cheats on you and you are the only one not to see it. All your friends see it (it's so fucking clear.) But he uses me as a scapegoat, and you fall for his tricks. I think you need to see him in bed with another girl to finally realize what a jerk he is, but this will probably never happen.
