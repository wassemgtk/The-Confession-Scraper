My gf's slept with many previous lovers/hook ups. I'm always worried that she thinks about them when we have sex. I hate it...especially since she's the first one I've ever slept with. Gawd. GAAWWDDD. Ach. W/E. That's what I get for goofying around with my studies for the past 3 years instead of bangin'. Shoulda done a little of both. Now I gots da 4.0 in the transcript, but a 1.0 in da real life. I is so stoop da loop mang.
