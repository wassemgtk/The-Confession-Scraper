A. I think people take this page a wee bit too seriously and I personally didn't feel the need to get into a back and forth about what is and isn't "slut shaming" in a public forum.

B. I don't think the op was slut shaming just because he/she doesn't see the value in hooking up with random people doesn't mean she thinks any less of he/she doesn't think less of their friends. Also, maybe he/she is religious and doesn't believe in sex until marriage- or has non religious values that line up the same. I think that before accusing someone of "slut shaming" without their explicit saying of that is kind of jumping the gun.  Personally, I don't really care about the hook up culture here- people who do it do it and so be it. Just because someone someone doesn't think they personally will get anything out of it doesn't mean they're shaming everyone who does it. Hooking up is fun, not hooking up is fun. But attacking someone because of their personal beliefs- whatever they may be is a bit uncalled for.  But hey that's just my opinion and I was too much of a wimp to comment on the post . :D
