Just ask her out (or him).  Send her a message.  Mention hanging out next time you see her.  It's super simple, and you should do it because why not?  If you don't do it, you'll always wonder "what if?"  If you do do it, there'll be no wondering and potentially a lot of good memories :)  Chances are that she'll say yes, since she's shown signs of interest.  And if she says no, no is just a two letter word.  Move on knowing what you now know!
