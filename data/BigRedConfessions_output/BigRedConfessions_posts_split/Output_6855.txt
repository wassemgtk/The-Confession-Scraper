I am genuinely impressed with Cornell professors' ability to just magically know your name and then remember it. I had 3 professors this semester who knew my name when I first raised my hand before I had even participated ever or turned anything in, or communicated with them or the TAs in any way, or made any sort of an impression. I am just completely astonished as to how the heck they knew my name. It's almost kind of eerie, but I am very flattered and it does make me feel cared for here, and I would just like to express my deepest appreciation that they went out of their way to try to know everyone's name, considering how busy they are and how many people they communicate with. We are such a big school, and yet it's amazing the amount of indivdiual attention we get here. Feeling serious Cornell pride!
