I don't think I'm suicidal, but I'm definitely depressed. The last time I went to CAPS, I just wanted someone to listen/hear my whole story without judgment, for the most part. But that doesn't seem to be the way things work there. The counselor I was with wanted to do most of the talking, asking questions, and if my responses were too long, she'd cut me off or get visibly impatient. Then they wanted to center my treatment around an eating disorder I'd had 15 years ago, which was by far not my most significant problem (the domestic violence was the real problem), and also not something I really struggle with anymore. I don't know what to do.
