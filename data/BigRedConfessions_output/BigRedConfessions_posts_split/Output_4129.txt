I'm starting to wish I went to an easier school and did a more technical major. I'm a senior in one of the business based majors here and find that while I've been very successful academically, I might not have the personality for some of the jobs I'm interviewing for. I feel like they want you to be like a super personable, corporate robot who has the answer to "walk me through your resume" memorized perfectly, specific answers to all of the "tell me about a time when..." questions, and certain personal qualities that I'm starting to wonder if I'm lacking. It feels like being yourself or deviating from a very specific mold when interviewing with them makes them disinterested in you. I definitely have skills, high grades, good previous work experience, and am interpersonally competent, pleasant, and at least average looking. I also know that I've made marked improvements in my interviewing skills even in the past few months. I'm more than willing to work on my own weaknesses to improve myself and have made a point of doing this. I just feel like maybe if I had majored in something different (and more technical) there would be more of an emphasis on what I can do rather than just how nicely I'm able to present myself.
