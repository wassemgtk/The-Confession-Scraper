The School of Hotel Administration has welcomed countless leaders, figureheads, and other important guests to this campus for decades and I am sick of hearing that our major is easy, you all would be nothing without us. Our students work at the bottom serving your tables and cooking your food and you should all appreciate that when anyone comes to this campus they stay at a four diamond hotel rather than some shit hole.
