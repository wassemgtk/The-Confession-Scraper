Everything is so hard for me with you because I can't shake the feeling that I was just the rebound when I want so much to be important. I'm caught between trying to distance myself to save my feelings and wanting too much to be with you when you talk to me or want to spend time with me. I know what I want but I'm afraid I know I can't have it so I'm trying (because I know I should) to push you away before you can push me away more, even though all I want is for things to go back to how they were. Why am I so stuck on it?
