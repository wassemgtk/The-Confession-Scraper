It's truly a beautiful and romantic feeling, in and of itself, to have someone break up with you and with each passing day you fall less for them and more for yourself...You slowly forgive every thing wrong in the relationship and you start realizing that you'll love again and more intensely.......Even though you don't realize you were wrong, I forgive you. :)
