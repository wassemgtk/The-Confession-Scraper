I was sexually assaulted my freshman year. It was by one of the first friends that I made in college. He was really drunk when it happened and when I told him no, he wouldn't let up. I found the strength to run away, and he later on apologized for what he did. When I told one of our mutual friends, she said that he was drunk and he apologized so it was okay what he did to me.
