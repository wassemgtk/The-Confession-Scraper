Someone posted a confession that applies uncannily to my current situation. What an unfortunate coincidence. I'm really annoyed about it because now my boyfriend thinks it's about him and is worrying about it. While it is an issue, it's not that big of an issue that I felt the need to post about it because I think we can work through it. I just don't want him to worry unnecessarily and knowing him, he will. Honestly, just bring up your problems with your boyfriend instead of posting about them. You're in a relationship with him so hopefully you've established some trust.
