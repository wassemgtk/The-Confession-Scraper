I can't fucking believe it. Even now, at the prime age of 22, my body and mind act like I'm a fucking 5 year old. What do I do when a pretty girl looks at me? I blush and smile like a fucking idiot. I can't even keep eye  contact long enough to strike up a conversation. Dumbass. Dumbass. Dumbass. It's because of stupid shit like this that I'm a 22-year old virgin.
