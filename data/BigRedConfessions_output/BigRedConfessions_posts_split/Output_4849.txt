You know I really love living with my parents but I think it's time for me to spread my wings and learn how to fly. I'm willing to do what it takes until I touch the sky I think you really just have to make a wish, take a chance, and make a change to breakaway from my parents and achieve the level of success I want, but I definitely will not forget all the ones I love even though I will breakaway from them and even though it's not easy to say goodbye. I need to come out of the darkness and into the sky.
