My best friend is not the same person anymore.  She’s been going through some complications, and they’ve been so hard on her and they’ve changed her.  And I don’t know what to do.  Last night she called me and left a voice mail in tears.  I called her back and she told me she wants to go to heaven.  This is the first time I’ve ever dealt with something like this.  She is suicidal, and I have no idea what to do.  I want to be there for her, but I have no clue what to say to her or how to deal with someone when they say something like that.  I’ve heard of empathy over sympathy, but how do you do that?  What do you say to someone who tells you they want to end their life?

How do you deal with your best friend changing as a person?  She had an infection and became septic, and it’s been messing with her brain.  Her condition is super rare, but there is hope she’ll become healthy again.  But it’s been months already and I don’t know how long this will last.
