It's depressing to read these posts on CU Confessions, especially the ones that are more serious in  nature (not the typical "i'm lonely please help" posts.)

I worked my ass off to transfer into Cornell because I envisioned Cornell as being a place where I can engage with people who are passionate about learning and have a sense of purpose and direction in life. Now I realize the depressing fact that some of us feel disillusioned and can't foresee a bright future once we graduate from college. 

When I was at Basic Training, I was so pumped and excited to go to Cornell after I received my blue cord because I anticipated that I would be in an environment that could secure for me a meaningful future once I graduated. Now seeing how others feel on this page is more depressing than light-hearted gossip that most confession pages have.
