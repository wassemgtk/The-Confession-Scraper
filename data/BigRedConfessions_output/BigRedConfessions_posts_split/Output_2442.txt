I only go around saying that I hate Cornell because it is far easier than ""I hate me.""  I hate this fucking life I've made for myself.  I hate the fact that I have spent essentially every weekend alone for the past six years.  I hate that I can have a week of extreme optimism and motivation, where I can forget my troubles, my fears, my lies and feel like I can take on the whole world myself, yet subsequently descend into an extreme depression for MONTHS on end.  I hate the fact that, despite being here two years, I only have two "friends" here.  That is, I know two people who occasionally have lunch with me.  And even when one of these two miraculously asks me to hang out, I can't respond because I HAVE NO FUCKING CLUE WHAT HANGING OUT EVEN MEANS.  I haven't had real friends for a long, long time.  What do people even do when they are together?  I don't drink, I'm horrified of large groups.  I have no interest in talking about fucking relationships or grades.  Fuck, I just want people with whom I can get really excited about the new Star Wars trailer.  Or people I can have deep talks with about science fiction novels we've read.  Or people to watch the sunset with and talk on idle things.  
      Fuck.  Who am I kidding.  I don't idle on much these days.  What little reading I do is a sad reflection of the avid consumption of literature of my pre-this-shit years.  I don't have much in the way of passions or interests.  I'm just a sad shadow of who I once was, caught in depression and not really sure why I get out of bed in the morning.  If I could find a painless way to end it, I would.   Perhaps I'll find it someday. Gotta keep looking.
