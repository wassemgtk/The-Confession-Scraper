I'm graduating next month and the thought of leaving this place brings tears to my eyes. It's the only home I've ever known. Nowhere else will you find a higher concentration of the most remarkable people on Earth within a few square miles. Not in New York. Not in DC. Nowhere else will you see anything like the out-of-this-world vista that is the view from the balcony of Willard Straight hall -- having lunch will never feel the same. Nature + the best of human ingenuity = this campus. I will sleep with my Cornell sweatshirt for the rest of my life, this will always be home, the place where I found a sense of belonging. Any Cornellian anywhere on the planet - I have your back!
