I was on my way back to North from Collegetown when I met this guy across the bridge. It was a little dark and I wasn't paying attention to anything going on around. But as I approached him, I saw him talking to himself and making very strong arm movements. I couldn't stop laughing not because the guy was talking to himself but because it reminded me that ""madness"" is real at Cornell. Some people are stressed and they can't hold it inside anymore. 

I am sorry if you noticed my laughter but honestly, Cornell is not an easy place. Very soon, I might be talking to myself too.
