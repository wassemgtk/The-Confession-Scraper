...i'm barely keeping it together. my roommate is a sly, attention seeking whore who doesn't genuinely care. i can't keep up with school...grades are well below the mean, miraculously haven't failed.. i'm trying not to slit my wrist right now that i don't know what to do...i've just come too far that i can't reach out anymore. Please, God, just let me make it through finals and reach summer when i can reevaluate my mental health and future that is slowly fading away every breathing moment... even posting this anonymous confession makes me feel worthless for posting something so trivial for most of the world..
