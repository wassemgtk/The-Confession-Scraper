I miss my girlfriend who happens to have the most amazing blue eyes anyone has ever seen. They are like the color of a deep clear blue tropical oasis pool. I'm currently in Chicago after having to spend a few weeks on business doing work for a subsidiary of a company I work for in New York. I miss her so much since she's back in New York. I imagine the trip back home in 2 weeks each night before I fall back asleep. I am sitting there in a Pullman dining car having dinner and then falling asleep in my sleeper. When I wake up the next morning we are almost pulling into NYC. As we pull into New York, I know my girl is waiting up in the grand concourse for me and soon I can tell her what I have to say: That I love you, love you, pretty blue eyes. Yeah we both love the song "Pretty Blue Eyes" by Steve Lawrence and that's playing in the concourse too and we kiss in front of everyone because we can finally see each other after all these weeks of being separated. Call me crazy, but I love my girl.
