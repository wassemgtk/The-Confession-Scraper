I can't believe I'm finally putting this into words.  You hurt me so much.  You actually broke my heart.  I fell in love with you because I thought you were funny, brilliant, caring, and exceptional. None of my friends understood how I could be into a guy like you. But I never saw what you looked like.  I saw what I thought was the beauty living inside of you.  I was actually convinced you were this incredible human who believed in everyone and would drop anything to make someone happy.  I now see how wrong I was.  You are selfish and idiotic.  You speak to people like they mean the world, but you do it in vain.  You're not interested in helping others; you're invested in helping yourself.  You treat me like a dumb child. You honestly think I'm stupid.  

I hope you're happy with her.  She's a nice girl and she deserves better than you.  You're scum. You're an asshole. You played me, and you continue to play me, and I'm too fucking weak to do anything about it because no matter how much i fucking hate you, I will always love you and I will always want to be with you.  I know who you really are now.  I've seen the disgusting person you've become so talented at hiding, but I'm still blind. I want to believe in you. I want to believe in us.  

I hate the shit you've put me through, but even more than that, I hate that I'm not strong enough to tell you to stop.
