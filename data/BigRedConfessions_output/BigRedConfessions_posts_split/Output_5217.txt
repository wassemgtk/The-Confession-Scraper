I never thought I'd grow up to act like such a shitty person. I never thought I would try to kill myself while my younger sister was around, so that it affected her so much that she doesn't want to go to school, for fear that she'll come back home to find me dead or hospitalized again. I never thought that I would distance myself from my friends so greatly that I haven't even spoken to them in months, despite the fact that I may never see them again. I never thought I would fall in love as a teenager, stay with that guy for 7 years, and randomly decide to cheat on him with a guy I'd only spoken to twice when he was away for 3 months for security work; and, to make matters worse, have him come home to the situation after being shot multiple times.
