"I really wished things worked out with us. I really screwed up and even though I probably can't fix them, I learnt a few things that I should never do again and here they are:
1) Go to the party and chat up all the hot girls and give you very little of my time 
2) Dance dirty with girls in front of you
3) Get with girls in front of you
4) Acting impulsively and saying and doing some pretty inappropriate things

You know, I so fucking stupid because I wanted you the most, but I did everything I could to prove that I didn't.

Sigh.... I need to sort out my life
