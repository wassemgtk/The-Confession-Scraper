To the Student Assembly, President Garrett, et al., in response to "Mental Health Week."

Cornell has had a history of depressed, suicidal, and over-worked students, and our reputation for suicides dates back well over a hundred years. If you want to actually address mental health on campus, then talk about the real issues that students struggle to deal with: weak financial aid, unhealthy work loads, grade deflation, sub-par and underfunded Gannett services, alcohol and "study" drug abuse, sexual assault, hazing, etc. If you're actually that out-of-touch from the student experience, start by reading the desperate posts on Yik -Yak or here Cornell Confessions. Let's have an actual dialogue on student experiences on campus, not the disgusting PR campaign that "Mental Health Week" turned out to be.
