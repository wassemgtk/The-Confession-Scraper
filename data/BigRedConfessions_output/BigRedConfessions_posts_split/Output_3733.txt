Last winter break, the guy I was involved with texted me every day, wanting to have long conversations with me and make us official when we came back. I winded up not going out with him for long when the semester came but at least there was some trial on his part. I know a month is a long time and a lot can change, but as the other guy showed, when you care about someone, contacting them is not so strenuous. Don't tell me we'll pick up where we left off when we get back. There's no way in my mind I can go through with that and feel right about it. I care about you too much now and if you don't care about me enough to even keep a somewhat regular contact over break, then it's just going to bite me in the ass even more. I can't be the fool who holds out hope because this situation is completely dismal and strange. I know I can go my break without hooking up with anyone else and I know I'm going to be thinking of you when you're 1,000 miles away. I wish you could do the same.
