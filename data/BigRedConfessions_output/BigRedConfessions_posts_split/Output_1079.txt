In response to #6948, I thought your confession about frats was extremely apt. Unfortunately I can't like it publically because I'm in a sorority and the smallest things can start drama. I suspect other people involved in Greek life agree but won't like it in order to avoid any confrontation. No one involved wants to admit it, but frats and sororities do propel a huge sense of entitlement. While I consider some of the girls in my sorority some of my best friends, I do see a lot of them going along with hookups because that's the culture. When I go to mixers, guys are very upfront about just wanting to hook up with me and nothing more and if I don't go along with it, they make it clear they will just hook up with one of my sisters. In fact when I dont go along with it, they flirt/go upstairs with other people right in front of me. It's actually pretty degrading. Also when I go to date nights/formals, guys expect me to hook up with them. Shortly after meeting a guy and going on his date night, he pulled out a condom and was shocked I wasn't going to have sex with him; his sense of entitlement was clear. Like the OP said, some frats are OKAY, just as some frat boys are. But I saw my ex get reeled into frat culture when we were dating and it was pretty sad to watch a good guy lose his original thinking and succumb to the expectations of frat life. Dating is hard within Greek life. Though not impossible, highly improbable.
