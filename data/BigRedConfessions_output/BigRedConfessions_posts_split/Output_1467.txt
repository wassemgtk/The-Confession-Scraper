I like women who have that distinct sweet NYC accent and voice from the 1940's or the 1950's. That's the reason why I fell in love my current girlfriend and we relive the days when the country was great when we go see a move or play in the city, or just go get something to eat at a classy restaurant in the city. You can see the women I am talking about in both mine and my gf's favorite movies such as North by Northwest where Eva Marie Saint stars Eve Kendall or The Clock where Judy Garland stars Alice Mayberry. Oh, I wish I could invent a time machine and warp back to the 1950's with my girlfriend. My girlfriend and I share the same ideals and she wants to be a housewife, while I will take the real job of making money for our household like the man is supposed to do. At least I know we won't be contributing to the highest divorce rate of all time once we get married, which is already past 50 percent today.
