Where can a bi girl find another girl or guy to cuddle and be with ? I feel like many guys aren't interested in bi girls and many lesbians aren't interested either... So where and how can I find someone who is interested ? And why are so many people closed minded about being with a bi girl ? All those stereotypes about bi girls aren't necessarily true...
