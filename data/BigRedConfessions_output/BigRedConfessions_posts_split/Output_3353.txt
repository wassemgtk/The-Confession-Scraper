There's this really amazing TA in one of my classes and he's the sweetest and most humble human being. He is always so patient and kind while explaining complicated concepts to me and I have gradually fallen for him. Of course, I have no chance with him at the moment and I am just one of his many secret admirers but I only wish him the best of luck in med school and hope perhaps our paths may cross again someday..
