I'm really really sorry I've been so callous toward you all this time.  I really like you, both as a friend and more, if you'd want to go there.  It's just that I'm also really intimidated by you, for obvious reasons.  You probably don't see any reason for my feeling that way, considering you talk to me in the first place, but I still do.  The only way I feel I can keep up with you is by pretending I don't have any feelings for you and I don't really care.  But I do.  It's just hard to show it, since I'm afraid you might find it amusing that someone like me would even try for someone like you.  That's why I act like such a bro whenever I'm around you, instead of the caring, understanding, and loving friend I'd really rather be.
