We had great conversations at first but now I feel like things have gotten slightly awkward for some reason.  I felt so comfortable talking to you and now I feel like the potential is still there but there's some sort of barrier holding you back.  Just be straight with me and I think things could workout.  I don't like the surface talk, have a real conversation with me.  Tell me what you're really thinking.
