I think that our school's group of student protesters regularly go too far... I understand that there are problems with Cornell's administration, and I understand that as students with the right to freedom of speech you can respond to injustice however you want, but your actions are distasteful to many students who would otherwise join you. Setting up rallies of screaming activists, verbally abusing our administrators, shouting down the people who try to answer your questions... that's not the kind of thing that draws more people to your cause. Changing your methods would earn you a much larger support base, and learning how to approach injustice with professionalism will serve you well later in life. If you think this kind of reaction would succeed in your future workplace, you're going to find yourself fired. I'm just a student who wants to be an activist but doesn't feel that the movement represents him. Your message may be awesome, but if your methods aren't, then you haven't got anything to offer people like me.
