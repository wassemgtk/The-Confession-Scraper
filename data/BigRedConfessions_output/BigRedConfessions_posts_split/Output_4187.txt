When it was raining the other night I held the door open for a girl on west. She looked up at me and said "thank you". She was beautiful. Her voice was so warm to me. For the first time in my life, and instantly, I fell in love. I don't know her name, never saw her before or after that. But I'm trying to find her. Because right now I'm up at 4 in the morning thinking about her. Next time I see you I won't be silently gaping at you. I've planned out every word I'll say to you. I don't know you at all, but since I saw you that night all those dumb love poems my English classes used to have me read are beginning to make sense. And just gotta throw this in there, youre so damn hot.
