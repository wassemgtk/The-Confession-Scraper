I get life advice from my younger brother who's 5 years younger than me. I'm happy he's more of a success than me and that he's found his calling in life. But knowing that he has more maturity and wisdom just kills me a little inside. He always talks down to me--not in a rude way, but more of in a manner of a young boss in a company giving orders to older, but inferior corporate underlings. I honestly feel like Fredo from the Godfather. I just can't manage to get my shit together no matter what I do.
