I bought myself an alarm clock because I hated having to encounter my phone after leaving my dream world every morning. I hear the ticking of it. The rough striking of it almost seems to take over my room but I need it to remind myself that I shouldn't drown myself in nothingness anymore. Every moment counts.

Yet I made sure to turn the alarm clock off when I planned for you to come here. The sensation of time dissipating visits me when you are here. I do not need any other senses. No sounds, no visuals, no scents, no tastes. Not even your touch. Your presence gives me a strange sensation. It is almost as if I am returning to the woods. I am at ease and there is nothing else I want. 

But there are just some things I cannot say. Momentary thoughts linger until they leave my mind for good. All you will be is memory and all we were will be a memory. A beautiful memory and I am so okay with it.
