Going back to what poster #6621 said about the United States being the only place where the first amendment still stands. I want to add something. Not only should you embrace other people's ideas but engage in discourse and debate and argue with others about their opinions. Do NOT accept one opinion as final but expose yourself to others. That's how people learn. Not being close minded to one opinion and sticking to it because they never experienced anything else and have lived their lives that way. I used to hate guns and thought that all people who shoot them were evil. A few semesters ago I took Handgun Safety and fell in love with the shooting sports and learned about the many misconceptions that are portrayed about gun owners and the sport. I found out that the sport is very safe compared to others and safety in the sport is taken very seriously unlike the media, that preys on negativity of everything, tries to portray it as something unsafe. In other words what I am trying to say is be fortunate you have the first amendment and use it to your advantage to experience other viewpoints and learn from others. After all that's what learning is all about and at the end realize how fortunate you are to live here in the United States as once again we are the only country that sticks to it's guns and guarantees free speech as written in the 1st amendment. Also if you disagree with someone by debating them and can't come to a consensus don't hate someone for their different beliefs. Shake their hand and tell them "peace be with you," and both agree that it was the 1st amendment that allowed you to argue and engage in public discourse. If we lived this way without political correctness or worrying about what other people say, we would have a happier and more prosperous country, if not happier and prosperous world. In light of what has happened recently on campus with news agencies being banished, stand up for your 1st amendment rights because they are the reason why Cornell Confessions is here too. If not for the Constitution and it's 1st amendment, we would be living in a very dark world without different perspectives and without prosperity. There is a reason it was 1st: because it's the most important! After all, why shouldn't we stand up for our rights including the 1st amendment, WE ARE AMERICANS!
