For those in the comments making assumptions about what kind of student I am (or am not), I'll clear it up for you.

I don't know if I'm necessarily the greatest student in my classes, but I consistently make A's and  high B's in a rigorous STEM major. 

I never intended to imply that all students feel this way, but making a generalization to denounce someone else's generalization (i.e. ""The top students in (*ahem* REAL) classes always study concepts in great depth."") is kind of silly.

My post is coming from the over-achieving, self-deprecating perspective that I feel nothing I do will ever be good enough (regardless of whether or not it is A-grade material), rather than the assumed perspective that I'm lazy, don't manage my time well, and/or have conflicting priorities.

Hope that helps.
