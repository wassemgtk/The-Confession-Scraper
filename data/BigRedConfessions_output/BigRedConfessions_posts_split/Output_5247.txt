I can't believe how far i've come since my freshmen days. My first semester, i got a 2.63 and thought id always get average or below mean on exams for my premed classes. After being here for two years, i've finally pulled my gpa above a 3.3! To those premed with low grades, keep trying! Find the right balance of fun and studying! It's not impossible.
