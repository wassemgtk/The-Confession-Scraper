"So we sat next to each other all semester not saying a word, but being In each other’s presence. I fantasized about our future - you were an award winning writer and i was a surgeon. We annoyed each other, made each other laugh, and traveled all over the world. Today, on the last day of classes, as you walked in and smiled at me, my heart jumped. I suddenly yearned for that make believe world. 
Leaving the class, i felt heartbroken that i would never again set eyes on your beautiful face - but you sat next to me at lunch. I waited- waited for you to say something- waited for a miracle. You were silent. I left.
 We were happy together in this make believe world, and although I know it’s not real, I can’t help but hope that someday, somehow, we find each other and live out this fantasy, and stay together forever."
