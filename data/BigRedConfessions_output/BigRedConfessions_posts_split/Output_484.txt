I have a high GPA, I've done relevant research. But I can't get a job. Maybe it's because I don't have internship experience. Do companies offer jobs to people with no internship experience? If I were a MechE, it would be P&G. If I were a BioE, it would be Regeneron. There are many reasons why people didn't do one; perhaps they had a family member to take care of with a terminal illness, perhaps they thought academia was their path. If they didn't even give me a first round interview, I wonder if spending an extra year for a Masters is even worth it. Do people delay graduation on purpose even if they finish all their credits to get an internship? Is there a point in graduating without a job offer? What if I'm mildly autistic and probably won't do as well on interviews? This is so stressful I'm not sure I even have the motivation to finish my degree anymore.
