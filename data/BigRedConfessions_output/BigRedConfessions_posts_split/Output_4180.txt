You know sometimes I get mad at the thought of a long line at chipotle. Not because there are a lot of people but because of the reason all of those people are there. I feel kinda annoyed that people (especially white people) get supperrrr excited over chipotle and "gwahk" both of which are pretty good but them being super enthusiastic over not the real thing bothers me. Like seriously? Lettuce and corn? Bro get out
