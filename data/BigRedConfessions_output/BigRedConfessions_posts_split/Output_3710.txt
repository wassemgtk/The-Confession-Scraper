Right before fall break I accidentally ran into a girl right in front of Statler as I was getting off the bus. As I looked over to see who I ran into to apologize I was immediately dumb struck as I saw how beautiful she was. I just put my head down and started walking to class and it happened she was going the same way. We walked awkwardly silent for a little while before she made some small talk, then as quickly as it started she had to go a different direction and I never saw her again. I think the thing I regret most this semester was not asking her what her name was. I'll take it as a learning experience I guess...
