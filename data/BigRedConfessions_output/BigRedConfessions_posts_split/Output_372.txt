To confession #7761

If this is who I think it is, we are still friends.  I feel as though you expect a lot of me.  I am a person trying to take care of myself too.  I have been taking a lot of time alone lately to reflect, work and heal.  I have been hurt a lot by my family and realizing that and dealing with that is something I feel I need to do on my own.  

The fact is that I love spending time with you but I feel that when I don't go to everything you want me to you put a guilt trip on me.  It doesn't feel good.  Try approaching it in a more positive manner and don't expect me to be into everything you're into.  

Thanks, your forever friend.
