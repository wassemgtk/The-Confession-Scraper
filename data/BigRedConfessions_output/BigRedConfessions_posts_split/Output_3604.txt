Girls who think radio silence is a good way to show you're not interested in someone - it's not. Telling them is much more effective and more polite. Unless they've been annoyingly persistent. But if they've just messaged you, or they've done something sweet to show you they're interested and you do nothing, that's pretty rude. And more awkward if I run into you later. Just make up an excuse or say you don't feel the same way, it's infinitely better. You eliminate doubt, awkwardness, you show respect for someone's efforts and feelings...
