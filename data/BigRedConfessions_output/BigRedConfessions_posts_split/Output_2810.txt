I am surprisingly hurt and upset that the person who helped me through a very tough time in my life went on a date with someone else. I shouldn't be feeling this. We never dated and never intended to, but we were a little more than friends. I'm a little bit shocked at myself for feeling this. What a fool I was to think anything would go right for more than a week.
