Today I was walking through campus and there was a white dude with his asian gf. I didn't pay any attention until he started talking about race. I guess he wasn't saying anything outright racist, but he attempted to classify everyone in the world by stereotype: Whites are explorers and scientists, blacks are the warrior race, indians are the baby-making race, asians are the cute race, native americans are the hunting-and-gathering race . WTF. I didn't know whether to cry or laugh.
