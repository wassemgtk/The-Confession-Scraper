I want to become a cop after I graduate, but everyone I know tells me I would be a loser to waste my education like that. They said a Cornell education is costly and if I wanted to become a cop I should've gone to a state school, where they actually have a criminal justice major. I don't know but I don't like the feeling of an office job. I want to be out in the field bringing criminals, especially drug dealers, to justice and making the world a safer place. It gives me more satisfaction than just a regular office job. Plus there is action everything and each and everyday is different, rather than the same with a menial office job.
