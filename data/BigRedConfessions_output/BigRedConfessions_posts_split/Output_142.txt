"A lot of people think rich, successful people are happy. However, that is not the case. I know doctors and businessmen who are divorced because they dedicated more time to their professions than to their own families. Also, wealthy people have their own personal issues. 

Furthermore, just because someone has a high paying job, doesn't mean that people likes his or her job. There are millions of employees who hate their professions, but remain in it for the paycheck. My advice is, the more you have, the more problems you have. Settle for good enough. :)"
