We met on a greyhound bus on Sunday. I was too tired and delirious after my bus ride got extended an extra 5 hours, from 14 to 19  that I forgot to get your name. Im not sure if you will ever read this But I wanted you to know I did end up being able to sleep, shower, eat, and watch TV that day! I got to do all 4! It was awesome! Anyway I hope the rest of your senior year is great! GL on figuring out whats next to come in your life!
