OP of #5619 here
It blew up in my face, as predicted. And while I am glad I was able to be myself for a while, I feel like I once again have to put on this facade for guys, then slowly peel it away. I just want to know what it's like to be fully honest with myself and other people from the start for once in my god damn life.
