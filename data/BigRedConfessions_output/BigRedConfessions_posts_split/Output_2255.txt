"Today I received what was perhaps one of the most outrageous emails in my academic career. One engineering professor emailed a group of students saying that they incorrectly completed an assignment, and specifically instructed us not to seek assistance regarding why we did poorly. The reasoning was because we would ""delay us [him and TA's]"" from grading and other course related work.

All I can say is, how dare you. It is inexcusable for any professor to ever claim that they do not have time for their own students. Especially at a university that touts the quality of its education and instructors. "
