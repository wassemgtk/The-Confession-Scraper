In the two and a half weeks I've been at Cornell, I've applied to 3 different programs/clubs that I thought sounded really interesting, and as of today, I've been rejected from all three. I understand that there are probably people who deserved those memberships/positions more than me, but everybody says that to feel at home freshman year, you should join different activities. Obviously I'm trying, and I applied to many things I was interested in, but if all of the programs are going to reject me, how am I supposed to make friends and branch out? I don't know, I'm just starting to get really frustrated.
