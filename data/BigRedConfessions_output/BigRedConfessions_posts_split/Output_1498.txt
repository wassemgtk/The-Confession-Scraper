We had never really even talked at length before today! Yet lunch with you felt so supernaturally natural. Almost like... not a dream, that's too strong, but like a dream-reality sequence. Like something out of a movie, but a quietly happy, simple movie that seems believable. I wish we had been doing this for the last two years, but I'm glad I had the time to become the person I am today. The old me wouldn't know what do with someone like you. I mean seriously, you're so... ALIVE. Such a human being at your core that I almost feel like you know something I don't. How could anyone be so comfortable and warm? I thought I was the only one like that, which was foolish of me... Anyway, I  hope we can talk again, very soon. :)
