I made the biggest mistake of my life coming to Cornell for grad studies. With no internship over the summer I have no hope of getting a job to repay my student debt. I got out of a long term relationship before coming here and I thought this would be a new beginning, a chance to change my life, start over and be happy and may be find someone in the process. Turns out, life is worse than ever. How can one semester, one huge slump in the gpa erase every accomplishment and piece of hard work you have done all your life and put you in a position where you are drowning in debt with no hope whatsoever. I wish I had never been giving admission in the first place and then I wouldn't have been tempted to put everything on the line to be here. Is this what everyone calls fate? destiny? If yes, I can feel the hard punch in my face
