Abusive parents have a way of making us feel guilty.  I dealt with similar experiences growing up, and I've started talking to a CAPS counselor.  I am still dealing with the effects of the way my dad treated me growing up, and one thing I realized is that it's okay to say that he is a jerk (you could use harsher words if you wanted - I personally am not much of a swearer).  It's okay to say that out loud and to acknowledge it, and it actually feels good doing that.  And it's okay to focus on yourself and not feel bad about doing that.  I think I know your conflicted feelings - you love your dad and appreciate the good sides of him, but the bad sides are really bad and make you want to avoid him.  I've been there, and I'm thankful that I've been able to grow a little away from my own dad while at Cornell.  I'm realizing that I am a real person with valid feelings, and if he doesn't acknowledge how I tell him how he makes me feel, then it's okay that I don't want to spend time with him.  We are young and figuring out our own lives for ourselves - our parents had their chance to do that; now it's our turn.  It's super easy to set up a CAPS appointment.  Even if you can't get one right away, I would sign up for one and go to it.
