I'm down for any commitment level between FWB and actually dating, all I want to do is have sex, play video games, watch TV, and smoke pot sometimes. I work really hard on being a chill, stress-free person to be around. But every time I try to start something with a guy, even if they know all this and even if they say it's what they want, they chicken out. Cut a girl a fucking break.
