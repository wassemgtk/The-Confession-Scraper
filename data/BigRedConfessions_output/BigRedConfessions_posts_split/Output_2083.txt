I hate my family more than anything. My father is abusive, and my mother has been driven crazy by him. Every single conversation I have with my mother is about something my father has done. She pressures me to stop talking to him, but he pays a small yet important part of my college tuition. 

I have an internship lined up, but it doesn't start until late June. Until then, I'm home, with no one to talk to. All of my Cornell friends are on the other side of the country and actually have decent relationships with their families. I can't wait to be back in Ithaca, I'll be much less unhappy there, 2,000 miles away from all the bullshit people call family.
