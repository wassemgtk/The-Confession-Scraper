So a while back I read a confession about how just holding a door for someone made someone's else day. Since that day I always try to hold doors for people or just do little things for others (like cleaning the driers filters) in the hopes that one day I will make someone's day just a bit better. If I come across as "annoying" for doing that, I am sorry, it is just what I want to do for others
