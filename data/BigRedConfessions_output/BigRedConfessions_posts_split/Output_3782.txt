I've known my girlfriend for 5 years now and we're going strong. What I've noticed though is how much she treats me like she's my mother--incessantly doting on me, scolding me when I do something stupid, picking out my clothes for me, making sure I exercise and eat healthy, making sure my grades are up, getting work experience, etc. Having been orphaned early in life and gone through a string of abusive and negligent foster homes, I can honestly say that she's a godsend. I love every minute that she spends with me--even when she pesters me to death. I never respond in anger and always take it in stride. A lot of guys I know have said that she's nagging and clingy and that I'm less of a man for putting up with this behavior--that it's an unhealthy relationship. But it's not. I love how much she cares for me and I have not sacrificed a shred of my masculinity. I'm confident, I speak up for myself and my close friends if one of us is being bullied, and I plan on fully providing for myself and her financially. So eat shit haters. I'm in love with this girl and I'm man enough to say it.
