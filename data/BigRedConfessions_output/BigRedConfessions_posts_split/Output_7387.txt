One confession may be about me, but even if it is not, I want to say sorry for being creepy and clingy in September. I literally had just stopped communication with my ex boyfriend whom I still loved dearly and I felt the desperate need to fill the gap. I'm really sorry and I am not normally like that, I promise. I hope you can try to understand.
