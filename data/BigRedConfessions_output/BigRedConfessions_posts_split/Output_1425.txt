There are some really reasonable and good points, some questionable and incomplete information, and some ignorant or downright wrong points in your confession. But I'm not here to break everything down into detail and start another back and forth (this wonderful page already has enough of that going on with the troll.) Instead, I will simply suggest you reach out to the Sun with a public response to be published. You'll be heard by more people, taken more seriously, and have the opportunity to both seek and offer clarity as it pertains to your viewpoint. Also, you'll be as brave as the young woman who wrote the column by putting your name where your mouth is.
