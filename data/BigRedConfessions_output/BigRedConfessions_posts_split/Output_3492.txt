There is this girl  who thinks she is God's gift to the world. I'm not berating her for her appearance because we all have the right to and should love ourselves. Yet, this girl is completely arrogant about her appearance without due cause to be. She's the type to berate others for their appearance and puts others down because she thinks she's hot and she's really not standardly pretty by any means. It's such a warped point of view. Even if she was really pretty she wouldn't have the right to be cocky but the fact that she's not is even more disturbing. It's weird how there are girls who are actually conventionally pretty who don't think of themselves as such even though they are told so and are very humble about themselves and yet there's girls who are not who think they have the right to spit on others. This is so middle school, but it's disturbing. Beautiful or not, no need to act like a bitch who's better than everyone else.
