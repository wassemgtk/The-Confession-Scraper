In the morning I when I am coming to Cornell I usually see cheerful students getting on the bus talking about their wonderful lives full of joys and excitements and parties and blah blah. In the evening I read this page and I see mostly depressed students confessing about their awfully unpleasant lives full of miseries and stresses and sufferings and blah blah. Maybe people can talk about the gloomy side of their lives only anonymously. Or, maybe the unhappy students do not take the bus.
