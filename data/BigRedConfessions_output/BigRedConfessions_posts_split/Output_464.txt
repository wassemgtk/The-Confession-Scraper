"I'm a recent alumnus and am currently in a journalism program, where I'm working on a feature article about depression in college athletes. I'm looking for someone to interview who is willing to discuss their experiences as a college athlete at Cornell who has dealt with depression, so that I can hopefully raise awareness of this issue. 

Since this is such a sensitive issue, I can provide as much or as little anonymity as my participant would like, and I'd make sure to create a safe environment where the student can share as much or as little of their story as they feel comfortable. 

Since this post has to be anonymous, if anyone is interested, please write your email in the comment and I'll contact you. "
