I hate the fact that I sacrifice so much of myself for others. It's my best and worst quality. My ex broke up with me out of the blue while I am abroad this semester. She found someone else, and do you know who she cries to when no one makes her happy or understands her? Me. I gave her advice for her new crush...... I couldn't let her suffer even though in my heart I know she brings everything on herself.
