I'm asexual, and I feel really uncomfortable with how often my friends talk about boys. I don't want to hear it, I don't find anyone hot, and I feel grossed out about it sometimes even when it's mild, but I also don't know how to tell my friends I'm even asexual... I feel like they'd be annoyed and think I view myself as better than them because I don't care about sex.
