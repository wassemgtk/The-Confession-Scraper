Going through a breakup while taking classes at Cornell is not easy. Three years of being best friends and partners to being strangers. It's been two months since the breakup and it's still hard to get out of bed sometimes. It sucks because being sick with the flu is a valid excuse to pause your life and stay in bed. But a broken heart? You have to keep moving because you can't wallow in that sadness forever.
