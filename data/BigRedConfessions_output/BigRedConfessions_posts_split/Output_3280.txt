To the people hating on the kid making the comment about his credit limit. The beautiful thing about credit is that it doesn't depend on you being rich. My family isn't exactly well off and I started building my credit when I was in Middle School. It depends on you being an excellent and responsible borrower. Having a $100 limit on a card and using and paying back $7 even looks great. 

Even just get a card, use it for the 1 time per week you get coffee, pay off the balance, and your on your way to building your credit.

There are very wealthy people who have terrible credit because they don't know how to correctly manage it, even though they pay everything in full and on time.
