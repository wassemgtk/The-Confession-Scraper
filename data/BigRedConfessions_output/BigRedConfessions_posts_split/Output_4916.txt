I used to love my sorority, but the way the older girls talk down to us is getting kind of ridiculous. I am your equal, not your inferior. Stop treating me as though I only serve to exist to make the house look good and recruit new pledges. Regardless of what you think, wearing my hair in a bun and not looking perfect when I wear my letters does not reflect as poorly on the house as youd think. I'm not sure why most of the older girls in my house act as though being a year older gives them some ominous power over me and the right to tell me what to do. I joined to form bonds and friendships, not to be told what to do by girls who have been put in, and enjoy flaunting their arbitrary positions of power. This is a sorority, not military school. I have had an extremely busy summer, and will have an even busier sophomore year. I find it kind of insane that I'm expected to, and even forced to participate in events to avoid fines. Time to deactivate.

My friends in other houses feel the same way. As a message to all rising juniors and seniors in sororities, please take some time to realize that we joined sororities to have fun and make friends, and while we are willing to do some work to make that happen, being nice to us and not threatening us with various fines will go a lot farther in cementing bonds.
