I have never been one to associate sex with love. It has always felt more lusty and animalistic, and I've never really felt that a connection with a person was amplified from having sex; the 'love' was already there and basically stayed the same magnitude. It was just that - sex.  Attraction leading to a physical act with pleasure for both parties. Don't get me wrong, pure lust and frenzied sex can be awesome. That's all I'd ever known since I was 16 and I enjoyed it a lot. And then I had sex with you. I barely even know you. Sure we've talked a lot, and I liked you beforehand, but there shouldn't be this feeling in my chest whenever I think back on that night. I've never had anyone be so tender, taking things as slowly as you did. I was at first caught off guard - I'm used to guys ripping my clothes off without much hinting from me that it's ok. But you took your time. And made me want you even more. I always thought attachment after sex, especially after only one time, was crap. But damn, boy. I was not expecting to made love to that night so sweetly. And now I'm afraid to do it again, because I could see myself falling for you, head over heels, and I know it makes no sense, but wow. I'm going to have to do it again, because that was the best sex of my life. I don't know if you felt it too - maybe that's just how sex always is for you. So I'll keep things casual for now, but lord have mercy, please don't hurt me.
