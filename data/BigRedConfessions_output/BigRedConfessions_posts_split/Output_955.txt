I hate when people decide that leaving their stuff on a desk in the library for hours on end during finals week somehow reserves the space. I graduate this semester and have only one final on the last day of finals week so I plan on spending most of my time up until then hanging out in the library moving peoples stuff to the floor if they leave for longer than 30 minutes cause those guys are jerks. Anyone feel free to help me out if you want
