"I can't wait to go back to Cornell in a few weeks!!!........oh wait just kidding i already graduated. Its only been a few months but something about that place really sticks with you after graduation (in a good way) no matter what shit you went thru there. 
Though I spent more days riding the struggle bus than the TCAT, Cornell will forever be awesome, so cherish it guys. "
