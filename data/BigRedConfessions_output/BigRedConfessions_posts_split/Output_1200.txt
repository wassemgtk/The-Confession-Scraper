I remember when Cornell was dressed up in Christmas decorations until the politically correct people came and destroyed the tradition. It was so neat to have Christmas trees with stars inside Willard Straight Hall and a star on the top of Barnes Hall lighting up the tower. I even remember having hot chocolate ice skating on Beebe Lake with my girlfriend who is now my wife of many years, and us sitting near a campfire near the lake until curfew time came for my girlfriend to return to her dormitory. We even went sledding together the next day and built a snowman. I hope kids can have it that great again while attending Cornell, specially when they get snowed in.
