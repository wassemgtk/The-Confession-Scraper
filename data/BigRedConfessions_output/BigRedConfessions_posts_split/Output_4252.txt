I've recently come to realize that I'm not ready for a relationship, and that I actually very much enjoy being single. Still, sometimes when I see a couple sitting together on the slope enjoying each other's company, I get a pang of longing (or perhaps envy?). We have such a beautiful campus it's a bit of a shame I haven't really had/taken the opportunity to share it with someone. Happy October everyone!
