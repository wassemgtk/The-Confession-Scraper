Amongst all these depressing posts, I'd like to say I absolutely love Cornell. I have met the most fabulous, intelligent, beautiful, caring, and open-minded people ever, and I'd like to say thank you to every single one of you for making my first year of college a blast. First semester as an engineering student has been tough but definitely rewarding. I'm looking forward to 3.5 more years of this incredible school. Class of 2018, you have a lot to look forward to :)
