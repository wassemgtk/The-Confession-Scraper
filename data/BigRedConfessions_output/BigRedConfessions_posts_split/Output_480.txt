I hate my body. I keep trying to loose weight, keep trying to eat healthy, keep trying to feel comfortable in my own skin, keep trying to like the way I look in clothing, but it never works. I just can't seem to loose weight no matter how much I work out, and I might as well give up. I will never be the weight I was in my junior year of high school, I will never be that beautiful again.
