My sexual frustration is reaching a peak at school and I simply don't know where to turn anymore. For months on end, I've gone to parties where my friends have made out on dance floors and in some cases even taken the girls they've met back to their rooms to have sex. Girls really do have it easier than guys here; all they have to do is walk into a frat party and they'll have 10 takers willing to grind with them and hook up with them. All I want is to hook up. I'm doing well academically, but I can feel my focus dwindling and my motivation crumbling. To see smiling faces holding hands all around me is disheartening. All I want is to have a girl by my side who wants to be around me and hold my hand. All I want is to go to a party and hook up with a girl- just once. I want to know what it's like. I'll never ask for anything else in life, but I want to experience the thrill of sexual contact with another girl while here. I'm feeling increasingly hopeless about the situation.
