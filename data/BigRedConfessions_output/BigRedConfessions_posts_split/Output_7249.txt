"To the tall girl with curly hair who always wears a bright orange ski jacket, 
I see you walk through RPCC all the time and your gait makes my heart stop. I live in the townhouses so I see you around all the time with four other girls who pale in comparison to your radiant beauty. It's almost like they're drawn to your orange beacon of allure and sexiness. If I could get just one chance to talk to you, I would tell you that you're my orange-vested unicorn. Rare, mysterious, and utterly dazzling. And mmf, those long, lean running legs are just so...prancy. Let me be your unicorn lover <3"
