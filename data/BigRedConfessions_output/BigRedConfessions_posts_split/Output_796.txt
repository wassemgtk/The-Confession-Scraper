I am at peace. I can write. I can be fully myself--especially all the wonderful parts that I hide from everyone in Ithaca. I can write. I can play with my little brother. I can stay out until 4:30 in the morning with my best friends. I can write. I can hug and kiss my mother 10 times a day. I can immerse myself in the culture of my family and friends and city. I can write. I am in love with these moments and with this time.

Even so, I can't say that I don't look forward to returning to school. Certainly not now, or anytime soon. But when the new semester does eventually roll around, I won't be complaining. 

Everything's good now and everything will be good later, I've decided. I have PLENTY to be upset about, both here and there. But I don't feel like dumping all of that on you today. Like 7225 said, I'm not in the mood to contribute to the negativity right now, though I would add that I welcome every ounce of concern, sadness, and pain from others on this page. We all need to be heard. 

Much love to everyone. Much love to you. Much love. :)
