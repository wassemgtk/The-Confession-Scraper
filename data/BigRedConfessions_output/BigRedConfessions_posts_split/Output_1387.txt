Not to draw away from problems that women face but I think there's a lot of unrecognized sexism against men as well, and it really frustrates me that a lot of people don't take me seriously. For example, guys are often victims of rape and domestic violence (at a rate of 1/5 to 1/3 of the total victims, if you don't count prison rapes) but do you know what happens when you call a hotline regarding it? "Sorry, this service is for women only." Fucking hell, as a victim of sexual abuse...
