Please stop acting like all these guys are thirsting after you because they send you friend requests or text messages. It's embarrassing to listen to you act like you're so much better than them because you think they're unattractive. Did you ever think that maybe they're just being friendly? Get your ego under control, especially since you're the size of a small whale.
