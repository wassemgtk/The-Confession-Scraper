I got scorned at the other day for wearing a shirt of Che Guevara. It didn't bother me initially. It's just a shirt that I didn't think too much about when I purchased it back home and packed it into my luggage.  But as the day progressed I noticed that I received more unpleasant stares. But they got me thinking. It's funny that we're always told who our heroes are and who we should look up to. MLK, Ghandi, Mother Teresa, etc. They left out Che from the history books (or mentioned him briefly) because it went against the capitalist agenda.  But after long, intensive research of the person behind one of America's most marketed faces (oh, the irony on both sides), I realized that he was one of the greatest men of the 20th century and his cause was noble, as he stood up against the most powerful empire in the world. I don't regret pissing off those people. Â¡Viva Che!
