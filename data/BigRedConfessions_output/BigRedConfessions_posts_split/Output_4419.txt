"Recently I overheard an older lady speaking to another lady about how women are still so degraded by society in that they are addressed as ""bitches"" so I wanted to make a PSA and let everyone know about the three different varieties of the ""bitch"". 

The first kind of ""bitch"" is the most common: the type of ""bitch"" that is screamed across College Ave as a freshman girl who believes she is more inebriated than she really is (after half a Keystone) identifies another girl or group of girls that she lives across the hall from in Low Rise 6. Usually the word ""bitch"" is paired with a tasteful ""LOVE YOU"" or ""HEYYYY"" before the sacred B is uttered. This ""bitch"" is also used to refer to powerful women (and homosexual men in some cases) who exude charisma, and a seeming disinterest in the opinions of others (The ""I don't care what my haters think they just be jealllll"" variety). This ""bitch"" is usually paired with a tasteful ""fierce"" or ""hot"" added before the sacred B is uttered. Examples include Beyonce, Queen Elizabeth, Karl Lagerfeld, etc. This variety of the ""bitch"" is harmless. Actually, it's a huge compliment (I would love to be called a bitch tbh). 

The second variety of the ""bitch"" is someone who is actually a bitch. This bitch is the bitch that stole your boy(/girl)friend or the bitch that stole your parking spot at Soul Cycle or the bitch who ""accidentally"" dropped his/her Pumpkin Spice Latte on your MacBook.This is a real BITCH. Notice how I have stopped putting ""bitch"" in quotations. Yeah, because that guy/girl is actually a bitch. This bitch is meant to hurt. This bitch is usually used with no preface. When the perpetrator is a real bitch, the following words are used to describe the variety of bitch they are: f*cking bitch, stupid bitch, whore ass bitch, biggest bitch in the land, wicked bitch of the east, bitchqueen of the bitchuniverse, etc. Let us clarify that this malicious form of bitch is still not anything close to sexist. A man or woman can be a bitch. If they do something to you that is rude, inconsiderate, and just stupid, they are a bitch. Simple as that. In no way, shape, or form is this supposed to be a knock on the social status of women. 

The third variety is the female dog. In some cases, humans resemble  female dogs in which case other humans mistake him/her for a female dog. Though bitch is not used to describe a female dog in most parts of the country, some people still do legitimately use bitch in this fashion. This is absolutely harmless.

There you go. Your guide on the three types of bitches. #yourewelcome
