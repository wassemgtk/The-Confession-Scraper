I know you haven't stopped loving me. 

I haven't. 

This was beyond puppy love. We were and ARE entirely real.  

I've tried imagining me with another person and I just can't.  I don't know if I could ever reach this level with another person.  Nobody else could so swiftly walk through all the walls and barriers that I've built to protect myself.  Nobody. 

You saw me grow, you HELPED me grow so much.  You know me better than I know myself sometimes and I know you too.  

Hold on to that love.  Please.  

Don't you realize how great we are together?  Don't you realize our hearts beat together?  Aren't you mesmerized by the feeling we have when we look into each other's eyes?  Remember when you used to whisper romantic things as I was sleeping?  Remember how like two puzzle pieces we fit perfectly on one another as I laid my head on your chest and slept for the night?  Remember I taught you how to skip rocks on the lake and you taught me to dance at my first college party?  

You do.  I do too. 

I pray for you every morning and every night because you are still the first and last person I think of.  Heck, I see you even in my dreams.  You're a part of my soul.  Losing you is losing part of me.  And I'm trying really hard to not lose myself entirely.  I'm incomplete and I don't know how to fix it. 

And yet, I cannot and will not force you to anything.  Loving you means that I must comply with what is best for you and if this is what is best for you....hopefully time becomes my best friend. 

Damn.
