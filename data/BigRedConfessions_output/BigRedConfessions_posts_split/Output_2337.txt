The grade deflation Cornell students experience — relative to peer institutions — is a huge hurdle to our future success. I left a traditional "STEM" major, not because of the incredibly demanding work of the classes, not because of the terrible instruction, not because of the disorganized advising, and not because of the very structured major requirements which would have severely limited my ability to explore different academic subjects (one of the main reasons that I came to the College of Arts and Sciences in the first place), but because of Cornell's relative grade deflation; the grades that my friends and I have received are all too often not reflective of the work that we have done in these incredibly demanding classes. I understand that the Administration at Cornell wants to avoid the grade inflation at peer institutions (the median and most frequent grade at Harvard is an A, over 50% of grades at Brown are A's, 62% of grades at Yale are A’s, etc.). Showing median grades on transcripts was a good first step, but admissions officers don't differentiate between absolute and relative grades when comparing grad school applicants (see "Inflated Applicants: Attribution Errors in Performance Evaluation by Professionals," Swift, et. all.). The grading system needs to be reevaluated if the Administration doesn't want to hinder Cornell students pursuing internships, jobs or admission to graduate school.
