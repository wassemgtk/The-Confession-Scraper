As we near towards graduation for some and summer break for others...it is essential that you remember one thing. 

You are loved. 

You are not defined by your accomplishments, your failures, by where you are working next year-next summer, who your parents are, where you're from, by your fears, by your sexual assault, by your regrets, by your illness, by your wealth, by your poverty, your friends, acquaintances, or enemies, by who you've hooked up with, by how many beers you've chugged, by your university, by your research, by your GPA, your admission to grad school, deferral to med-school, the desires of your parents, friends, family and of who they want you to be. You are not defined by any of these things, and above all you are loved.

Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, and endures all things. Love never fails.
