I love my boy friend to pieces, it's the little things, his little quirks. But sometimes, the things he does that seem like no big deal to him, make me angry. Like not texting me for a day, starting a conversation and not finishing it, being emotional available one moment, and emotionless the next. But the worst thing is him not telling me how he feels about me, and expecting me to know. I'm horrible at guessing and assuming, so unless it's said, I will never know. I know it might be hard, but what about me?
