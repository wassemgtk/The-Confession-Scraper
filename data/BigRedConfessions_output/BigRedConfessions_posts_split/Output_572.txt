Last semester there was this gorgeous freshman boy on my dorm floor who seemed to be completely unaware of his looks(always wore a cap & shorts combo) and seemed pretty shy/solitary, but who I never managed to talk to. I was planning on making a move this semester, but I've yet to see him at all and I'm afraid he transferred :(.
