I find it absolutely disgusting that the UN Women's conference equated cyber harassment to physical violence and that it undermines actual assault and sexual assault victims immensely. Example? Meanwhile thousands actual women like Cytherea who are violently raped get little to no support and are ignored by the false "professional victims". The fact that they actually want to PROSECUTE people exercising their right of free speech on the internet is horrific, but their utter hypocrisy in who to selectively use as examples just makes it so much worse. I'm entertaining the notion that people like those idiots are actually fully aware of what they're doing and they're just trying to get attention by saying the stupidest, most controversial shit imaginable.
