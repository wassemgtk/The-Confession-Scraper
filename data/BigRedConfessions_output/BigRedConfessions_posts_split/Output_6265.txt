My roommate is my best friend. I'm so glad I met her. I'm super excited to live with her next year, but I'm also really nervous. I know that I really like her as more than a friend, but I'm afraid to tell her. Especially now that we are going to live together again. I don't want things to be awkward around us when there is literally no way to avoid her.
