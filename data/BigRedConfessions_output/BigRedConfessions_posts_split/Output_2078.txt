You really think I was into you all of fall semester? I don't know where that's coming from, since we didn't really hang out that much in the fall and never hooked up or anything. And I had your number and we were pretty well acquainted--don't you think I would've made some type of move? Asked you to lunch or just to hang out or something? I guess I'm just confused as to where you got this idea.
