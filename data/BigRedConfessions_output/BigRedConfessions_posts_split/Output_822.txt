At first, I was really sad. I really missed you. But it's gotten better now. Now that I've been on my own for a bit. And I've realized that it's not you I miss anymore. You were kind of an egotistical asshole anyway, lol. 

What I miss is having that person, you know? I'm sure I'll find someone great someday, maybe soon, maybe not. But I'm impatient, I guess. I want my person again. Someone to tell random things to, to listen to music with, to rant to and watch Netflix with, to be crazy and stupid with and to talk about life and intellectual things. Someone to study with, or not study with, to have crazy sex with and to cuddle and do absolutely nothing with. And yeah, I know everyone wants this and I'm being stupid and just have to let it happen. Sure, I've moved on. I've been with other people. But I guess I just haven't found that reciprocated connection yet. Maybe break will be good for me. But I just hope I find it.
