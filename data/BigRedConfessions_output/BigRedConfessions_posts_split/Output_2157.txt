So I have somewhat photosensitive skin and I hate this time of year when everyone stares at me oddly. It's bad enough that I'm sweating through my long sleeved shirt and pants, but do you really have to make rude comments about it? I had a group of laughing girls follow me while calling me a weirdo and a Wednesday Addams wannabe...
I would have hit you butt slugs with my umbrella if it didn't mean getting a rash on my face.
