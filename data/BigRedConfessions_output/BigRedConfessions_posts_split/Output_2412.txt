Men move mountains to be with the one they love. You're a coward. You're heartless and immature. I was always trying to figure out if it hurt more to be with you or if it would hurt more to be without you. I was so stuck and you made no effort to make things better. I had genuine love and respect for you. You aren't perfect but that's partially why I loved you. I realized that you abandoning me was the best thing you've done for me in a long time. I always felt alone when I was with you so nothing changes for me now that you're gone. Please don't do what you did to me, to anyone else. Often times I'd rather suffer physical pain instead of the constant emotional pain you subjected me to. I hope the memories we created together torture you for the rest of your life. You will never find someone who will put you first and themselves second like I did. I hope you live in regret. I hope it eats you alive inside.
