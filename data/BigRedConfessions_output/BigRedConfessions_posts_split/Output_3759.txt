I can't believe it. I was pretty good friends with this girl from a strip club up until last Friday night. We were just hanging out (playing Halo) and I went ahead and asked her out. She just started laughing at me. Not to be mean or anything. She's a pretty sweet person. But I think in her head it was just so ridiculous because I'm nowhere near as attractive or popular as her. Keeping in mind this was the first time I asked out a girl, my self-esteem just took a nosedive. It's one thing to get rejected. It's another for it to be taken as a complete joke. Well in the end I just started laughing too and said I was just joking. A couple of minutes later I make an excuse and go to bed where I cry myself to sleep. Thanks.
