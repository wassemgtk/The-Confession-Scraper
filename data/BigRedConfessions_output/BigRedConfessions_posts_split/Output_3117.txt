I really thought this semester would be ok. I had some friends that I actually liked, a manageable course load and i got a fake. Then all my friends wound up in different houses for rush and I never see them anymore. I thought that we would still hang out, but now when we do, its all they can talk about because its all they really have time for. We just used to casually hang out and drink but now it just feels like they pencil me in between events out of some obligation. I would try and branch out more but I really don't know how to. My classes are at too weird times for most clubs and I find it really hard to meet people in my classes. Even if I'm not opposed to hook ups, there's not a big enough reason to go to bars without them anyway. I just wish I had some social outlet other than drinking at this point. I'm usually pretty happy alone between my research, my work and movies, but lately I'm just too lonely to not have anything else.
