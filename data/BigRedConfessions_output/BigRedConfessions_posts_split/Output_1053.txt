Ladies, ladies. Please! Wipe your little sprinkles off the seat. No one wants to squat over them or clean up someone else's dribble. Also, please remember to flush at all times. Cause sometimes you forget. Look behind you to make sure it all went down. Gentlemen, I've walked in on you twice now in that certain secret unisex stacks restroom. You are not the only person who knows about that haven of privacy, and that's why the lock is there. Please make use of it so you don't have to clear your throat to warn me. I'll try to remember to knock next time. 

This is all like Kindergarten 101. Why are these things an issue at an Ivy of all places? 

Oh yeah - don't forget to look up from your phone and look both ways when crossing the street. I have seen some of you not do that. I don't want you to be hurt.
