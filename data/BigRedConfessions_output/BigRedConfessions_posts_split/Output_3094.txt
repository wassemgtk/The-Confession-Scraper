alum here. thanks to cornell's financial aid policies and mentors who took a shot referring me for interviews, my life has done a 180. for the first time in ages, i love my job, social life, and living in the City.

wanted to just post a message of encouragement: to all the kids grinding and hustling to rise above the 2-7 that the world dealt you, keep your heads up. this is the last stretch before it gets hell of a lot better if you kept your eye on the prize and put the work in.
