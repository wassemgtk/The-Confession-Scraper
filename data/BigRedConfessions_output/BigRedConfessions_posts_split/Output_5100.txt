"So you're just going to end our friendship by doing what you've been doing since March....ignoring me. Wow. The only conclusion I can come to is that you really don't care about our friendship at all, and I'm starting to wonder whether you ever did. You were happy to talk to me when you had no one else to talk to, but once you got a life I was no longer needed. That's a pretty low blow if you ask me. 

I recognize what I did wrong and am sorry for it. I have said sorry so many times. I've been nice, I've been harsh, I've said it every way I could think of. I don't know what you want from me anymore.

You certainly had the time to write those messages about how horrible you think I am, but apparently you don't have time to even discuss how we can move forward. You claim to be so mature, and yet you don't even know how to say sorry. 

Be an adult. You can't just ignore me and think I'll disappear. After all, life doesn't have a delete button.
