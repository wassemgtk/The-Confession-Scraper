Whenever I see a woman carrying a heavy suitcase or groceries or struggling physically with something I always offer to help and I always think -- oh they're going to think I'm a creep -- and in all fairness they almost never take me up on the offer -- but they always seem flattered and exceptionally polite. Chivalry is not dead!
