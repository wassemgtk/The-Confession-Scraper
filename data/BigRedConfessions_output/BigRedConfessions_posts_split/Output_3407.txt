She felt relieved that it was over, and it wasn't until a few minutes had passed that the tears came. She cried. She cried at what had happened, cried at who she had become. When had she gone from the sweet, hopeless romantic to the girl that gives her body away so easily? Why had she let him stay? Why hadn't she said no? It was her fault, it had to be, she agreed to it, she wanted it, she never said no, she didn't ask him to leave, it was all her fault. She felt dirty, she felt used, she felt like a whore. She tried to sleep, to put it to rest, but all she could think about was his face, his words, the way he touched her, his teeth pushing into her skin. She stood up and looked at her naked body in the mirror, she looked at her bruised breasts, her tear-stained face, her tangled hair. She went back to bed, but she couldn't sleep. How could she sleep on the sheets his body touched, how could she sleep on the pillows scented with his sweat. She got up and showered, she scrubbed her skin to get him off of her, to get the feeling of his hands off her body. She took the sheets from her bed and threw them on the floor, she changed her bed sheets and pillow cases and went back to bed praying for sleep, blaming herself, trying to cross this off as a bad decision.
