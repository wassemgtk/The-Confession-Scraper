I have done things in my past that I am not proud of. But I am trying to change, I'm trying to get my life back together, I'm going to my classes and being responsible in social situations. I know I have lost control in public places where I should not have lost control. To those who barely know me, and continue to reprimand me for my past -- it makes me cry when I hear from people that I just met and I tried so hard to make a good impression that you have told them about the worst parts of my past. I don't want to be reminded of my worst moments. Its also not your story to tell. I'm not someone who has a lot going for herself anyway, and whatever pleasure you get from ruining what little I have, its disgusting.
