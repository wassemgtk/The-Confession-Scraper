Anyone who believes racism is dead should watch that leaked University of Oklahoma frat chant, THEN try to tell me that exclusivism isn't part and parcel to the current fabric of this country, and that age-old hatred doesn't echo into the present day. I'm pissed off. Waka Flocka made the right call in cancelling that concert.
