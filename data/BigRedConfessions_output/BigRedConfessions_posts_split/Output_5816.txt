"I wonder how to get my spark of life back...
It's more than a little dismaying to go out with friends to eat, only to stare at the menu and find everything sounds just as unappetizing as it ends up being, or to be unable to bring myself to sleep until after 4am every day. Every time I fail or get a terrible grade, it seems harder and harder to pick myself back up. And then my friends talk about what we're going to do next school year, and I always feel that panic that I'll blow my second chance and not come back. Maybe I don't want to. 
I don't want to die, I've heard of peole finding their way after dropping out or scraping by, but living is such a terrible chore. "
