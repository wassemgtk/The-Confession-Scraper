I know this is uber late, buuuutttt to the guy at phi sig on Halloween who ask me if I was from Washington heights/Harlem b/c I was hispanic. Ugh I thought you were really cute and I'm mad I didn't dance with you or something. That comment just offended me b/c I get that shit from a lot of the Americans here and wasn't expecting to get it from a hispanic kid. Anyways youre cute. Bye.
