This is more a response than a confession, but to the girl who wrote the opinion article in the Daily Sun on 10/20: I have a few points to make.  

First of all, whether or not multi-cultural sororities/fraternities have a house depends on a lot of other things - it's not like the rest of the Cornell Greek system (which multicultural organizations are a part of, FYI - it's not two different systems) is saying "Oh, you can't have a house, but we can."  Chapter houses are can be extremely expensive ventures, and chapters (depending on their national organization) usually also have to be able to have enough members to live in those houses to justify and support that kind of venture.

Most importantly, I have never experienced racism from any of my Panhellenic sisters.  Ever.  I'm not saying that there aren't racist people at Cornell, but calling the Greek system that as a whole, especially at Cornell, which has such a diverse student body, is ignorant.  

Now to address what you said about the aftermath of George Desdunes' death.  I didn't know him, but had sisters who were friends with him.  What happened shouldn't have happened; that's a fact.  But to say that the entire Greek system (which happens to encompass a third of Cornell's undergraduate student body) should have been held accountable and punished for the actions of some of the members of a single chapter is, to be frank, silly.  Yes, there should have been, and always needs to be education and programming in regards to alcohol and hazing, but to punish a third of the students on a campus that is already mourning the loss of a student would have been even more devastating.

I know that that's your opinion, and you're welcome to have it, but want to know my suggestion?  Try to get to know the Greek system, and the people in it.  Our letters don't change that fact that we're all individuals.
