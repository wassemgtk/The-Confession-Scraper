I graduated from Cornell in 2013. Now, I am unemployed and receiving unemployment benefits. I have been to 5 interviews and they all rejected me. Some of those jobs I interviewed for were internships. The labor market is really tough. I strongly recommend that you guys prepared yourselves by getting internships during your college careers, even if those internships are unpaid.
