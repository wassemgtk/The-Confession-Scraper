Guys who masturbate 1+ times a day - first of all, you need to bring that rate way down to at most twice a week or the constant stream of dopamine will seriously disrupt your normal brain function. Second, make sure to switch hands. Especially if you've done it so much that you've developed a tolerance and now need highly increased pressure to get off (which by the way, let me tell you, no real vagina will provide). At that point it becomes an intensive upper body compound exercise that you perform twice a day or more. What ends up being affected is your forearm, bicep, tricep, delt, chest, lat and the corresponding half of your trap muscle. You are gonna get so asymmetrical you won't be able to work out with barbells anymore and will need to use dumbbells for additional reps on your non-jerking half just to balance it out. Excessive masturbation affects your entire body negatively, including your brain. Do it once a week just so you don't lose your mind, and guess what - that will also give you the motivation to go out and talk to girls, of which there are plenty of gorgeous ones on this campus. And you'll become a better, more balanced person overall. All of the above is obviously speaking from experience.
