How does one get over someone. I have been in love with one of my closet guy friends. It hurts because I am sure he knows I love him. Then again, he might have feelings for me. But who knows when neither of us will make the first move. What does it matter anyways? I am at Cornell, and he is in the Midwest. I love you baby, and I really wish you can see this.
