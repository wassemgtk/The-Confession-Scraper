I got really sick earlier last week and I had to go to the hospital. None of my "friends" wanted to go with me because they all said that they were "busy". I have never felt so alone at Cornell. 

In my freshman year, I went with my ex-roommate to the hospital the day before my final. Even though I failed my exam and got an awful grade in the class, I still do not regret my decision. As a premed student, I really believe that caring for our colleagues and friends is so important. I wish that the people on this campus would care more about each other and not obsess over whether they get A or A+. Please, spare some time in your day listening to the people around you. Offer your help. Do not brush people away without a good explanation. Your kindness will make a difference in their lives. Make it count.
