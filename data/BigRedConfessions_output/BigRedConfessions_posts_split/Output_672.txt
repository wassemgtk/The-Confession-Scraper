You know how sometimes you feel like you are trapped in a cobweb, or a room with glass walls? Like, you can try your hardest (well, think that you are anyway), tell yourself every day that you need to get out, and you need to figure out the damage that you have done to yourself, and that you need to change and you need to be a better, more responsible person, a person who embraces their accountability to themselves, and their family and their friends and the world around them? Do you know that feeling where you are watching your life go by like watching a terrible spectator sport or reality show? A feeling where you have no sense of control, where you are observing your life rather than living it, where you deal with situations passively rather than proactively? Do you understand what it feels like to not have a tangible list of goals or internal desires, and instead set arbitrary goals based on conventional ideas of success and fulfillment, because even being bored but rich is better than being bored and poor? Do you understand the irony of living life without having an all-consuming passion for something? You know you are average, perhaps even above average, but you know that even if you lie between the 70th and 80th percentile of human beings in the world, based on success as defined by both conventional lifestyles and new age philosophies, you are mediocre. You are OK among the OK. Do you feel scared to live certain days with the realization that you are hollow on the inside, with no discernable personality traits? You put up a brave face and you tell people you know who you are, almost flippantly, with an air of nonchalance, when on the inside, you are breaking into a nervous sweat, terrified of being called out for who you truly are, a shadow human, an empty vessel, a piece of gum that clings on to person’s boot and travels with them. Do you know that you are lying to yourself every day when you say that eventually, when the time comes, you will wake up one morning with zeal and vigor and start achieving your destiny with furious intensity, but you know this is a lie because you have no destiny because you are literally no one? How does one describe you? Who are you? What are you? What defines you? You probably don’t know the answers to these questions either, because if you did, you wouldn’t be reading this. 

Probably the shittiest part of this shitty shitfest is the fact that knowing this doesn’t change anything. It is like being awake while under anesthetic: You are aware and attuned and can feel every painful moment on your skin but are unable to do anything about it. It’s like watching yourself cut yourself every day, tiny little cuts just breaking the surface of the skin, oozing out bright red blood and leaving a thin white scar that is visible only to you, mocking you for your complete lack of power. You feel emasculated, held captive by your own shitty personality (or lack thereof) that cuts off your balls and leaves you like a withered cloth, to be tossed around by the wind.

Sometimes I wish I would just die. Not kill myself, because that would be an active decision, but just die. Quick, easy and painless. After all what is the point of being alive if you have nothing of value to contribute to the world around you. It would be such a relief to binge watch a TV show, binge eat Cheetos and binge drink whiskey and pass out and never, ever wake up. Because, I don’t know about you, but I am tired of doing nothing and being nobody. All my life, all I wanted to be, was to be unconventional and unintentionally admirable. Yes, I scoff at the idea of being and being around traditional role models but I have always wanted to be a Kurt Cobain: someone who lives by his own rules, defines his own morality, dies too young and inspires a whole generation of kids to come, reaching almost mythic stature posthumously. But I am neither unconventional nor admirable, just an empty shell.

What would you do, if you were me? No seriously! Because I am approaching the brink of desperation. Good advice, self-motivating talk, writing things down; nothing helps. I feel like I am beyond the point of no return and I am just standing at the edge and grinding my feet into the cliff side and hoping that the next strong gust of wind (getting fired ha ha) will not push me right off into the abyss. How do I simplify my life? Why am I so in the middle with regards to everything? I wanted to be unconventional but I failed at that, however now I am at failing at being a conventionally successful human being as well. I am envious of the very people I mocked in my teenage years: computer engineers, MBA’s, suits in corporate jobs. They may be cogs of a big fucked up machine that crushes the poor and the middle class but at least they can afford a nice apartment, and take vacations, and get promoted?  They may not be Pulitzer Prize winners but neither am I going to be one if I am twenty five years old and still unpublished! They may not be Grammy nominees or performing at MSG or Radio City or even the Village Vanguard but at least they learned how to play that fucking guitar they bought and have fun strumming along to pop songs? Do you think sometimes your snobbery, be it with respect to popular media, music, editorials, food or even shopping, is just a veneer to hide behind: To mask the absence of a personality with contempt for conventionally happy or “basic” personalities? 

As every day goes by, I am starting to feel that I am trapping myself further and further and deeper and deeper into the grave I started digging for myself. Soon, no one can reach me to pull me out because I will be in too deep. There is only a point up to which people can help, beyond which the initiative, the drive and the courage to change must come from within. But when you feel like you are unable to get a foothold then you can’t climb up, even to reach out to people who are standing by the edge just ready to help. Or maybe all of this reasoning, all this pondering about maybe you suffer from depression, that maybe insomnia could be the cause not the symptom of said depression, maybe you have repressed issues that are manifesting in the form of anxiety, depression, lethargy  and procrastination is just your shield to hide away from the terrible truth: that you are making up all these problems to search for an excuse to justify what a shitty human being you are, that you don’t work hard because you are incapable of dealing with struggle and failure and too lazy to push yourself, that you are incapable of learning and growing, have no marketable skills and just generally a waste of space on this planet. Now what? What do you do if this true? It is so easy and convenient to blame something or someone for your failures than to accept that you are the problem, not the subject facing the problems, because where does one go from there? 

I wish I had the courage to do something. Mostly I wish I had the courage to kill myself and make it look like an accident so that my mom and dad will get the insurance money and be less burdened by debt than they are now, debt brought upon them by me, for my stupid “education” and stupid “career” that is going nowhere, for my lack of responsibility, for giving me a shot at a life I don’t deserve and will never live because I just don’t strive hard enough. If not die, I wish I had the courage to quit this job, go back to India, become a nomad and try to write my book, but we all know that is not happening. OK, I wish I had the fortitude to go home and practice coding and learn things on Coursera and study and write the Java OCA exam and become a certified coder, but NO, because I can’t function as human being if I am not numbing my mind with TV or alcohol. All I do, is wallow in self-pity, until I feel a hint of self-satisfaction and it is back to Netflix and junk food and booze till I black out. And so the cycle repeats.

I give up.  I just fucking give up. Period. Because I don’t know what to do anymore.
