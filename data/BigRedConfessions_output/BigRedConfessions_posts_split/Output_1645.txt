I need to start asking for references next year for grad school applications. I've been trying to build relationships with my professors with this in mind, and also because I genuinely admire their work, but I feel like they all hate me. I try to only ask "good" questions (but not too often...I seriously only go to office hours maybe once a month), I try not to waste their time, and I try to be respectful yet confident. I don't know what I'm doing wrong. 

(The other day I asked one of my professors a question during office hours. One of the TA's was nearby, and the professor motioned her over and said, "*Exasperated sigh* You deal with her," before going to help a few other students, to whom she was very nice.)

All of my teachers in high school loved me. All of my professors at the school I transferred from loved me as well, and were more than happy to give me references and help me succeed. Maybe I just don't understand the culture here. I feel like such a failure.
