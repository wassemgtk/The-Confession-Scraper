Today I woke up to the most debilitating depressive episode I've had in months. My entire body ached, my head was pounding, and I could not bring myself to feel or to get out of bed. It's times like these when I feel like my entire year of recovery was for nothing, but then I remember that last year I felt like this every day for weeks on end. One day out of many isn't so bad.
