After I graduated Cornell, I no longer associate with many of the people that betrayed me. They are losers. The majority of students here are brainwashed liberals that will never be successful in life, working for someone else rather than making it on their own and being their own boss. They couldn't even shine my Brooks Brothers oxfords.
