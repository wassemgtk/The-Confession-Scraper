what's with cornell students being so secretly envious of the other ivies? No, I'm not some hostile columbia student, but seriously, why can't I even mention harvard in a conversation without people here jumping down my throat about how we're academically "on par" with them because of the whole Ivy League moniker. It's like there's some sinister groupthink that enforces this heavy delusion on us, and that all of this shit is due to some inferiority complex that plagues everyone here. Like, why can't you admit that you weren't good enough when you were applying to college? I, for one, am totally open about not getting into Yale or Columbia, my top two schools and instead, I willingly accept that some people are better than me, more deserving of a truly top-tier education, and ultimately, get what is justly theirs. It's saddening how we have to keep our inferiority out of sight, out of mind, and frankly, this mentality is babyish. One of my friends even told me that some drunken kids, late at night in in collegetown, nearly beat him up due to his wearing a harvard sweatshirt. Really, guys? Quit being prestige-whores and accept your place.
