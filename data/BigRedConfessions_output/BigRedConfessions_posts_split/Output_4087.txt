There is this girl in one of my intro classes who is the cutest thing ever. She has the sweetest personality! I think I'm starting to care for her, but I have no idea how to let her know. I hate my self so much, my physical appearance and more, that I feel completely unworthy of her or anyone. Even though I feel as if she is giving some signs that she may be interested, I feel as if she would automatically reject me because of my appearance. Whenever I enter class, I decide that I'm going to tell her that she looks nice today or something along the lines, but I chicken out every time. I want to hint to her that I'm interested, but I'm too scared and I don't know how. Can someone please help me out?
