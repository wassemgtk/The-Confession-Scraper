you think I'm over you because I'm dating someone else. but that couldn't be further from true. and I don't think you're over me either. I'd leave him in an instant if it meant enjoying these last precious weeks scooped in your arms. but until then, he's a security blanket, and maybe the right choice. so man up before you lose me forever.
