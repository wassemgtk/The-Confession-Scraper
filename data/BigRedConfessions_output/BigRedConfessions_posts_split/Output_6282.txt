Can I just say that I find the housing system on this campus absolutely appalling? Not only is the layout of this campus awful, extremely spread out, and hilly, this goddamn school only guarantees housing for two years. How is it that in a place that has as much land as Cornell does, they can only guarantee housing for two years. It would make them so much fucking money to build dorms instead of closing down East Avenue FOR A YEAR to build a glass atrium in one of the most beautiful Gothic parts of campus. Do we actually need another cafe and some more offices in Goldwyn Smith? Instead, build a few more dorms, and stop making the housing process so fucking miserable for everyone who gets a bad time slot. I have no fucking idea who decides how money is allocated but I'm pretty sure whoever is in charge is an absolute idiot with no concern for the well-being of students. We already go to school at one of the most stressful places on Earth. Could Cornell not make this ONE thing just a bit easier to handle?
