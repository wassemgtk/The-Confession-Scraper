"""During my first year here at Cornell, I attempted suicide in my dorm room popping pills so that I could end my miserable life. I didn't think that I belonged here at Cornell. Everyone here was so smart, having fun, and being carefree. I would look at everyone on my floor and be disgusted with myself because I wasn't sure what I was doing wrong. I didn't have any friends and my roommates didn't talk much and were very quiet all the time. I struggled to find who I was and didn't do as well I should have done in school. My mind was always preoccupied trying to fit in with the social norm. It came to the point where I couldn't handle it anymore and I tried to overdose myself. I thought it was so easy and painless. I knew that in a second or two, I would drift away. I was prepared. But, for some reason, my roommate came in at the split second around 1 am and punched me yelling at me what I was doing. He saw me holding a bottle of pills and me with a mouthful of drugs. That was when he told me that he cared about me and apologized that he didn't know I was going through such a tough time here at Cornell. At that moment, I began to cry and tears began rushing down my face so fast that I couldn't control myself anymore. I always wanted a friend here at Cornell and while laying on the floor, I found one. To this day, I am eternally grateful for my roommate. He saved my life. He is my best friend and for three years, he has been my side always making me feel better and being there for me. I can honestly say that I love him so much for what he has done for me. If you're reading this now, I wanted to tell you that you mean so much to me. You helped me bounce back my life. It is quite funny that you are right behind me sitting on your own desk writing your paper. But, I just wanted to let you know that you changed my life. There is nothing I can do to repay you.

Thank you so much! Thank you!"""
