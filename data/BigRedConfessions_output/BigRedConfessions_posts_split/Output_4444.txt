When I was 15, I witnessed my best friend getting raped. She and I didn't know what to do at the time, but we are still really good friends to this day. Sometimes at night I'll have nightmares where I re-live the event, but only I'm restrained down and physically cannot help her at all. I sometimes blame myself for not being more courageous and saving her that night, and I know I shouldn't feel that way but I can't shake the depression sometimes.
