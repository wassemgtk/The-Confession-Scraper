To the "Cornell won't save you" graffiti people:
Keep doing you. Even though the message you're conveying is overwrought, unnecessarily edgy, pointlessly nihilistic, highschooler-watching-fight-club-tier bullshit (the kind of universally true revelation that immature folks find ""unique"" depth within), I love how it pisses people off around here. Just watching people get so genuinely butthurt over something so stupid is funny in and of itself. Peace and love mate
