I hate being poor. There's the stigma others put on us of being poor, like we/our parents aren't as hard working or like it's somehow our fault. There's also the constant judgement my parents cast on me whenever I make any independent financial decision. "Why did you spend $1.50 on water? You could have saved it up. Or if you were determined like us, you could have waited til you got home to drink from the tap." Even when I got a job on campus, they still shame me for spending anything that wasn't absolutely (and I mean absolutely) necessary. When I ran out of BRBs last semester, I would skip breakfast and lunch and just use my dining hall meal swipes for dinner. Yes I have money in my debit card, but I can't bring myself to spend money. There's an extreme sense of discomfort whenever I pull out my debit card. I feel disappointed in myself for not being as frugal as my parents, and I feel ashamed of myself whenever I occasionally buy coffee at the cafes on campus. When I'm conscious of the fact that I'm poor and that I inevitably have to spend money on something, I criticize myself for being weak-minded and frivolous. And maybe I deserve to be poor if I can't be financially strong-willed. All I know is that I'm going to work ridiculously hard and land a good job and never have to worry about money for me or my parents ever again. Because being poor absolutely SUCKS.
