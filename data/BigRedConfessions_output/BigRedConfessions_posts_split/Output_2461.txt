I am really scared to drive. I failed my driver's test a while ago when I was in high school, but then passed it somehow a few months later on a closed road obstacle course which they have in the back of the local DMV. I haven't driven much in the past especially when I'm I was in college for the past 4 years. Now I have to drive to my job and I don't know what to do as I cannot rely on anyone or public transportation. Is anyone else scared or anxious to drive or is it only me? I feel like a loser since I am about to graduate from Cornell and can't drive. I don't think I will ever find a girlfriend especially, if she figures out I can't drive to a place for our date. :(
