"My therapist is not that much older than me (like 5 years), she always wears skirts and she keeps crossing her legs during the session. I could clearly see her panties every time. I try to look somewhere else and be professional, but itâ€™s so frequent that I catch myself looking sometimes.

Omg she is hot. I wonder if she does this on purpose"
