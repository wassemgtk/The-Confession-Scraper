As a law school student, I have to say I am as proud to be a Cornellian as I am grateful that I didn't attend here for undergrad. The Greek system at Cornell is the most exclusionary, discriminatory, broken thing I've ever seen. It's hurting social life in this already isolated place immeasurably. Cornell is one of the most divided places I've seen, the only thing that brings us together is the shirts we wear, otherwise the experience is vastly different for different people, largely because of the Greek system. Us grad students stick together - Law, MBAs, PhDs, all have their unobstructed communities and we all hang out at Big Red Barn, Chapter House, etc. Sororities at Cornell are ridiculous. They select EXCLUSIVELY for attractiveness. The very top one has the hottest girls, essentially looks like a bunch of Fox News anchors, the second most selective a little less, and so on. Even Republicans have black people and hispanics, but you guys don't have ONE ugly girl in your top sorority. How is this even allowed? That's like hiring people based on physical attractiveness, and pretty much that alone. You're not too inclusive of other races either. The exact same goes for frats. And you only date people from a "corresponding" house? What kind of a British royalty-style inbreeding, fueled by an utterly offensive system of discrimination is that? I know a version of this goes on in most top schools, but I must say Cornell is truly at the forefront of community-ruining invidious redzoning of some of the smartest people on the planet.
