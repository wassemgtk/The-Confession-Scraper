"I'm not going to be able to see you tomorrow.  I want to put all that I can into this new relationship which means not spending time with exes and making him jealous"
This is the text that my boyfriend of 1 1/2 years sent to both break up with me and tell me he is in a new relationship... we hadn't seen each other in months and were scheduled to finally see each other/talk things out.  My heart is broken and I can't stop thinking about him... this is going to be a great christmas...
