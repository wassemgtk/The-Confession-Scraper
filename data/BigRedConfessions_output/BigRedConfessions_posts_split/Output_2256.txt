With all the stuff being posted about how people hate Cornell, I just felt like I needed to say this. Without Cornell I don't know where I would have ended up. I am an international student from a family with an income of less than $100/month. Quality education was only a dream for me. Cornell is the only place that has felt like home for me and the people I have met here are the most wonderful people I have ever known. It has its problems, I know, but no matter how much pressure I'm under, I never want to leave from here.
