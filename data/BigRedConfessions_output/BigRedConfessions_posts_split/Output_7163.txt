I really want to rip your clothes off but that's not going to happen anytime soon because I'm a giant pansy and couldn't gauge your interest if my life depended on it. For now I'm just happy to have you as a friend because you're so damn cool. and talented. and kind. and beautiful. My insanely attractive, strictly platonic friend. fml.
