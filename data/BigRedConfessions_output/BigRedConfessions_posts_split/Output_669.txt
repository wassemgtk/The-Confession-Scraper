I wish I would just have a heart attack and die. I have been thinking about death for the past 10 years or more but I have never had the courage to attempt suicide or even try simple self harm like cutting, which I did only once as a self punishment. The thing is, to everyone who isn't me, my life is rosy, so nobody understand why I am depressed or a serial procrastinator. I myself don't get it. I have amazing supportive parents, a sibling I am getting increasingly more connected with, great friend, a degree from Cornell and even in job! I don't understand why I can't try harder at work, or at least drive myself to find a better job, if I hate this one. I don't know where all my money goes when I hardly shop. Maybe alcohol! But I am no closer to paying back my student loans. I never really struggled in life but I feel like I am always tired. I know I will never be daring enough to pull the plug, but I can't keep on keeping on like this.
