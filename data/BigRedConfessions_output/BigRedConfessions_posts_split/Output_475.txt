Throughout my life, a big part of my identity was aligned with Christianity. Sunday mass, holidays, community service, and Passion Plays made up my youth, and I am grateful for the experiences. But recently, college life has led me astray from my more puritanical upbringing. Several of the clubs I'm in have pushed me towards the party lifestyle and away from prayer and reflection, and my cognitive dissonance (between my sinful life and Christian beliefs) has driven me to suicidal thoughts. Some of my Christian friends have been passive aggressive and judgmental towards me, and I feel more alone than ever.
