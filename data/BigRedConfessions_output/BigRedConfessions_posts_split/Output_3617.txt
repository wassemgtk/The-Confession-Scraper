I was in one of the buildings that no one usually goes to for studying during finals week. Well sometimes I get stressed and start singing shitty opera. I thought I was alone and was frisking along dancing ballet in the hallways and singing in my "opera" voice. I came to an open classroom and saw this dude studying inside. Well, after that I ran back to my classroom and didn't bother with the stress anymore. I figure if I didn't die of embarrassment, there's little in this world that can cause me anguish--even failing finals.
