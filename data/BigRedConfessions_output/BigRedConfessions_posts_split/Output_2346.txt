I am an international student currently on a full scholarship at Cornell.  I started freshman year full of vigor and determination to do well and make my country, school and especially my family proud. Being a first generation student, the pressure on me is immense even though my family tries hard not to show. Freshman year went by in a bliss even though my spring semester suffered from incertitude on what career path to take. Sophomore fall I decided to switch to the pre-med track. That semester was a rude awakening. I got a warning concerning my grades but managed to pick myself up this whole semester. Now that the semester is about to end, I am constantly afraid I will do badly in one or two of my classes and be told to go on a leave of absence. I party and have fun but first and foremost work hard and try my best to keep up with work. Deep down I know my hard work will pay off but the fear of failure and being asked to take a leave of absence keeps nagging me. I'm not sure this is the best platform to let all this out but I really feel less scared as I type these words.
