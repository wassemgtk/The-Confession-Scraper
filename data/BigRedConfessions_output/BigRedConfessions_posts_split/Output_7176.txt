A few of my guy friends came up to me recently and told me that their friends want to ask me out but are intimidated by me.  I don't know what to do and it makes me feel bad to hear that.  I am a down to earth girl and want to have a relationship.  But, I don't know how to change this.  I don't even think I am intimidating. It that just an excuse?
