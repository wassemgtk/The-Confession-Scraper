I shouldn't even be talking to you because, while it is innocent now, I know where I want it to lead and I'm still extricating myself from my current relationship. I'm just so turned on by our stimulating and witty conversations that I can't help myself. It's been so long since a man to whom I am attracted showed genuine interest in my world and, even if nothing significant were to become of us, I'm so grateful you showed me that I wasn't as dull and unattractive as I thought the stress of school had made me, just with a man whose world had diverged from mine. Thank you for that.
