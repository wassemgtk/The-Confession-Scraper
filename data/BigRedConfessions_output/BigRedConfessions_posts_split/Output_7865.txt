"Dear beautiful blond girl who was in 1817 last semester, (are you in 2612 now?)

The only thing more beautiful then you was your love for the class and willingness to talk to Kirshner afterward.

You always say hi to me with the most beautiful, incredible smile. But I never respond back... 

I think you know who I am, message me. I'd love to take you to get coffee for all the times your smile and hello has brightened my day.
