"I'm a senior. It's been a great 4 years - but a part of me wishes I'd spent a little bit more time meeting and befriending ""interesting"" people. My group of friends is alright - but that shit gets old you know? I've spent the last few months going out of my way to talk to and interact with people I wouldn't have otherwise, but in doing so I realized something about Cornell...

People here SUCK. Seriously.

Politeness here has become so rare that people mistake it for flirtation. Case in point - asking a girl to grab drinks and chill with you, and she thinks you're hitting on her. (The fuck?)

People are NOT very open to meeting others, especially if they don't feel like they're on the same ""level"" or social scene. This shit works both ways - striking up a convo with the anime club running around uris, and the dudes feel like I'm too ""fratty"" and ignore me. Try to chat with a dude with a sweet classic camera, the fucker blows me off. These are just two examples, but you get the idea.

On one level, its made me realize how insular the whole campus is. People here really do self-segregate, and as much as Cornell touts how diverse this place is, the quality of the student body could really improve. Not when it comes to ""race"" or ethnicity, but peoples attitudes. This place is really full of insecure social social climbers with HUGE chips on their shoulders. 

I just want someone new (and interesting) to chill with. Is that too much to ask? I could care less about how your dad just closed this huge deal at some bank dude. Talk to me about life, your aspirations, your feelings - anything but shitty topics that contribute to the vapidness of the people on this campus..."
