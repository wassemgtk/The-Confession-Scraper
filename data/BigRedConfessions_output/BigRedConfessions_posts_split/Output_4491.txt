I am currently stuck in the "can't get a job, because I don't have experience, because I can't get a job" loop. I have been rejected from every engineering project team thus far and it is stressing the hell out of me. You know what? Fuck it. I'm going to build my own damn machines. My own vehicles. My own planes. We'll see who is inexperienced then (cue evil laughter). (No seriously, if I can't get onto a project team then I'm screwed as far as internships and jobs).
