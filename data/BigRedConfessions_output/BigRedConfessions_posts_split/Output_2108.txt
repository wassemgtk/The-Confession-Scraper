My sister and my mom hate each other. My parents hate each other. My dad and my sister no longer speak. But everyone loves (and vents to) me. They won't go their separate ways because of me though they're all miserable. It's like I'm the glue holding a broken hourglass together. It's super depressing seeing the sand run through the cracks and I'm terrified to see what happens when time runs out.
