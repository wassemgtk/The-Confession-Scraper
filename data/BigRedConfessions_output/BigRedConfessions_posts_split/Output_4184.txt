This semester has been emotionally draining on pretty much all of friends.  Over the past month, every single one of us has had some crisis, from various complications.  While its been stressful, I'd just like to say that I'm glad everything happened because not only have we all become closer, but our group has grown as a result.  I'm thankful to be surrounded by fantastic people here, but if things could just calm down for a while, that would be nice.
