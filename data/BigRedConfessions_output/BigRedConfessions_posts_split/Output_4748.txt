Yesterday I was on tinder and this girl told me that her biggest fantasy was for me to stick my toe in her vagina while we were in a public jacuzzi.  So in response, I was like ""that sounds good, wanna have sex?"" And after that she blocked me.

So sticking my toe in ur vagina is fine but having sex is crossing the line? Wtf?
