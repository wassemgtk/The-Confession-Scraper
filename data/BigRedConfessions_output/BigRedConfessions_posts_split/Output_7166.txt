My friends drive me crazy in the best possible way. Every time they frustrate me or disappoint me, I'm reminded that I only feel that way because I care so much about them and because I know how wonderful, capable, and incredible they are. They've helped me through some of my worst moments this past semester, and I couldn't be more thankful for my support team. They're by no means perfect, but they're absolutely perfect for me. Thanks guys, I know it's been rough the last few months, but I honestly wouldn't want to be tackling these challenges with anyone else.
