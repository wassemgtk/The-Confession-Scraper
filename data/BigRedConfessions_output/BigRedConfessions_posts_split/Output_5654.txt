I'm really sick of the video circulating Facebook, the one criticizing social media in forced rhyme. Excluding the hilariously obvious fact that it required Facebook to become popular, as well as the over the top emotional appeals, it isn't a new thing to ignore people over technology--my parents and other adults have talked about similar treatment with transistor radios, newspapers, walkmans, etc. There are many things wrong with the overgeneralized messages in the video, such as the huge exaggeration of smartphone use (at least from what I see among my friends), and even at Cornell, I rarely see people dumb enough to walk across the street with a smartphone. It's important to have balance between everything--how is there anything wrong with using a phone on a bus bench, just waiting?--but the video just makes it sound evil in general, and to me that seems lazy. (It'd probably be more able to address both sides of the issue if it didn't try to chain the message to an annoying rhyme scheme.) I also seriously doubt that, before smartphones, everyone walked up to every stranger they met to talk. I think we should use that sort of technology less, since it's distracting (although I personally don't even have a smart phone), but we shouldn't turn them off or throw them into the gorges. I'm going to stop here, but the video has so much more available criticism...
