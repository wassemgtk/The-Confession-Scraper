To the Student Assembly, Gannett Health Center, President Garrett and people who currently are in struggles: 

To be boldly honest with you guys, I love the opportunities, resource and classmates in the school. Yet, the reputation of depression hasn't been regulated a bit EVEN the school increases the fee of our health insurance. 

I have experienced family loss which result in depression and grade suffering. When I actively asked various department officials for help , they would basically said:"I would like to help you but I am actually not in charge of this issue, you may want to talk to your advisor/director/dean/professors/bursar office/ financial aid office/ Gannett etc". Guys, Cornell is a BIG and DECENTRALIZED campus, I need to walk to different buildings and tell everyone about my circumstance again, again, again, again and again, but no one could actually speak behalf of me(I understand it's my responsibility); it drains my energy and frustrate me when they kick me back and forth like a BALL in the snow; eventually I could not find a reliable people. In the end, they would ask me sequence of doubtful questions"have you thought about commit a suicide/ Do you hate people etc." with doubtful/anxious/pretended caring attitude. Eventually, they would ask students to take the health leave in order to protect the school reputation, because if you make any troubles outside of the campus, that would not be their responsibilities since the school official and Gannett ask you to leave. (*Please don't misunderstand me, I am not saying health leave is a bad idea in some situation) Eventually, it's like an infinite loop, the depression in the school will never be regulated effectively.

I stay positive, but I need your help to be vitalized; I need your actual support and advice while studying in the school with depression then gradually come out of the struggle. A setback is a set up for a comeback, our Cornell students have potential come through struggles then thrive. The system of the school has the problem; it's too decentralized when dealing with depression problems. You need to get in touch of our experience and stop kicking students like a ball in the snow then traumatize us; this is the serious issue.
