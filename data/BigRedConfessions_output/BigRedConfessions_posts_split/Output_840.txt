I have never lost anyone but I have had dreams where I've lost people close and dear to me. Even in those dreams I felt truly devastated, lonely, and hopeless. As much as I would love to end things and save myself the pain of living in this world, everytime I get close to taking my life, I see his face and I can't bear to be the one that delivers a blow like that to him. I should be thankful for him in every way possible (and I am) but I can't help feeling angry at him for giving me a reason to live. Sometimes I feel so sorry that I am the one he fell in love with.
