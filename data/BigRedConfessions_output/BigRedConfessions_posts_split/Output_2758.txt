I finally know what it feels to be screwed by the system. Seriously, my advising dean and the extremely bitter, opinionated and rude professor (he never lets students finish talking), how does it feel to push the head of a drowning person back into a bathtub of hot water? I am already depression/anxiety/insomnia-ridden and you are now officially my primary source of misery.
