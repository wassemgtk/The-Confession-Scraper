As a senior who has a job after graduation, is it really necessary for me to give a shit about finals? As long as my overall GPA doesn't dip too low, does it even matter whether I get Cs in a couple of classes? I'm just feeling overwhelmed with all the studying I have to do and it's so tempting just to give up and watch YouTube videos. As long as I'm able to graduate do my grades really matter? Sure, I'll be fucked if I want to apply to grad school (there go my dreams to do research) but honestly, coming to Cornell has only made me realize how much my intelligence (or lack thereof) has limited my ambitions. My only goal is to graduate and live a life where I'm happy. So I'm just tempted to give up on this whole finals thing and for once, enjoy the days leading up to the holidays.
