I think more unattractive people should be in media, news, movies, etc. Especially unattractive women - there are already plenty of unattractive men. They're probably thinking attractive women will get more viewers, but honestly as a lonely guy who has been rejected by almost every female I've shown interest in, and have had every attractive woman look at me as an undesirable life form, I associate attractive women with sorrow and loneliness, like seeing something you want that you know you can never have. I know that sounds horrible and I certainly do not judge anyone based on looks, but on a very primal level, if they think I am more likely to watch b/c someone is attractive - no, quite the opposite. I don't need to be reminded constantly of the hordes of attractive human beings that are out there that I have no access to. I'd rather focus on what they're saying.
