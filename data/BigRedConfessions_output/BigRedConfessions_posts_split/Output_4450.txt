"Dear ex-boyfriend,
         Since you basically exiled me from your life and forbid me from seeing you, I figured I should let you know a few things. I didn't know how to get back in touch with you, especially since it's only been a few days since our breakup. But I'm going to reveal a few things here for the world to see:
      First, I should let you know: That huge mess you found in your bathroom? THAT WAS ME, BITCH. I was so happy I had to take a massive shit while you were yelling at me and flinging used condoms in my face. Right after we broke up I went to your bathroom and released the aforementioned waste left over from last night's spicy chimichanga and chicken tikka all over your porcelain throne. So happy I didn't even bother sitting down to do so. How did it feel to clean that shit up brah? I made sure the toilet paper stuck to your mirror btw. Make sure you scrub that thing real good haha. Or better yet, just get a completely new one ya big screwball.
      Second, I also stole your secret collection of gangsta-rap/Justin Bieber mixtapes you adore so much. I WILL make this  public knowledge.
      Third, I replaced your marijuana with grass my dog shit on and your pipes with my dildos (which I had to use almost EVERY SINGLE DAY of our 3 month relationship)
      Fourth, Brah what the hell? I've heard of guys collecting panties to show off their sexual exploits. But you actually KEEP your used condoms in a jar. GROSS. And then you had the audacity to fling them at me? What the hell was I thinking when I got with you?!
      Fifth, I will expose you for the lying, cheating, maniacal little twisted fuck you are. I'll make sure that when I'm done, my own dog won't want to copulate with you, you vile piece of trash.
     P.S. I'm telling everyone you banged a prostitute when you were 17 just to lose your virginity.
     P.P.S. I lied. Your peepee is actually pretty small.
     My prediction: Your ONLY girlfriend in the coming years will be your right hand. 

Now you know full well the meaning of the phrase:
""Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned"" 
--(N.B. This phrase is often wrongly attributed to the great playwright, William Shakespeare. In truth, it was not Shakespeare, but another prolific English playwright, William Congreve, who penned this great line)

Your only solace now is the sweet embrace of death, the great equalizer. Enjoy the rest of your meager existence, dog shit.

MUAHAHAHAHA

-Sincerely,
    your CRAZY ex-girlfriend
