I had a friend who graduated. We managed to stay in touch for awhile. I was still in school, and she was unemployed. She constantly complained about how her other Cornell friends all had jobs and lives and had forgotten about her. So who was the one giving her support and encouragement through her job search? Me. But eventually she got a job and a life too, and I was all but forgotten. Upset and confused, I begged to know where she was, and when she finally came back to me, she snapped. What she told me, essentially, was that she no longer had time for me and our friendship was not a priority. I'm starting to think that it never was. What upsets me the most, though, is that she did to me exactly what she complained her own friends did to her. I'm over it now, but it stung. Treat others the way you want to be treated.
