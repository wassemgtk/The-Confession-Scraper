I've only really interacted with you once, and it was super awkward, but it was good because you recognized me from the library and I recognized you too!  Mutual recognition is always cool.  We've only said about ten words to each other, but I think we both know something is there… like we're destined to be friends!  Or more…………………… :D  Who knows.
