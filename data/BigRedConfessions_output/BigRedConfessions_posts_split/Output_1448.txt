I am undocumented. I will also be graduating this May. I am freaking out like crazy as to what I am going to do afterwards. I got friends who are applying, interviewing or have already been accepted. Meanwhile, I am here worrying about the next president, its effects on my status, and what my life will be. I am truly distressed. an internship that I did last summer at another ivy league is not quite worth it; my P.I. hated me. Supervisor was the bomb though.
