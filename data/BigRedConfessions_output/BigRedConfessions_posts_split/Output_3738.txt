I got into a really big fight with my mom during hs because I cried too easily. Ever since then, I stopped crying because I stopped feeling. Now I feel like my heart has really hardened and I don't know how to open it up again. I want to feel again but I'm just always so bitter. Self inflicted pain doesn't seem so absurd to me anymore.
