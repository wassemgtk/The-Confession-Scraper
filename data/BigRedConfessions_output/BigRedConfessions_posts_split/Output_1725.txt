I'm almost 20 years old and my parents call me anywhere from 30-50 times a week. They know that I am really busy here all the time, I really don't have time or energy to spend 45 minutes a day talking to them on the phone, but they won't let up. I try to text them daily and let them know that I'm doing okay, but that's not enough. Even when I do give in and answer, they'll continue to call me throughout the day as if we didn't just have an extensive conversation. I love them to death, but it really stresses me out that they expect me to constantly communicate with them. I'm worried it'll be like this for the rest of my life.
