"Everything about you is telling me that we should say good-bye soon.. I can't imagine how I will make a living with you, knowing what job you are trying to pursue after college. I know it makes more sense for you to never marry and we want two complete opposite things from our lives.

But hey.. Everything inside you--your heart, your mind--makes me think that you might be ""my one."" I just want to go Bruno Mars on you and do this dumb thing called marriage when you graduate. What should I do?"
