So much pain. I can't get over you and I can never have you. It's so hard to imagine ever meeting anyone I will like more than you. And that's completely irrational. I'm in love with an idea of you. I just can't let you go. I wish I'd never met you. I'm so tired of years and years of unrequited love. Human beings aren't supposed to live this way. I'm pretty sure if natural selection was still at work, people like me would be selected out for my own benefit and that of the species. Instead we are all just sitting on this planet and suffering needlessly. Cause a bunch of molecules came together 4 billion years ago and here we are... For what.
