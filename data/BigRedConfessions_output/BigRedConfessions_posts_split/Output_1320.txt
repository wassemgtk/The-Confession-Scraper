You and the original poster both speak as if all opportunities are now for minorities which is entirely untrue. There is a still a great lack of diversity in most STEM fields and the few programs you see are working against that. Most of these programs provide inexpensive experiences that women and students of color would not get simply as a result of structural racism and sexism. You're complaining about an issue that minorities have faced from the beginning time. It seems non-minorities only care about inequality when it affects them, their privilege and their success. The majority of you stay silent when students of color or women in your classroom face racism and sexism on a weekly, if not daily basis.
