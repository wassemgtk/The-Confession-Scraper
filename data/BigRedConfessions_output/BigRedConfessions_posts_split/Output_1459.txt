I want to offer my opinion/rant on TCAT service -- I've seen multiple confessions praising TCAT drivers and explaining how great they are. NOT in my experience. They never show any understanding. They NEVER wait for you, even if they see you running for the bus. On numerous occasions, probably 20+ I've been within 10 feet of the door and they just take off. I'm from NYC and drivers there are much nicer despite having to deal with much crazier ****. In addition to the no waiting, TCAT drivers are rude. I've been yelled at a few times for "improper boarding", i.e. before people have gotten off, and it was only because there was a straggler I didn't see, and I would have backtracked without your yelling. They're always grumpy. They're generally very uptight, and not willing to bend the rules one bit. Technically, they're right, but by no means are they to be praised. It's an expensive and crappy service. The no regular buses after 6 PM is beyond ridiculous. Not the drivers fault, but just another FU to people living farther away. The service should really be free for all Cornell students no matter what. It's a tiny tiny amount compared to tuition anyway. Stanford's bus system is free. I visited a friend there and all transportation was free and much higher quality. TCAT is terrible.
