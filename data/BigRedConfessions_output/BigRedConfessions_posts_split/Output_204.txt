To the girl who thinks that white culture is bigoted and imperialistic: think about who built the amazing infrastructure we use today. The answer is white men like Thomas Edison, Samuel Rea, Cornelius Vanderbilt, Dwight D. Eisenhower, and Alexander Graham Bell. White men are the reason why you have clean water, why you can use the great transportation networks our country and the world has, why you can use a telephone to make calls seamlessly, why you can write letters via the post office to anyone in the US and around the world, and why your drinking water does not have giardia and fecal coliforms.  These great men are my heroes and I look up to them and the past as my inspiration to make America great again. Also think about the beautiful buildings, railroads, and tunnels that were built as a result of these great men. You should pay more homage to these men and this is why we have a Union of White Students at Cornell to celebrate and propagate our great culture. We have people of different backgrounds who come pay homage to our culture. White music culture is also beautiful. I know you probably find rap music and the other losers fascinating, but we prefer Frank Sinatra, Perry Como, or Frankie Avalon, while we have a whiskies on the rocks at our union meetings.
