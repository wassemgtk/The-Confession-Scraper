Skorton's message at the Champagne Toast made me feel really sentimental (never have I felt this way in my life until I realized there are only a few more weeks left in this semester)....I am crying tears of joy, even though I cried a lot because of the stress we go through sometimes at Cornell. I will miss this place so much....Here's to all you underclassmen, enjoy your time at Cornell. I know it may seem really tough sometimes, but just keep pushing and you will reach the finish line just like everyone else...and then you will really miss this place. Believe me, the adventures, the late nights, the everlasting friendships, and all the experiences are all worth reliving. I wish I could go back in time, because I know I will miss all the special concerts and events going on. I feel so envious of the opportunities that will be available for y'all in the future. :) Plus, real life is nowhere as great as Cornell. Go Big Red!!!
