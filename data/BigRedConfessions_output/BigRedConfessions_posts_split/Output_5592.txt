Sometimes, the only thing that's preventing me from killing myself is how much grief it would inflict upon my family. But seriously, though, I just don't want to have to deal with anything anymore sometimes. If there'd be a way to do that without like actually dying, like maybe just a second shot with a new identity in a new city where I don't speak the language -- then I would do it.
