I've never been in a relationship, partly because the opportunity never arose but also partly because I'm afraid. Afraid of potentially losing a great friendship. Afraid of ending up in an unloving marriage like the one my parents are in. They don't hate each other or anything, but I've never once seen them behave in a way a loving couple would. The fact that I've also never seen my aunts and uncles behave like loving couples doesn't help. How do loving couples behave after 30 years of marriage anyway. Does everyone just end up tolerating his or her spouse?
