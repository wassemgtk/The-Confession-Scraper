"From my experience with hook ups, it seems like there are quite a few (frat) guys who don't know how a condom should properly fit. To be fair, the guys I hooked up with were well endowed (7-8 inches), and I know large condoms are expensive and not as easy to attain. But, it was clear that the condoms they used were way too tight for them and it ended up breaking. Twice. On separate occasions this semester.
I'm sorry guys, but the downside of being larger than average is that you have to be more careful about what size condoms you use and this will probably mean dishing out more money for those magnums and magnum XL condoms that will properly fit you. Please don't wait until the condom breaks to realize that the ones you get at Gannett are not the right ones for you. I don't want other girls to have to suffer through the same ordeal that I've recently been through because of your ignorance. This is a serious matter and everyone who is sexually active should be properly educated about proper condom usage. Including girls who also need to be mindful of this potential risk. It's not just the male's responsibility to be informed, ladies."
