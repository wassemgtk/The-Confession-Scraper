While talking about our respective exes, I saw how lit up and animated your face was talking about how awesome your relationship was before you two broke up and came to Cornell. I totally trust you and I know you love me, but it made me feel insecure about our relationship together. I want to believe you when you say you are over your ex and that you haven't spoken with each for a long time.  I worry about you going to your home country during the summer. I wish I could come with you. :-\
