All these people freaking out about finals, and here I am: four tests spread out over all nine days, staying in my pjs all day not leaving my apartment, studying for maybe a couple hours, watching Buffy the Vampire Slayer (towards the end of season 5, for those of you wondering) and reading Storm of Swords (up to Joffrey's wedding). This is going to be a good finals week :)
