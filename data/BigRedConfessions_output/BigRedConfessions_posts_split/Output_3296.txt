Every time I go back to New Jersey, I really think of you and of how well we get along. You take over my mind. Every time. We're just at different stages in our lives, I suppose. Maybe our paths'll line up one day. Maybe we're already heading towards togetherness. I don't know. You should just realize that it's easy to stick with what's easy (obviously), but what's easy isn't always what's best for you.  I really like you, and your linkedin stalking skills. And I think you really like me. I wish I could say this to your face without fear or guilt!  Uggghhhh.
