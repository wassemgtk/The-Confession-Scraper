To the boy on the 3rd floor I met last year: I wish I was brave. I wish I had told you how for some inexplicable reason I felt drawn to you (though I tried not to show it), and by the way you looked at me, I assume you felt a similar draw...or maybe it really was just me. In any case, I wish I would have said something, anything. Not knowing what could have been is awful. It's too late now. I'm sure our paths will never cross again and that's a damn shame.
