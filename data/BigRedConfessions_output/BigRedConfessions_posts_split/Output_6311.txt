My boyfriend raped me when I was 15. A few months later, I was sexually assaulted in the basement of my school and no one would believe me. I don't say this as a pity party. I have healed. It wasn't easy and it still hurts sometimes and has caused many problems for me in my private life, but I have healed.  That being said, I don't believe that it is right to deprive those accused of rape or sexual assault the right to an attorney. If anything, that is what delegitimizes our experiences and our struggles. It's as though we're saying that either we don't have enough proof to get them convicted (which will simply invite claims of false accusation even when a crime was actually committed) or that our struggles put us "above" the law in some way. Everyone who supports depriving them of their right to an attorney screams and begs for equality. How is it equality when they are not even given their basic rights? How would you feel if you were accused of robbing a house and weren't given the right to an attorney? Even if you committed the crime it would suck. Murderers are even given the right to an attorney. Yes rape is an absolutely horrific thing to experience, but you have the opportunity to heal and live and help others do the same. Those who do commit the crime deserve punishment because they have caused extreme pain and suffering for someone, but EVERYONE deserves equal protection under the law. After all, isn't that what we're fighting for?
