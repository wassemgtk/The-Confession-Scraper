One of my worst fears is getting locked-in somewhere without a way of escaping. I got stuck in the Bethe basement last night and it was a nightmare. I thought I could leave the building through the G floor but apparently you can't use any of the exits unless you're a Bethe resident with a Bethe ID and I'm not. Surely that's not legal?? Like, what if there's an emergency? I also set off the door alarm..Bethe staff I'm really sorry about that.
