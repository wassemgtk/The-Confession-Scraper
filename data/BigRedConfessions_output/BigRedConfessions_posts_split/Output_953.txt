I like to assume that anytime I see an asian person wearing a canadian goose jacket, that it's a fake because China is known to produce a lot of lower priced fake products. It sounds racist but I think it's better than having to believe that they're privileged brats who would waste an absorbent of money on an overpriced coat.
