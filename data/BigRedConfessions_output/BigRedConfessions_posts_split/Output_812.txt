I'm starting to realize that i can't be in relationships. i love too deeply for a young age and i am an old soul. i am passionate about art and learning, and kind of sick of tons of parties and heavy drinking. i still have fun going out, but i just feel kinda tired of it. I've really never been about the hookup scene. sometimes, i tend to place so much weight on relationships. i put my heart and soul into them, so when anything goes awry, I'm miserable. I get defensive and I'm sometimes unintentionally mean because i just want things to work so badly and set my expectations too high. I think I've just ruined an amazing relationship over a stupid argument and i wish he could see my side of things, but that isn't quite the case
