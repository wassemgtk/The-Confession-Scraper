I am appalled by the recent protests at Yale, which are calling for professors to resign because of their opinions of cultural appropriation on Halloween. Cultural appropriation is an issue worth discussing, but it's embarrassing that students at a school as prestigious as Yale want to be sheltered from different perspectives. At Cornell, I have learned far more by talking with those I disagree with than by talking to those who share the same views. I hope our student body never becomes so arrogant as to try to silence professors who disagree with us. I am also very relieved that President Garrett spoke about the need to protect freedom of speech at Cornell.
