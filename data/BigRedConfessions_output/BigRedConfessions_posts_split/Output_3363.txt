Recently graduated, but there was a guy who looks like Marcus Samuelsson's identical twin. You were a TA in auto biochem 2 years ago and I came to OH and you helped me out. I can't remember for my dear life what questions I asked you and what the topic was, but I can crystal clear recall your amazing, sexy smile...the kind that lights up the room. It was only five minutes of talking, but I can't forget you. Wish I had the guts to tell you how damn good looking you are. Who are you!!!
