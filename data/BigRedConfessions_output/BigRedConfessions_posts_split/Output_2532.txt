I'm pretty sure that if I wanted someone to tell me how unaccomplished and unattractive I am, all I need to do is put a mirror in front of myself. Yes mother, that's why I have not held a single civil telephone call with you; you're one of the biggest shrews I've ever known, and I would appreciate it if you don't start every telephone call with comments on how much I need to lose weight/cut my hair/try to make myself more attractive. And for whom? Because I'm pretty sure you'd lose your shit if I ever met a guy.
