"I AM SO SCARED. I feel like I might not be able to get an A in one of my classes because I made a stupid mistake (forgetting to turn in one of my assignments on time). I know it's my fault but now I am freaking out!!! I really feel like an A- will still be bad. IT'S A 3.7. It's not that I have never gotten a B before; it's actually the exact opposite. I screwed up in high school and got a lot of Bs. I have things to prove to myself. I am terrified. I AM TERRIFIED. 

I know it will sound pretentious if I tell anyone in person about this, BUT TRUST ME I am actually shaking. I don't think I can continue typing now. HELP."
