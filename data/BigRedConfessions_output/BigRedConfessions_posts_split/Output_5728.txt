"I consider myself to be the ardent hip-hop/rap enthusiast. I happen to be male. Still, I was also irked by Ludacris' comments on ""kidnapping Cornell girls"", ""clean vaginas"", and all that crass sh*t. It was pretty degrading and an awful filler for a performance that, in my opinion, was just okay. By then, the majority of us had already tolerated some lyrics that cut pretty deep to some (it's all about lyrical context vs. context doesn't matter). And, given recent events in Northern Nigeria, a worldwide problem of human trafficking/sex trade, and the stubborn rape culture existent abroad and on home soil, it just wasn't okay.

Anyways, just here to let Cornell women now that there guys out there who have your back. You had the right to feel offended. To put it simply, this just wasn't cool. Some of us were pretty surprised and disgusted too.  Please note that not all of hip-hop/rap artists (mostly men) are as misogynistic - there are some that aren't at all, in fact. Many of the former make plenty of songs that are more inoffensive/acceptable and great to dance to like you don't give a f*ck. Yeah, a hypocritical dichotomy right there. They're merely another product of a larger society/culture that has taught men to think of women in a particular manner. And it's not just hip-hop/rap that is an enabler for this type of mindset - commercials, tv shows, other musical genres, etc. Just see it as another reflection of how men across the aboard need be raised differently. Hopefully, we'll get a better act next year or, at least, we can hold them to some kind code of conduct while at Cornell. "
