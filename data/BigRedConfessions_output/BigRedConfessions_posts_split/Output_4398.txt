I just wanna say fuck you for being a dick to me freshman year. I hope that as a sophomore you can finally make up your mind. 
I guess I was more ready to be together than you were, for that I'm sorry.
I'm completely over you, but I just got re-mad about the whole thing. Damn. I would have been good for you (and you I). But I hope you realize how great of a catch I am. 
And you fucked it up. 
Granted I let you, multiple times. But damn. You missed out on me. I hope you think of me sometimes and think ""fuck. Shouldn't have let her go,"" because you KNOW we were a good match. 

That's disregarding the (poor, poor) sex (if that's what you want to call it) we had right before you broke it off (again). 
And you don't even have the decency to text me back? To be friends? Fuck you, man. Fuck you. 

Also fuck you for ruining RHCP and Zep for me. t(-.-t)
