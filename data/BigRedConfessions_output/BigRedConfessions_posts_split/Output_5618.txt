My friend just told me they hope I get something to go in my favor next semester because from the looks of things, I've had a suckish semester. I laughed and said yeah, wouldn't that be nice. But then went to my room and cried because they're right. Nothing's gone my way this year at all. I'm not unhappy, but i wish I felt better than I do.
