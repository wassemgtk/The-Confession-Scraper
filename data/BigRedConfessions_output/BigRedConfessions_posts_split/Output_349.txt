This is regarding the equal representation debate on the CS page. 

Last week, an entire group of us, men, women, guys, girls, of all color, got called bigots for not recognizing the inequality shown in the CS cover page. As a woman, at first I was like, yeah go girls. And then I realized how ridiculous the post was. I don't want women to be represented just because they are underrepresented, I was us to earn our place there as one of the top 5 loved professors in the CS department at Cornell. 

I'm very frustrated because while women here fight for feminism or any type of equality, they continue to support Greek life, one of the most sexist modern day institutions in America. 

If we women can't separate ourselves from double standards, how can we expect men to do the same?
