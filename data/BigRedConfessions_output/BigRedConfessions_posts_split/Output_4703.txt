This is a serious question that has been confusing me for a while, and I do need an answer. Why are there people being insulting on or near campus, sometimes shouting dirty words to random people walking by? I do not care whether they are drunk because no matter what, this is of no good. Is it because Cornell is not selective enough so that immature people who don't understand respect and politeness get in? Admission process doesn't care about this at all? School admin doesn't see scenes like this? What are these insulting kids doing and thinking about? This literally ruins my college experience, and I never truly enjoy any weekend nights because I'm afraid of running into people behaving this way.
