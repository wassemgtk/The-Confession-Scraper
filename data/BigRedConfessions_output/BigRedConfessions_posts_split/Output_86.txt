What a day... I woke up, didn't get out of bed for 2 hours, then masturbated 7 times, ordered food because I didn't want to go outside, didn't shower, watched random stuff on youtube, and now I'm going to bed, and I'm not even going to brush my teeth. I feel god awful. This has been the worst day. Idleness is supposed to make you happy but I am really exhausted and sad.
