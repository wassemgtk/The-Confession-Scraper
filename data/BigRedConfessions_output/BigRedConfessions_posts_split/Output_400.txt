"Sometimes I get really pissed off by my roommate's whining. She always says stuff like ""ugh got two prelims next week feel like I'm gonna drop dead"" or ""so much homework figure I should just kill myself lol jk.""
Seriously, you need to stop saying that. What do you know about the panic and emptiness when suicidal thought creeps up your spine and you are utterly helpless against it? What do you know about the depression that keep surfacing despite your best effort at suppressing it and faking normal? What do you know about the flashback of memories of those dark days when your friends ask about the suspicious scars on your wrist and you have to stretch your full imagination at that instant to come up with a plausible story? 
No. You don't know nothing. So shut the fuck up and do your works like a responsible human being. Thank you very much."
