I know we're just friends. Good friends, actually. But sometimes you do things that make me think, "does he like me? Or is this just how he is?" It's just hard to know what your intentions are since you're a fairly shy guy when it comes to this stuff. I used to have the biggest crush on you when we first met, and I think it might be coming back.. I just hope I'm not reading too much into things. I'm trying to be skeptic and not get too excited, but I'll probably end up being a hopeless romantic anyways
