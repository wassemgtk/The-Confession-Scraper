I'm a girl. And a virgin. I've had a few hookups and a few guys have wanted to have sex but I couldn't because of the whole "I'm waiting for a nice boyfriend to lose it to" idea. I promised myself that thinking I'd lose it in college but I never realized how fucking hard it is to get into a relationship here.
