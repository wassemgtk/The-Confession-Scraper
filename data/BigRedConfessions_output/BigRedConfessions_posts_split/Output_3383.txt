OK, so this is kind of long and wierd but here goes.

I met my girlfriend a year ago via the internet.  We mostly just chatted for a while, like she was one of my friends here.  Then I decided to take a leap of other faith and we exchanged contact information, got in touch on Facebook, everything.  And through it all, I slowly fell in love.  Asked her if she felt the same, she said yes, yay! But she's several states away, boo.  We text and call, even Skype every day, but I still miss her. I want to hold her and kiss her and love her in person. So I applied to a bunch of internships in her home city, but I haven't heard from any of them.  Saying no is one thing - I can live with rejection and bad luck.  But this silence... Every day that goes by without any news just breaks my heart a little bit more.  I hate that I need her so much.  It's painful when the only way I can see her is through a screen.  But I'm doing my best to turn that pain into motivation, that if I work hard and pray (I'm not even religious) I might have my wish granted. 

I haven't told anyone about her yet. My parents are already worried I'm becoming a bit of a recluse (though I do my fair share of getting out) and I have no idea how to explain it to anyone.  I feel bad for that, actually.  They deserve to know, and she's a wonderful person, but I'm worried they won't like her or something.  I have no idea what to say, but I really want to say something.

So instead of that, Im hiding behind anonymity and getting the main things of my chest.  If you guys read through all thus, one, wow you have patience and two, thanks, sincerely.  It's nice to have someone listen
