When I first came to Cornell I never imagined I would join a sorority. I thought it was stupid, shallow, and elitist. I never drank in H.S., and never saw myself as the type to party or engage in the hook up culture. What I didn't realize, though, is how much those stereotypes don't hold true and how I would really come to value being involved in huge community at Cornell. I know that there exists so much tension at our school between Greeks and non-Greeks, but sometimes I wonder if it has to be that way. I acknowledge the valid reasons that the Greek system can represent a lot of harmful aspects of our society. I know the Greek system tends to be a hierarchy that is too obsessed with wealth, appearances, alcohol/drugs, and high-risk sex and how it tends to be noninclusive of minorities, lower socioeconomic groups, and LGBTQ peers. I know. These issues deeply affect me and force me to question my involvement with the Greek system. But, every time I think deeply enough about my involvement I remember all the people I've met in frats and sororities at Cornell who also care a lot about these issues, feel the same way animosity towards the culture, and recognize it's need for reform. I've met so many people who not only recognize these issues but belong to inclusive houses on this campus that don't represent those stereotypes. My experience in my sorority has been utterly invaluable to me because of the great people I've met and how much it's allowed me to connect with people on this campus who are both in and out of the Greek system. Not to mention how much fun it is. Honestly, it's such a huge community that it's really one of the best parts of such a depressing and isolating school like Cornell. Sometimes I wish more people would be open-minded about the Greek system so that we can begin reforming it from the inside. But maybe I'm just an idealist.
