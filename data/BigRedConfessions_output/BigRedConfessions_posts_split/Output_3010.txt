I get really sad when I think about how every time I talk to my mom, it's never about, or never can be about my feelings, or emotions in general. It's always about "progress" or whether I'm doing A, B, and C here at Cornell to get to points D, E, F, etc... the "right way".  If I don't answer her questions the way she wants them to be answered I get shamed for it. One of the things I dread most is going home for breaks because I have to live inside the little cardboard box that is the four walls inside my head.  I tremble and shake in disgust and fear in my own home. 
Never mind being creative, never mind having a heart and soul along with this brain of mine. All of these are moot points for her--that's even an understatement.

If I am not hitting the gym everyday at precisely 8am, skipped a session in the pool, or had to change up the way I do things-or sometimes sacrifice things like sleep and exercise for my schoolwork and work responsibilities, I get shamed for it. I get held to ridiculous standards, get ugly looks and comments in place of supportive, understanding smiles or hugs.  
I can only be so self-absorbed and selfish as to spend all of my time thinking about the "right ways" and about me me me and how I'm supposed to have the mentality that I'm the best thing to roam the earth and that I should pursue nothing but what will be most "socially acceptable": the best paying job, the most good looking man (of the "correct race/ethnicity" and social class" according to her), and all of the "guaranteed" riches that are supposed to come from seeking these things.

Well I'd like to just say that I'm tired of this stranglehold being placed on my life. It hasn't ever been my own, but I'm ready to take complete and full ownership of it now. It has taken me a little over two full years at Cornell to realize this. I am so happy with where I've come so far--paving my life as my own. I'm so happy with my new major and my mission to continue my education and hopefully land a decent job and spread some good knowledge--at any university in the future. I'm so happy with who I am in a relationship with currently-someone who, while he may not fit the "standards" she has set, goes above and beyond any prior expectation I've had of a significant other-someone I can see myself being with a few years down the road- circumstances willing-someone who does value me for exactly what I want and will care for me if I need to be taken care of. 

But nothing, absolutely nothing I say or do can convince her that my life is headed in the right direction. 

I shouldn't feel at all guilty for wanting to distance myself, right? Can someone please verify that the very person who raised me is ultimate provider of toxicity in my life? 
Can someone please tell me that it's okay to feel this way and that I have a right to live my own way without carrying the weight of "disappointing or abandoning" her on my shoulders every day? 
I just need some reassurance-the kind I'm not used to getting.
