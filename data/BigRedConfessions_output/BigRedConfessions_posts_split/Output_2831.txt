"I felt completely naked discussing something that seemingly defines me, in one dimension, but regardless a large part of myself.

I try to distance myself from facing what it means to have the grades that I got. If I care too much about it, I know I will break. It'll snap me inside more than I can handle - I know that. I can feel the tears about to burst and stream down my cheeks as I am writing this...
I think it's because I either cared too much or didn't care at all. Never really in between. 

This weird in between feeling is irritating...
I feel like it's because I don't have a clear defined goal in mind. This is important, more than anything, because it'll eventually define what I learn, why I study, who I meet, what I value, and really...everything. But without this, I'm completely lost and powerless. I feel powerless. Worthless. Useless. 
I'm doing things that don't matter. That doesn't add any substance to me. But I do it anyways as a way to compensate for the empty feeling I get - academically and socially. Does this paint an accurate picture of myself? 

I haven't said anything. I haven't told anyone. I feel like I need to let someone know, because I don't think I can keep up with a straight face without someone knowing. I don't know how or who to reach out to...

I'm not a freshman. No. Wish I were actually. Maybe that would have changed things. If I were to have different experiences, joined greek organizations, tried out for a club sports, I don't know, reached out more...I know I have the potential, but now I've missed the opportunities. 

This is definitely not THE most worrisome issue. It's not going to kill me or anything. But when this started to define my boundaries, my mindset and eventually control my life, I felt like they were clear signs to reach out. I hope this isn't wasting anyone's time. Because that's essentially what everyone is out of. Time.   

I don't know why I felt compelled to justify all this. I don't know what I don't know or what I do know, as a matter of fact. 

Who do I confide in?? I don't want to pressure someone, but I don't want someone to think any less of me. or judge me based on that. Because I know I would.
