Sometimes I think things are working out for me. But most of the times, I still hate myself. I find out through random occurrences that I am just too goddamn stupid to live. And most days, this knowledge and self -pity makes me a huge lump that just sits around and does nothing useful or creative or industrious or productive. Only when a deadline gets uncomfortably close, I panic and actually stop wasting time and then race to get shit done, thus doing them half-assedly. It's a damn miracle that I graduated. I still can't believe it. But now it's real world time. I'm just praying I don't get fired on day one!
