I shy away from relationships because my culture doesn't necessarily allow dating and my parents are insanely strict. I'm sure I could convince them to understand, especially if the guy were a respectful and decent human being, but I don't want to put any kind of pressure on a person to have to deal with the mess that is my family and my personal life. So I put out a cold shoulder.
