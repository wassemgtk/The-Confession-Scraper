I love Cornell. Coming here was the best decision ever made. And I love the United States. People always complain how America has the worst highway infrastructure and the worst roads in the developed world. Well as an immigrant, let tell you they are orders of magnitude better than where I grew up -- my most salient memory from growing up in the third world was taking the bus to middle school. I would put my backpack on my lap, cause there was nowhere else to put it on those crammed buses, the road would be riddled with potholes and the bus would have zero suspension, so my backpack would just bounce crazily on my lap and give me the most insane boners and then when we got to the school I would have to figure out how to hide the huge tent I had pitched. And those boners would not go away. Regular boners would go away pretty quickly. Bus boners would stick around. That's why we should invest in a better infrastructure.
