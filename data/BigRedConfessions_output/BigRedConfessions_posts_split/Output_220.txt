I understand why the 1/3rd of America who is functionally illiterate/braindead/sheep is for Trump. But I have started to encounter intelligent people who support him. Yes, I am talking about your fellow Cornellians. What the heck is happening to our best campuses and to our country? What is going on in your brain that you think electing this guy is a good idea? In every single way imaginable he is the worst possible candidate/human being. What is going on here? The American experiment can't end this way after 240 years. We cannot elect a fascist. I am terrified.
