If my experience with scientific research as an undergraduate at Cornell could be described with one word, it would be disillusioning.  I arrived as a freshman thinking I was talented, experienced, dedicated, innovative, and all those attributes that make a good scientist.  I thought my lab experience would enable me to work with faculty to engage in significant research in the field of my interest.  Yet, I realize now that in the eyes of the research faculty here, I am really just a nobody.  I am just an undeserving undergraduate and a pesky premed.  With the exception of one researcher whose lab is no longer operating, no professor would even give me a chance to show just how passionate I am about science.  Yet, there is nobody to blame but myself.  Maybe in comparison to other undergraduates here my research experience is insignificant.  Maybe I am bad at interviewing and cannot impress any researcher.  Maybe I am too impatient to effectively utilize the office of undergraduate research.  Maybe I should have went to a lower tier university where my skills and experience would stand out and I would actually get a chance.
