Sometimes I feel that I MUST be broken, "out of alignment" or my sights are inherently flawed. I find that every woman I find date worthy or genuinely interesting at Cornell always falls into these two categories. #1: "I have a boyfriend" or #2: "I just broke up with my boyfriend and I'm still not over him." I have yet to find someone who falls into third category #3: "Yes, I'm single and I'd like to get to know you more". 

Am I looking in all the wrong places? Am I being too impatient? Are my standards to high? Am I too "nice"? Am I simply not good enough? Am I being lied to? I don't know the answers to these questions, but I do know this: being single when you're trying not to simply sucks.
