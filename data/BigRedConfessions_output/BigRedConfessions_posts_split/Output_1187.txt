I have a legitimate question. I don't want to offend anybody, I am just honestly confused. First off, I am a white male. I know that minorities face many challenges that I can not even understand. However, I am unsure of how I can best support and help reduce those challenges and create a more inclusive society. I have been told off for not doing xyz (posting in solidarity on FB, attending demonstrations, etc), but I have also been told off for doing those things ("you can't understand what we face, don't pretend you can" etc). What is the best why I can help? Even the recent issue with the Black Students United at Cornell. They don't want a scheduled protest to occur because of the "lack of people of color" involve in the planning. On one hand, I understand that, but at the same time I don't. What do they want the "majority" to do? participate? or stand back? or occupy some middle ground of copious FB posts in empathy but no actually action. I really want to help support my fellow Cornellians and fellow human beings around the world, I just don't know how without offending anybody.
