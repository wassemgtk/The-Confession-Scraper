I'm in a new long distance relationship with an incredible girl, and I always feel bad because I'm so busy that we don't get to Skype as often as I like (though we still manage to while I do homework for a couple hours each day). Especially since in my last relationship, my girlfriend was always so busy and it hurt me because it felt like she didn't want to make time for me. I don't want to do the same thing to my new girlfriend, but I have to get my work done sometime. Challenges of an LDR :(
