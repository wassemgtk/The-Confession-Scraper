You are so frustrating. Emotions were never supposed to be part of this, but we're both human, and all else aside, we're connected now. I'm so intrigued by you, and worried about who you're going to be for the rest of your life. I know there's no changing people, but damn. I choose to believe you act like an asshole because you have so many walls up and that's your way of dealing with everything, and I'm terrified to find out that I'm wrong. I'm terrified that you really are an asshole, and that underneath, the good person I want to find simply isn't there, or at least, won't surface for me. You have so much pride, but so do I. Is that what this is going to come down to? A battle for pride? Because if that's how it happens, we both lose. We have the opportunity to be there for each other, but we're both also constantly pulling away just as we get close. There has been such a lack of communication, and miscommunication every time we do talk. Can we sit down and figure this out? That's the next step, I think. I want you to trust me. And if you can't, I need to know, because I deserve better than this.
