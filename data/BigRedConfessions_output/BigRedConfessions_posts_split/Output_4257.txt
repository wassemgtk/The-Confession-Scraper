I feel like when we were first about to become friends we both ended up joining an organization that took up a ton of time. So talking to you and contacting you was easy because we could always bring up the work we were doing and I thought it was fun and that we were friends. But things have slowed down and when I should have been happy I was just super depressed because I feared we'd just fall out of touch until the club picked up again. And we did... And I miss you... So maybe text me if you wanna grab dinner? And we could work towards being actual friends.
