1 year, 2 months, 3 days. I've never been so alone since graduation. I know, I deserve it. And that's that. I'm finally independent like I've always wanted and yet I've imagined our conversation and you coming back so many times. Over and over and over. I have so much to say to you and yet, nothing really at all. 

This past year I've become you. I laugh and joke and smile at work. I make up stories. Somehow, maybe because I stopped caring, I've become popular, people like me and respect me. I'm on track for an excellent rating. But when I leave the office, I go home and just sit there. Staring at a wall. It's just empty. I'm hollow. Know one knows me, I don't even know me. But you knew me.
