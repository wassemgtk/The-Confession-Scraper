"Do all college guys just want sex? I am trying to move on from a really beautiful, loving long term relationship with someone from high school, but I can't seem to do that because on date 3 they're always expecting me to spend the night or have sex. I'm not a prude-I love kissing and I even love having sex...but I don't like being pressured or expected to do something that I may not be comfortable with, with someone who i barely know.
