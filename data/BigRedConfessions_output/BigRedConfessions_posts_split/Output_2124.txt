As graduation comes closer and closer, I feel the need to let this out somewhere. I definitely won't do it publicly, since I don't need my friends to see me get all emotional and stuff.

I cannot goddamn wait to be rid of this place.

Now, I'm not trying to make a "Cornell bad" statement. I'm 100% cognizant of differences in experiences between individuals. Also, I would be remiss not to mention the positives of my experience. I've made many friends, probably close to quadrupled my intelligence, and I've managed to do things I could have scarcely imagined before attending this school.

That said, whatever I was coming into this school no longer exists. The idealistic person who wanted to change the world is gone, his dreams replaced by a dark cloud that doesn't seem to ever go away. I thought it was tied to the weather, but I find myself exhausted and unhappy even in the bright summer months. Even on the precipice of graduation, I can feel the presence of this cloud.

Semesters tend to start off well; I attend classes, do reasonably well on exams, etc. Then the stretch of the semester after October break, or after February break, begins and everything starts getting miserable. I sleep in and make small sacrifices to my grade that turn bigger and bigger. They say insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results; by that definition my time here has been pretty much off the charts crazy.

In my department, I am somewhat known as "that kid who stops showing up to class." My professors are aware of some personal issues I've had to deal with, so at the very least they don't hate me. That's all I can ask for.

My GPA has suffered. I am aware that this is my fault, largely blamable on constantly turning in assignments late and a lack of class participation. Even so, my four years at this school are represented by a number that only causes me embarrassment. This number may not follow me everywhere, but that doesn't change the fact that it exists, and will always exist somewhere in the files kept by the university. The academic record I was so proud of before college is now irreparably tarnished.

Despite this, I begrudgingly know I'm much better off now than I was four years ago. I have significant non-class-related achievements, and I have proved my knowledge of my coursework in other ways. Companies seem to have taken notice. I am jumping off a burning ship, but at least I learned how to swim.

So, Cornell, I simultaneously thank and curse you. I curse you for making me feel like shit, but I thank you for breaking me down and letting me build myself back up. I am not the same, but what I am now may serve me well in the future. And who knows. Maybe with time, that idealistic glint will return to my eyes.
