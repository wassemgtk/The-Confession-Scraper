I feel bad not really being chatty with bored taxi drivers and shutting down their attempts at communication (I'm a guy so its not like they are flirting, they are bored), b/c I know exactly what it's like to want to make a connection with another human being, but on the other hand... It's not like we'll hang out or see each other again, plus you're not really my friend type .....
