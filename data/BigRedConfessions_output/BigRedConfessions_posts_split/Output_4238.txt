Tonight for the first time, suicide seriously crossed my path for the first time ever. I was completely sober, my social/financial/physical situation is completely normal.  Yet for some reason I couldn't help not wanting to exist anymore. While I realize it's extremely selfish and completely a "waste of a human being" thought, I still briefly felt unwanting of a life.  I've made so many friends at Cornell but all of my relationships seems superficial, either I feel like they use me for money/kindness, or I feel like they dislike me as a person but put up with me for convenience. I'm by no means attractive, but I've set my standard to high and will never be able to have a relationship because I refuse to date anyone who isn't completely out of my league,  I've been rejected from everything ive applied to (excluding Cornell). These problems are all temporary and simply superficial and incomparable to someone who suffers from chronic starvation or paralysis,  etc. But in my twisted mind, it warrants me to no longer want this life. I don't know where I'll end up after death, but I'd honestly rather not exist than exist in this world.
