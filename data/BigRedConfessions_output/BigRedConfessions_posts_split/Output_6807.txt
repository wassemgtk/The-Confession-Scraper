"I'm really concerned about subletting for Spring 2015, but I think some nice folks reading this might help me out

I am going abroad in Spring 2015, and would like to sublease the housing. It's quite inexpensive ($535/mo), in Collegetown (717 E. Buffalo). Please help me find someone who'd take it starting January (puppy face) :)"
