I'm a freshman. I'm a super awkward person and new people intimidate me especially at parties so i haven't made many friends here so far. I've never kissed a girl or even been in a relationship so I keep telling myself that one will come my way, but my anxiety and self consciousness prevents me from talking to anyone. I'm terrified I'm going to end up super depressed in the next four years and I don't want that to happen.
