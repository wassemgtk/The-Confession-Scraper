i hate my life and i hate cornell so much. no one could have more hatred. everyone who knows me knows that i'm depressed, but i'm sure they're all a little happier because they think that i somehow have gotten over my anxiety. no, i'm so depressed i can hardly move or get out of bed. i'm so worried that this place ruined my life and even upon leaving here i will have had my chances at life taken away from me
