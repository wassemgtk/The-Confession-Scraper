"2.5 years
2.5 years and every one of the relatively small number of times we argued and fought, I tried to make sure you were satisfied with the outcome. That both of us knew what we had to do to get better. Im sorry I ever made u feel bad, because it meant the world to me to make u happy. I tried so hard to even change myself. I begged you to have patience. We had a fucking plan. We were happy..

2.5 years, and one night doesn't go right and you throw everything at my face. You go in 3 hours from ""I'm getting ready for our date"" to Texting me ""Wer over. Sure, it's not you, it's me"" I did the one thing u directly asked me to do. A couple of other things too. And you made fun of it. And if I was as daring as to point that out, you stormed off.

I count 7 reasons you spat at my face that night why we couldn't be together. 7 reasons u recited with cold hearted emotionless brutality. And each and every one of them were a mixture of extreme long-term and ""Are you realizing this just now??"" The fact that we were nice people who loved each other was enough for me..

You gave me hope. You gave me happiness. You gave me love. And then u snatched it all away. Because you had lied to yourself and to me about how you truly felt. 

If you're reading this, I want you to know how I feel. Hurt, angry, betrayed doesn't begin to cover it. I want to inspire one single tear of actual caring in you, cause heaven alone knows there wasn't any that night. The night you ripped my heart out.

As for me.. Im hoping this is catharsis. That if I convince myself that u did care, and you do hurt, thatl itl be easier to move on.."
