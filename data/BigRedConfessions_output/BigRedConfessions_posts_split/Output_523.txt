I get euphoric feelings when I take a train at 100-150mph on the Northeast Corridor flying past major population centers from Boston to DC, while sucking mostly Pennsylvania generated electricity from the catenary wires. Whoever was from NJ and wrote that post 75 mph is nothing, you should try the Acela one time and know that Pennsylvania beats your need for speed!
