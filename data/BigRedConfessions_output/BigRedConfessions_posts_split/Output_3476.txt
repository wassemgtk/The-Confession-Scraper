I just turned down a six figure salary to make nearly 3 times less working for the government. Why? Because I believe in public service. I know this looks like bragging/guilt tripping/pointing out how much better I am than other people, etc. But let's remember that 1) This is anonymous, and 2) I just said no to $100K a year, because I believe in an idea, so I think I deserve a selfish moment of feeling good about myself in front of people, if only for a few seconds. Do what you love. Do what you believe in. Stuff won't bring you happiness.
