I'm the OP of #5691

Anyone that knows me will know I'm the one to write these posts, but it was eating me up inside. Thank you all for liking the post and for the comments. I've tried to talk to people about this but "sexual assault" just shuts people up. It's hard to try to talk to someone about how it bothers me, knowing that he got off scot-free and that I am unable to change anything. It's even harder being brushed off by the first 30 people I tried talking to about it.
