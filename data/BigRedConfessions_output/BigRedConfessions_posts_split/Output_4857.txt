"I want you to love me all the time, or not at all. 

I want to know how you really feel. I want to know what you want. I want to feel like I have a grip on myself around you. Because every time I'm sure I can end it because you don't really care about me, you look at me like I'm the most beautiful person in the world and I can't.
