Liberals throw science out the window when they claim that Caitlyn Jenner is a woman. He has Y chromosomes and is therefore a man, plain and simple. Just because he has a mental illness that compelled him to mutilate his genitals doesn't change the undeniable fact that he is indeed a man. For every other mental illness, we treat the victim. If someone has dyslexia, we never contend that the words that he/she sees are somehow the problem; we recognize that we must treat the person's condition so that he/she is able to see words normally. When it comes to gender identity disorder, we accept the disorder and modify the human's gender (although genetically the person's sex remains the same) in order to treat the disorder, which is completely absurd.
