"Obnoxious prudes" confession here. Some (but only some) people who hook up infuriate us too, as much as we probably infuriate you. Here's how we really feel about you. We don't have special someones in our lives either, we flirt with other people too, and most of us probably don't judge much for the fact that you have one night stands. BUT we do judge you for being a dependent, emotional mess about not having a special someone, being irresponsible and having to get morning after pills all the time, drunk dialing us and expecting us to come save you from whatever frat you are at, and then freaking all your friends out when you decide to drown your love life sorrows in alcohol/drugs just because he told all his friends/hasn't texted back... and once we have nursed your bruised ego from rejection and loneliness, YOU DO IT ALL AGAIN. Did I mention that you think we are obnoxious, prudish, boring? Who's judging who? 

You make our lives complicated and take us for granted.
