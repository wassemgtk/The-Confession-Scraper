I came to Cornell thinking straight about what I'd do, but instead, my courses were nothing like what I wanted to do. My GPA sucked and I barely managed to graduate. I made a mistake, I should have switched majors, but couldn't. 

In April, I lost the love of my life, because she lost feelings for me. Like having professional problems wasn't enough, my personal life also got fucked. Am a firm believer in falling in love once, and growing old with that person till death do us part. But clearly, it's too easy to lose feelings these days I guess. I guess having best friends who lost feelings for their better halves rubbed on to my love too. I still talk to my love and cry to sleep daily. God I wish I could just be there or turn back time, I'd have never left their side.

After a terrible GPA, being international and brown just added to my problems because only ""privileged"" people born here or citizens of this country have it easy. Also, I am not in software or electronics, so west coast was out. I struggled to find a job. When I did, I started working and currently, I hate my mentor and I hate the job. I am a fucking engineer, born to make things, but being an international student, trying to keep my job, visa status and all that jazz, I am curbing my talent as an engineer. So much for this country being the land of opportunities. More like land of opportunities for those who came years back or are privileged to be citizens. For people like me, who made a mistake, who have talents that go way beyond my resume and soft skills, this country is really shallow. I need to have a ""network"". I need to be a smooth talker. Bloody hell, sponsorship for visa is a fucking criteria to get a rejection from a company that needs people like me. 

When did a country made from immigrants, that created such technological advances with the help of immigrants, become so xenophobic? Why are international students don't given the same freedom to do what their passion is instead of sticking to a god damn degree? 

I wish this year changes things for the better. I hope I am able to move on or get back with my ex who I love dearly. If it wasn't for my friends around, I'd have broken beyond repair. Luckily, they keep me occupied with crap which makes me feel better. I love you guys, way too much :*
