Today at lunch I saw a painfully thin girl slowly eating a bowl of fruit. She was sitting alone and kept feeling her stomach between bites. I know it could be a hundred reasons and I don't want to jump to conclusions. But as somebody who used to have an eating disorder (and had to take a term off school to go to a facility), I couldn't help but notice. It brought me back to everything I faced. I feel so helpless and so sad knowing she is probably struggling. I know what it is like to be trapped in that hole and it is horrible.
