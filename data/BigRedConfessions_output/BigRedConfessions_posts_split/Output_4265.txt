I'm a senior and I'm so lonely I can't stand it. My support system is nonexistent anymore, my family needs my support, and I've always been the high functioning member of the family so they've never been any support for me, only a drain (not that they can help it). For the years while I was here I made friends but the majority of them graduated last year (I started class of 2014). The friends I have left are more like acquaintances, coworkers... I can't talk to them any more... and when I do it definitely can't be about things that are bothering me because they all have their own fucked up lives and don't have time for mine... I've tried so hard to be a thoughtful caring person, and in the end, what's left? No one acknowledges when I do something for them, but god forbid I lose my temper or say something harsh. No one wants to actually know me, they only want me around when I'm doing things for them and they never reciprocate... and in the end, I have no one.
