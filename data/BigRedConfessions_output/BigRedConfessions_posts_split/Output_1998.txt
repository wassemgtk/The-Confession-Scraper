I'm honestly so sick of how the "body-positive" movement has morphed into a fat acceptance movement. You should absolutely never shame someone for their appearance or make them feel inferior for not meeting some arbitrary cultural beauty standard. The media perpetuates an impossible ideal that is damaging to the self-esteem of our young women (and older women!) and has a hundred other negative consequences and it's terrible. I get that. But so many people I see as part of this movement are literally obese. There is a line between accepting and celebrating a wide range of natural body types and condoning or supporting an unhealthy condition (yes, obesity is a disease and it's epidemic in the US).

But then I hear people who share my opinion going off in the other direction, saying it's okay to tell smokers not to smoke, why can't we tell obese people the same? Fuck that. Full disclosure, I'm a smoker. I KNOW it's horrible, I've seen all the public service announcements that you have. I've tried to quit multiple times and I'm still fucking working on it. If a close friend wants to express concern to me that's fine, but people seem to feel free to call me out all the goddamn time. No. You do not get to do that, let's all learn some basic politeness and leave people alone. 

tl;dr Don't condone unhealthy lifestyles (lung cancer isn't beautiful, neither is obesity), but don't be a gaping asshole to people.
