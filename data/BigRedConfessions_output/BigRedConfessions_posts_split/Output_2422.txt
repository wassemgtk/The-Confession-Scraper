Yo, to the guy I basically stood next to for the entire modest mouse concert:  You's a cutie. I'm a cutie. You're tall, I'm tall (I think you heard me comment about tallness in that crowd). You like modest mouse, I like modest mouse. I think it's meant to be.  I hope you're a Cornellian and maybe I'll see you around, or maybe you'll even comment. Hmu.
