I'm sorry I ditched you today. I woke up at 3 PM, sulked for a few hours, and then wrote this confession. That was my whole day and that's all I can will myself to do sometimes. You really don't have to understand and condone this behavior, I barely do. But believe it or not, I really do appreciate you as a really great friend that I love spending time with in spite of all of this. And as soon as I figure out how not to be like this, if you're still around, I'll make up for it anyway I can.
