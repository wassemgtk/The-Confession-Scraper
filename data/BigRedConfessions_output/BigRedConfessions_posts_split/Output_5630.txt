"im going to be working in tokyo for the summer...and now i'm starting to delve into all the radiation scare stuff, and how the japanese gv't tells nothing but lies. just started to wonder whether all the smart kids didn't apply bc they didn't want to die and that's how i got the job...

...so this is how natural selection works huh. fuck, i want this job but i don't want to die."
