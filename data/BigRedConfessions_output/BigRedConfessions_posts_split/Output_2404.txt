Now that I am no longer under your spell, I am so happy that we are not together anymore. When you left me I thought it was the worst thing to ever happen to me, but I recently realized that it was probably the best thing for me. Our relationship was bringing me down and bringing me pain. Now I am as confident as ever and very excited about my future. It's so strange but I feel nothing for you when I see you. I don't care if we never speak again. I don't care if you start dating someone else. I see you for who you are now, and that's why I'm able to move on. I know that you will regret leaving me. You probably do already. But I'm happy to say that I don't need you or want you anymore.
