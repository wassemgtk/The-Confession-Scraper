"When guys here lament at being stuck with a friendship, some girls here (and in general) are quick to get defensive and all, ""What's wrong with her friendship blah blah?"" I'm sorry, but I find this hypocritical. You don't owe him anything, why does he owe you something? So, using myself as an example, and because I'm bored on spring break, I'm going to tell you what's wrong with her friendship. Keep mind, this actually applies to both sexes (although guys are the ones more traditionally ""friendzoned""):

1) It's not what I what I was looking for. If you open up a present on Christmas, and you get a android instead of an iPhone, you're going to be disappointed. In fact, let's say you really wanted an android instead of an iPhone, and you get a iPhone, you're going to be disappointed. There's nothing inherently wrong with an iPhone (or an android), but if it's not what you're looking for, disappointment is natural. There's nothing inherently wrong with your friendship, but it's not what I was looking for.

2) I have plenty of friends. At any given time, I have dozens, if not hundreds, of friends that I barely have the time for and already don't know what to do with, so having another friend...well...who cares? It's like buying Pokemon cards, looking for a holographic Charizard, and all you get are Pidgeys; and then some jerk comes along with a Charizard, and you're like ""Yo lemme get that Charizard?!"" And they're like, ""Nah....Tell you what doe...how about I give you this Pidgey?"" So you're like ""motherfucker, I already got Pidgey's out the ass. I don't need anymore. Just forget it."" And then the guy's like, ""WHAT'S WRONG WITH MY PIDGEY?"" 

3) You ever wave a steak in front of a lion? Because that's what being friends with someone you like feels like, both sexually and emotionally. Maybe a guy (or girl) doesn't feel like subjecting himself to that kind of torture, and that's a personal, respectable choice.

4) You're not what I'm looking for in a friend. Just because you're what I was looking for in a partner, does not mean you're what I was looking for in a friend. Have you ever stopped to think that you're simply not friend material? I mean, it makes sense right? You friended the guy because he's not dating material, but you did see him fit as a friend material, so clearly there's a difference between the two. The guy just flipped it and used it the other way around, and that's perfectly fine.

So there you have it--four explanations for what's wrong with your friendship. Ultimately, I think if both parties understood each other, there would be a lot less bitching going around. Guys, she doesn't owe you a date, so if she friends you, don't bitch about it, or think less of her. Girls, he doesn't owe you a friendship, so if he doesn't want to be friends, don't bitch about it, or think less of him. There are perfectly valid and respectable reasons for both sides to go about their business how they see fit."
