The difference between "aww that is so sweet" and "ew, what a creep" in the context of liking a girl is essentially negligible. I don't know of any other phenomenon or event in the universe for which the line is blurred between 2 absolute extremes. There is no middle ground either, it's one or the other. There is no universal standard or way to measure which category a situation falls in either, it is entirely subjective and then opinions snowball into one direction or the other. And we all have to roll the dice and risk falling into the negative category and then suffering the consequences if we don't want to die alone.
