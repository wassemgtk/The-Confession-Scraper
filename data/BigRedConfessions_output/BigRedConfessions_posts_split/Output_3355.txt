Being a freshman in the black community has been so frustrating. Everyone claims to be supportive of each other and we continually talk about how we look out for each other when we don't. Freshman cliques are already set and there so hard to get into. Sometimes I walk into an event and people stare at me like I'm stupid. There are some people in the community that when I smile or say hi to (and I know they don't know me) they look at me like I'm stupid. It's hard being here as a minority and it's sad that can't even find comfort in my on community.
