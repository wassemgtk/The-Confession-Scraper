I wish the guy from big red raas would notice me or bump into me or somthing. I know we only met once but I really hope you remember me and I hope you felt what I felt. Maybe I'm just being stupid. Idk. We never see each other and we only met once and talked briefly. If you think it's you, look me up on Facebook. You're a grad student and you have a roommate. Maybe we have something.
