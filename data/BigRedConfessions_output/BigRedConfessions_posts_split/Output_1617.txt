I'll be graduating with an engineering degree in the spring, yet I feel mentally and emotionally unprepared for the job world. Although I had a little bit of work experience in my field this past summer, I don't believe it has prepared me for a fully-fledged job. As a result, I've been walking into interviews unprepared and unconvincing, despite the fact that I can articulate myself quite well. I've been applying to some jobs I might be interested in, but only half-heartedly, because somewhere deep down I haven't quite figured out what I want to do yet. I don't know how to explain it, but something just doesn't feel right- I don't feel "ready" enough. It's a bit unnerving because all of my peers full-out seem to know what they want to do, and I don't know why that level of maturity hasn't hit me after 3 years at Cornell. Maybe it's because I never took full advantage of the opportunities around me (research, work, etc.) outside of my coursework. Maybe I wasted 3 years trying to do well in my classes when I really should have been more career-driven, or more focused on building a network. I know that once I figure things out, I'll be determined enough to achieve anything I want, but I'm a little worried about my future at the moment because inside, I'm full of doubts.
