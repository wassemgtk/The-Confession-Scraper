I feel bad that I never go out on the weekends as much as I should. I want to meet people and have a good time, but then again, I don't want to feel pressured by guys that I meet to hook up.  I want to meet a nice guy to date, but not going out makes that so hard!  Everyone that I talk to always asks me why I don't have a boyfriend. I just wish guys were more forward with what they want and talk to girls that they may be interested in outside of the party scene.  I know it's a too way street, but I don't want to be too forward with a guy and be rejected :/ ugh.
