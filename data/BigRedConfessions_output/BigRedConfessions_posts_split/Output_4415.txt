I had an incredible year at Cornell last year so I was sad when summer came along because I didn't want to leave what had become my favorite place in the world. Even though I loved my job this summer, I was lonely and couldn't wait to be back to see all my friends again. Ever since coming back, though, it just hasn't been the same; the loneliness hasn't gone away. I think being away from all the wonderful people I met here for three months over the summer just made me feel too distant. I can feel myself retreating into my head, having more and more trouble actually talking to people without getting shy or nervous- even my close friends sometimes! During the day, it's not so bad because my mind is busy focusing on class, but in the evenings I feel really lonely, which just makes me get even more stressed and down. I really want to meet people because I think that would help, but parties aren't exactly conducive to nice, quiet conversation. (Tbh I really miss this time of freshman year, when everyone wants to meet and be friends with everyone else) I don't want to go the whole year crying myself to sleep, but I just don't really know what to do. Part of the trouble is that in some ways, there's nothing really wrong, and I can't find a solution to a problem if I'm just getting worked up and stressed about nothing.
