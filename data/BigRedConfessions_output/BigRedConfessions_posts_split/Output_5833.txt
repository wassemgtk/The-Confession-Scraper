"I would rather have 1 close friend than have 400 friends. Makes me wonder if this is why everyone here disappears once they get involved in a relationship. That's one person who loves you even when you're in glasses; who means it when they say 'call me anytime'; and who would spend nights by your bedside when you are grossly sick.

Thank you, my babe. I am glad that I decided to hang out with you at CTB that evening rather than cuddle in bed with my laptop and my iPhone.
