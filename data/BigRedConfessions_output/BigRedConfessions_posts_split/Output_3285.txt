I actually don't believe in global warming or climate change, whatever ya liberals or Republicrats wanna call it. Al Gore and other leftist politicians are making massive amounts of money peddling such a lie to uneducated fools. After all, CO2 is essential for plant life and plant growth. You need to understand concentrations, something that I as a PhD grad know. I am also a postdoctoral associate and I understand that the levels of CO2 in the atmosphere are actually helping with plant growth across the globe and there is no evidence to prove we are warming or that any conditions are the result of increased levels of CO2. We have the coldest temperatures on record currently for most parts of the globe. I do also believe that we are slowly progressing towards a colder climate as we are overdue for an ice age......Don't stress about fossil fuels and "fracking." Everything will be all right for y'all, after all we couldn't have the standard of living we currently have at Cornell if it were not for good ol' shale gas...our power plant consumes it and loves it over any other fuel coming mostly from the great states of West Virgina and Pennsylvania. (Shout out to whoever is from there) It's a fuel that burns cleanly and produces virtually no NOx and SOx with the right emissions control as we have at the CHP plant here at Cornell. America is once again energy independent....we are becoming net exporters of energy and it's benefiting our economy in the long run because of the shale gas revolution. Take some CHEME courses and actually learn about a great industry.....You will not be disappointed.  Go USA! USA! USA! ;)
