To #7887, I was in your situation last semester. I never fully opened up to my boyfriend at the time but he knew I was going through some stuff. Throughout that time I was in a constant anixety that if he knew how bad I was feeling, he wouldn't want to deal with me anymore. We winded up breaking up for other reasons mainly because the relationship was part of the reason why I was feeling so unlovable. Often people see me as confident and carefree when I carry these feelings that no one really cares about me around. But I guarantee you people do care about you! Everyone is in their own little world here but even if you can't tell your friends exactly how you feel, I bet if you told your closest ones and your boyfriend they would be shocked and would support you. We need to learn how to be vulnerable. Don't be afraid to speak to the people who actually do love you. They have no idea how you're feeling and as such, they think you don't need help and are too concerned with other cornell obligations. Don't fret- I felt everything you're feeling now and a whole bunch of us here have. Just remember how lovable you actually are. Even when people don't say it all the time, you are important to them. And most of all, you are worthy of love! I wish I could message you directly, but see I don't have the complete guts to be vulnerable either which is a shame, because when you are vulnerable you are free. Never be ashamed of what you feel because your feelings are valid even if they don't reflect the truth. Good luck!
