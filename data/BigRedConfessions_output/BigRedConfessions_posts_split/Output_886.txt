I really like you, and I think you like me too. It's just that you seem so shy, especially in group settings when it almost feels like you're ignoring me. I think we're both pretty introverted people, which makes things tough. And I think you might be uncomfortable with any type of obvious public acknowledgment, considering how young this is.

But I also think--and hope--that this will get better with time. And it's certainly worth the effort, because I really think there's something between us worth building on.
