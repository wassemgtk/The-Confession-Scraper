I don't know what I expected. The first hookup was a surprise- it caught me off guard, but I went with it, even though I felt a little uncomfortable. To be honest, I had never hooked up with someone like this before outside of a relationship. I went farther than I wanted to, but I convinced myself that I really liked you, and that it would be ok. The next hookup, I was more confident. I guess you could say I was truly an "active participant". We had a sleepover again, and the more I talked to you, the more I liked you. I thought we got along really well, and we had great physical chemistry. You introduced me to all of your friends, and you mentioned how much you wanted to hang out and how "lucky you were to have found someone like me". You made a point to say hi to me, and you made me happy in a friendly way. Then, your texts and snapchats became less frequent, and eventually, nonexistent. I asked you about it, and you said you didn't want a relationship, which I understood (because I felt/feel the same way). I even asked to hang out, and you said you'd let me know when a good time was. Of course, you never did, but I assumed you were busy. But then I saw you holding hands with someone else. I wouldn't have minded that if you had just told me the fucking truth. Why didn't you have the decency to tell me that there was someone else? Why did you let me believe that you liked me? Even as a friend? Why did you drop me so suddenly? What did I do to make you dislike me so much? What is wrong with me? How could I be so naive? Why did I let you take advantage of me? Why was I so weak? Why couldn't I have said "no"? Also, I guess that I have to admit that I did lie to you one time. No, I didn't have my period. I'm a virgin, and I was worried that you wouldn't want to talk to me again if you knew the truth. Little did I know that you were going to drop me anyways. :)
