To the boy who just broke my heart last night, I never tell you I have feelings for you from last semester, but that fact does not matter anymore. I can't stop thinking about you and what happened between us, I seriously think we are meant for each other. However, I understand what you said. If this is your decision, I will respect it. It's just I need some times right now to adjust what happened. Goodbye my lover, goodbye.
