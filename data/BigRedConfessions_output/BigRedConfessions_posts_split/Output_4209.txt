My favorite thing about being completely average looking (maybe even below average), is that I have no doubts about why people like me. (While this narcissistic post may imply otherwise,) I am liked for nothing more than my personality. I love knowing that when a guy has hopelessly fallen for me, or I send a girl into an uncontrollable fit of laughter, it's because of who I am as a person, and not some arbitrary physical characteristics I was assigned at birth. While my confidence in my appearance may be low, my confidence in myself has never been higher: and in an ideal world, (at least in an academically driven world), the latter is what matters. I've never been happier.
