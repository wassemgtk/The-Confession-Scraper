Does anyone else thinks it's odd when you go to the library and you have a stranger's face 3 feet away from yours for what could be 4-5 hours and it's someone you've never meet and will likely never meet. It just seems oddly intimate a thing for the amount of actual human contact you have which is zero. Like sometimes I take a break from studying and I find myself thinking - "Hm I wonder what this person is like" or "This person seems so cool I wish we could be friends" or "This person is out of this world hot" but alas, this is weirdly the least appropriate place to try and find any of those things out, despite the fact that, again, we are sitting face to face for 5 hours. Sometimes when they leave it almost feels like the end of a mini-relationship haha. Especially if in that 5 hours I've completed a big assignment or finished a paper - it's like you were the person who was there as I went thru that hardship and emerged on the other side :D I am usually too busy doing homework, but every now and again I look up and I am reminded of the social oddity that is sitting across from someone in the library. It's almost like the astronauts who have to remain focused on whatever they're repairing in space, but every once in a while they get a free 5 seconds and they go - oh right, the Earth is right there.
