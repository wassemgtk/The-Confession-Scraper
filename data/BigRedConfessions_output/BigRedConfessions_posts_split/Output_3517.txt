I've spent three out of four years at Cornell, and socially I have nothing to show for it. My few "friends" are superficial at best and I've been forced to break up with the love of my life, the best friend I've ever had -the one jewel from my time here- due to circumstances out of our control. I just want May to come so I can move on from this abysmal chapter of my life.
