Going on spring break made me way more happy than is probably normal. I used to wake up and just scream FUCK and then go to class. Now I can actually just not worry about anything for a few days. Im well rested, I feel happy throughout the day, i don't cry while I take a shower, i dont imagine how nice it would be to just step in front of a truck on that road that goes by libe slope. 
I just gotta make it through 5 more weeks when I get back and then it's summer!
