Hey everyone, I recently used Big Red Shipping and Storage to ship my entire summer wardrobe to my home address and Big Red seems to have lost my three FedEx boxes. If anyone knows anything or has experience anything similar at the end of this semester, please comment and let me know. The managers at Big Red are avoiding my questions and phone calls, and I don't know what to do. Please help if you know anything! Thank you so much!
