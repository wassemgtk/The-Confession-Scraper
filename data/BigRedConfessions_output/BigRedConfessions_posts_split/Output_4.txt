"Having a 4+ GPA is supposed to feel good. Graduating is supposed to feel good. Getting a good, well-paying job is supposed to feel good. None of it feels good. At every turn in my life, I feel like I'm either doing what I'm supposed to, or what I think is best for ""future me."" And I'm pretty good at it. I applied myself in high school because my parents wanted me to. I got into Cornell, and I came here because it was the best school I got into, and future me needed an education. I worked my ass off and graduated and got a good job, because that's what people are supposed to do. In the past couple of years, it's all come crushing in on me. I only can have fleeting moments of happiness, the rest of the time I feel empty at best or nervous and depressed at worst. I don't think anyone else realizes it because I usually seem like a cheery person, but between cheeky comments and dumb jokes I'm dying on the inside.

Everyone around me seems to have love, passion, or both, and I've never experienced either. I hoped that when I came here, I'd find something to be passionate about, but I've only felt alienated by people who have felt it since they were in diapers. Nothing I do ever ""speaks"" to me the way people say passion should. Whenever I get close to someone I panic and push them away. I can't open up to anyone. If I could, I'd be telling them all this, and not a Facebook page.

Sure, I have friends, and I like them, but now that they're mostly moved out and away, I just don't really feel much for them. Everyone was getting emotional, crying, demanding hugs, and I just smiled and said we'd meet again. I didn't care, but they did.

I do everything I'm supposed to do, and soon there won't be anyone telling me I'm supposed to do anything anymore. And it's terrifying. I don't have passion, and I don't have motivation. I don't know what I'll be living for, even though I've done everything right, as far as I can tell.

I don't know the last time I felt the way I'm supposed to feel, but it's all I really want."
