I don't like CTB anymore. Once I got rather goofy with friends and walked from North Campus to Collegetown with a giant ass tree branch in my ponytail, walking backwards, and shoeless. I got all the way to CTB, then was forced to remove said tree branch to enter. Then some scummy CTB-go-ers got jealous and stole my tree branch while I was inside. Their Pink My Little Pony Smoothies can suck it.
