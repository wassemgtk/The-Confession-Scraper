Every time I walk outside I hope an icicle would go straight through my head or I get hit by a bus. Anything. Something. I just can't take it anymore. I'm weak. Too weak to fight against the hurdles of life. I'm not as strong as the people around me. This is the way it was supposed to work. Natural selection weeds out the weak. Then, how did I slip through? I'm tired of fighting. I'm dying behind this smiling face. I feel like I'm ready to breakdown at any moment. Just so weak...
