I think I'm transgender and I'm terrified. I've had these feelings for a long time and recently they've only been getting stronger. I grew my hair out, wore dresses and makeup, and tried to act like a girl, but I just can't keep it up. I don't want to be transgender because my family is conservative and I know I won't have much of a future in the field I'm going into since it's also conservative. I want to set my body on fire, and I know that around 40% of trans people have attempted suicide and I should fight it, but honestly, I don't know what else to do.
