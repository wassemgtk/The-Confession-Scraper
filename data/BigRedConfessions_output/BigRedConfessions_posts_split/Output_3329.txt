My longtime significant other who I though I would marry and I broke up and now I'm seeing somebody new but every time we have sex all I think about is my ex and it breaks my heart in so different pieces for so many reasons. I don't get how a person says you're the love of their life and then turns around and gives up on you so quickly all because you hit a rough patch for the first time.
