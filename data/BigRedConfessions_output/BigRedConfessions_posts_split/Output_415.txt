Once I graduated, I realized how dumb many students were at Cornell and in colleges in general. Their style of thinking is so convoluted. I think in many cases it's not really their fault but the copious amounts of drugs they consume which are easy to obtain. Marijuana is an example. When one smokes weed, they become very calm and stupid. They talk like a 60's hippie thinking everything is cool. They don't worry about the serious realities of the world like politics and how to save this country from going down like the Titanic. I wish I could save some people from drugs, but I just can't and I feel bad that they have chosen that path.
