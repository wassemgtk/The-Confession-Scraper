"In response to 7526:

Whoa. Dang. Apologies. I honestly couldn't have anticipated this, nor did I expect it. But I don't like rubbing people the wrong way and I especially don't like coming off as domineering, especially as a man. So to clarify/further elaborate on this apology:

If I sound pretentious, this was not my intent. I don't necessarily think other people have poor taste in art, girls or otherwise. I just have a hard time finding people who appreciate my own. Perhaps this is my fault, and I'm willing to accept that. My tone may have conveyed otherwise.

As for falling asleep, you're only human. If someone falls asleep while I'm watching a movie with them, this isn't going to be a deal-breaker or anything. I suppose I could have rephrased this as: ""I enjoy spending time with people who are willing to stay up late and watch a good film."" Not so much that the absence of that quality is going to engender some kind of negative judgement from me (you're right, we are all busy Cornell students, although I am too in my defense but that's beside the point.) Rather, I just greatly appreciate the presence of this aforementioned quality. 

As for music. Music is my life. I listen to damn near everything. I'm one of last people you can expect to demean someone over their taste. I'm a wannabee hipster who, admittedly, finds himself generally underwhelmed by most people's tastes (again, girl or otherwise), but that doesn't mean I'm going to start critiquing people. You'd be hard-pressed to present some music that I wouldn't be interested in listening to with you and appreciating on some level.

I think you've interpreted my message as me trying to assert my ideas, tastes, and desires on a woman, which has a lot of really unsettling implications for gender relations and forces me to critically reevaluate myself and how I talk about relationships. So thank you, and please DO continue to live your life and speak out when people like me come around to say foolish things!! I should've thought that one through more. 

The initial purpose of that confession was really just to find people who are passionate about art. I assume that you must be, to some extent. In the spirit of what you've said about validating/supporting others' experiences with art--which by the way is absolutely something I agree with--I'd love to hear your top five songs or films! You could post them in a response to this confession. If you're willing to, of course. If not, no worries.

Wishing you the best in all your endeavors and truly hoping this finds it's way to your eyes :)"
