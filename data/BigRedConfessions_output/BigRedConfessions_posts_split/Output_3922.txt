While all the money and health problems pile up on my parents all I can do is fucking study more and finish more problem sets. Sure all of this might one day in the future pay off to the point where I can financially support my parents, but that day is so far away and I feel so powerless to help them now. And when people question my lack of friends or a social life they don't seem to understand that I have no room for error. My parents are depending on my future success. And I'd feel too guilty having fun while my parents work seven days a week to make ends meet. I really hate complaining about my life because I know I'm much more fortunate than most. But this year has just been a lot for me to handle and I need to let it out. Sorry
