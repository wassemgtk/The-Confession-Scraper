My hearts broken. I lost the only person i cared about in this world. From being fond of each other to now never talking. From being the person u tell everything, to being the person u do not tell anything.  Please do not hate me. Please dont. I am sorry i broke ur heart, but mine was broken too and because of pain i got bitter. Forgive me.
