I am happy that the Cornell Police have arrested and charged a former student for manufacturing Meth in Risley Hall. Now I hope he gets charged appropriately. Drugs are disgusting and I am proud to say I am drug free because I had to pass toxicology tests and polygraph tests to enter the FBI when I graduated Cornell. I hold very conservative viewpoints too but I'm sorry I love this country and have dislike for anyone who does drugs and fucking especially manufactures them. Good job Cornell Police, I salute you and get out my trumpet and fly a flag of intense support and congratulations. Thanks for taking care of this piece of crap brothers! I tip off my hat to you.
