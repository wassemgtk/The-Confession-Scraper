You know who my favorite Cornell alumna is? Ruth Bader Ginsburg. AKA Notorious RBG, Ruth Badass Ginsburg. The woman who completely bashes the dumb sorority girl stereotype and makes me proud to be a sister of a sorority here. She is TRUE FEMINIST showing just how much a woman can make a difference in this country. I am a proud woman attending Cornell, because I hope that one day to be like her, a woman fighting for what she believes in no matter what anyone thinks.
