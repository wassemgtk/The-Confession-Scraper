I hate being that shy. I am a pretty good looking guy, interesting, funny. I get a lot of looks from very pretty girls. All I need is to get up and go talk to them, and I'm sure I'd do pretty well. However, when it comes down to it, I freeze. 5 mins before deciding to talk to them, I would imagine every favorable scenario in my head. But at the moment, when I get up, I'd be sure that they reject me. And after the moment has passed and I have done nothing about it, I regret it, because I'm sure again that it would've worked.
