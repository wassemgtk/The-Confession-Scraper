"Let's get something straight: a shitty day or two is no excuse to be nasty to others. You may not be able to control what happened or how you felt about it, but you can sure as hell control how you interact with others.
You'd probably call this passive aggressive, but you're not even going to figure out that it's about you, wrapped up in your own head as you are. Because everything's about you, isn't it? You're constantly trying to one-up me and put me down. And though it's only been a few weeks, I'm sick of it. You treat me terribly. You're not a friend. You're just someone I have to deal with.
