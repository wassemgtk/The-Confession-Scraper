Sometimes I feel lonely and insignificant in this gigantic place.
But then I remember I have the world's best boyfriend who does so much for me without me even asking and the world's #1 best friend who would hunt down anybody that upset me. And I found them both in this gigantic place. And then I realize, I'm the luckiest girl in the world. :)
