"As an international graduate alumnus, I hesitate to open my wallet when I receive emails asking for donation. Here is why:

1) No scholarship. I had a significantly good application, good interviews and stuff. I got admitted, got a top-tier job and contributed to the school's stats. I know, I couldn't get without Cornell, so thanks for that. But I paid for this education (out of my own pocket, not daddy's). 
2) 7.25% per year in interest for my student loans. Enough said. 

If at least I had the same few thousands my American colleagues had with a worse application, I would give back so much more. Also, It seems that ""diversity scholarships"" is only for American Black, American Women and American LGBT, but they forget the Asians, Latinos, foreign women, etc, etc... If I ever become rich, I'll definitely donate, but I'll make sure these ""unseen"" population get their scholarship.

Honestly, I love American people. My best friends were born here. But school's policy for scholarships is just shitty."
