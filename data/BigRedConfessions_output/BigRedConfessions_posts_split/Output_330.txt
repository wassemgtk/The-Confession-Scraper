I think I need help. I hate my life. I want to die. But I'm afraid if I go to Gannet, they will try to kick me out or my parents will find out when they see the bill. I just want to disappear. Nobody would even notice until my body started to smell. I have no friends. I would just be gone. When someone dies, theres always the Facebook pages of people recounting favorite memories and missing the person. I can't think of a single person who would care enough to write a post for me.
