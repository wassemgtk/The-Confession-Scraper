We've been really close friends since freshman year and I really like her and all that but.... Sometimes she's realllllly blunt and I can't handle it. Ever since this one incident I've been unconsciously mean to her but I can't control it. Even having normal conversation we can't agree on one thing and she does things that I can't really understand you can joke and fool around and shit but you are not supposed to cross the line.
