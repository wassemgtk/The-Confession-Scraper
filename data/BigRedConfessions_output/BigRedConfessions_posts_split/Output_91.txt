I'm going to graduate at the age of 26 and I feel so useless. I have a good job lined up after graduation and I'm happy with what I've been given. But I feel so far behind all of my peers. Everyone's already saved up and getting married. Meanwhile I'll be stuck here for another year and will probably not be able to buy a house for 4 or 5 more years.
