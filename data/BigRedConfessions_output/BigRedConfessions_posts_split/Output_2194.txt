Life would be so much easier if I were smart. I'm tired of hearing the sympathetic "Oh, but you got into Cornell!" speech. It doesn't say sh*t about my intelligence. It only shows my ability to work hard and conform to the already-mediocre American school system. At Cornell, I'm average, and sadly, I have to work pretty hard to maintain that spot.Often, I see my peers who didn't go to fancy colleges do great things, and I'm suddenly ashamed that I came here. What a waste of tuition. Here, I'm tossed to the side because I'm not good enough. Not good enough to get an internship, not good enough to TA, be a part of a project team, anything. I want to do something meaningful with my life, but I feel frustrated because I haven't found what that is yet. I've literally had people ignore me or my efforts to help them because I wasn't "capable" enough in their eyes, and that was such a harsh blow to the ego. On top of all this, it doesn't help being an introvert either. I constantly struggle to have my voice heard, and I struggle to make the "connections" so many people form effortlessly. I just want to go home.
