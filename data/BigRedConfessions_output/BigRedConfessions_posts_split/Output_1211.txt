I think "netflix and chill" is a funny term that we have added to our lingo, but hear me out on this: does it all contribute to what some people consider "rape culture?" I know "netflix and chill" is now a very well-known innuendo for engaging in sexual activity, and if you consent to "netflix and chill," you imply your consent for all other unspecified activities... but actually that's now how it works, or rather, that's not how it should work. I think it's possible that the popularity of this term represents a very subtle, mostly harmless (if an aspect of rape culture can be considered so) way we have let the idea of consenting to one thing that usually leads to sex become a substitute for actually consenting to sex. I don't imagine that I will be raped next time I consent to "netflix and chill," but I think it is in the same line of assuming that someone will have sex with you if you walk them home from a party, plan to study really late in their room, or crash at their place. This will probably get a lot of hate from people who enjoy using this comical term, and I expect that, but please consider the underlying connotations with this very popular innuendo.
