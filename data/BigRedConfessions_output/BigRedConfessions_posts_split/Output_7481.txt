There's this girl I keep seeing around campus, with a pink beanie and short hair. There's practically no chance of you ever seeing this, but since there's literally no socially acceptable circumstance I can spark a conversation with a random girl I see more than once a month I'll say it here:
Nice beanie! 
Also, you're extremely attractive.
