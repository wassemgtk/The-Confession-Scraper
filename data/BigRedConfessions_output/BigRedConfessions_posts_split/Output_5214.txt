This is probably going to come out wrong but I'm an incredibly inteoverted person and I have too many friends. 

 It's really hard for me to juggle seeing them all time wise but if they're all together with me at a party or bar or something I get overwhelmed and want to go hide out in a corner. 

I don't know what to do because as time goes on I just keep meeting more amazing people but I'm not a social butterfly and need time to myself as well. I don't know how to find a balance.
