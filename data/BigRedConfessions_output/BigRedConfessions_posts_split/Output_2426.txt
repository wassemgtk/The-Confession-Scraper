We met the first day of Freshman year. I was attracted to you the minute we met (yes I know it sounds clich√©). I was excited when I learned we would be in the same major, and have similar classes. After getting to know you over two years, I was ready to make my move but you were already in a happy relationship with someone else. Not asking you out sooner is probably my only regret from my time at Cornell. As we prepare to graduate, I know that we will go our separate ways but hope that we will stay in touch. If you are ever single, I would be interested to see if there could be something between us.
