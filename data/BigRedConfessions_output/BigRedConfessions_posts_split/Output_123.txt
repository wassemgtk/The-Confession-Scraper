"I love Cornell and I love the College of Engineering. I just wish that it was more focused on preparing me to be an informed citizen and knowledgeable engineer rather than a potential employee. I’m a freshman in Engineering and I’m trying to figure out my next 3 years here. 

Ever since I started looking at colleges, I knew I wanted to study abroad. I chose Cornell knowing that my financial aid package would carry over and that there were hundreds of places I could go. My cousins and brother have told amazing stories of their experiences studying in Bogotá, London, and Nepal, and they all are still in contact with the friends they made. I came to this school expecting that I could also have an experience like this. 

Yet, the way that my program is designed, I have only one semester I could study abroad: Junior Spring. This is fine, I would definitely love to go then. But if I study abroad then, I won’t finish school in May, more likely I’ll finish in June when most international programs end. And then I won’t be able to have an internship before my senior year. My adviser says that having an internship then is essential to getting a job after graduation. (Also, it should be said that I’ll be working full time this summer and nearly full time on winter break, so I don’t think I could do it then either)
So now I don’t know what to do. Do I (as cliché as it sounds) follow the dream I’ve had since middle school or suck it up and take the route that will “make me more employable” in the future?"
