Don't let the hipsters confuse you. You are your GPA. Your GPA is you. Without one, the other does not exist. The definition of GPA? You. The definition of you? GPA. One cannot talk about a student without talking about the GPA. Why? Because the student is the GPA. They are one. 

The distinction between GPA and a student is caused by a problem in language. There is no logic in saying a student has a GPA. What is student if not the GPA? A student does not have a GPA, he is the GPA. They are the same.
