"I hate reading posts on social media from students and alumni saying how much they love Cornell, and how they're going to miss it (or how they already do), how it was the best time of their life, and how being in the real world will/or already does suck, and blah blah blah. I hated Cornell. It was stressful, it was lonely, it was night upon night of never sleeping. Don't get me wrong, I had friends and I had moments where I said ""Fuck all"" and had a relaxing moment or two, but I feel like I would have been so much happier had I transferred out. But I stayed and I graduated. Probably the only reason I didn't transfer was because finaid covered everything here, and I wouldn't have gotten such a great deal anywhere else.
And puh-lease. The real world is so easy, are you kidding me? My job pays the bills and then some (in a field unrelated to my education), I've got twice as many friends as I did in undergrad, and it's so great having free time again! I can finally spend time doing things I enjoy! (a tiny example: when was the last time you read a book for fun?) A great weight was lifted from my shoulders when I graduated.

Fuck Cornell and the unnecessary heaps of stress and ungodly workloads it places upon its students because of whatever bullshit it thinks it has to prove to the outside world.
