Going back to the OP # 6498 who wrote about the death penalty for drug traffickers. Instead of wasting money ordering barbiturates for the lethal injection and also using massive amounts of taxpayer money for the setup and doctors required, I would support the use of a firing squad in addition to "Ol' Sparky" for death penalty offenses like they still do in Utah. I think morale would improve in society if more states started using the cheaper method of a firing squad like they did in the past, after all they only need a cop and ammo, both of which are already available to perform this execution for high level offenders. It would not only save money, but also reduce crime and the need for high reincarceration rates like in the states of New York and California because people would be afraid of committing a high level crime, and the murder rate would drop to the low amount it is in states where the death penalty is very prevalent like Texas and Oklahoma.
