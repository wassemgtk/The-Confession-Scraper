Just want to make a quick comment about "fuckboys" of this generation. Why do so many guys feel like it's okay to treat girls like they are just objects without feelings?? Even if you're a heartless bitch, doesn't mean that everyone else is the same way, so please be considerate of others' feelings. Life is so hard on its own and I feel like the least we can do as decent beings is to be kind to one another, as cheesy as that may sound. Whether it be a small or grand act, everything goes a long way and can avoid bringing someone that unnecessary emotional burden. I speak from experience and it was (and still isn't) easy to fully recover from being treated like shit. It's not easy at all. To whomever is reading this, I sincerely just ask you not to treat people like shit.
