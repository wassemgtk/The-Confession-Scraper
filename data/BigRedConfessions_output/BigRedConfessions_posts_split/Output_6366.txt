I know you have a long-term girlfriend, and I should be content with us just being friends. And in some ways, I am. You are such an amazing person and I feel lucky every day to have you in my life. Even though I said I'm over you, I can't help but think that it should be us. There's so much between us that can't be said and you know that I'm terrible at holding things back. But we both know it's there. And we would be so right.
