"I tried to stop myself, but I've definitely been falling for you. It's been great getting to know you in the structured context of class and meetings; I just really wish we could hang out on our own, sometime. I don't think you have any free time, though, and I'm afraid to ask, because it could completely backfire and we'd have no choice but to still see each other all the time, and pretend it never happened.

But I don't know. Maybe the risk is worth it.

(You haven't liked this page on facebook, but why am I still hoping you might somehow see this?)"
