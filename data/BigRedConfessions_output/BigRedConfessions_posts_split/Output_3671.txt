"Hey you,

You told me that I thought about us too much and that's why we didn't work out. I didn't believe you at first, but now I think maybe you were right. Now that there's no ""us"" to worry about, I realize that I really did have feelings for you, and not just the friendly feelings that I persuaded myself I had. I know it hasn't been long since everything ended, but I've spent every moment thinking about you. It's so hard to give you space when all I want to do is chat you up on Facebook and make sure you're doing alright. 

I know this is not how you feel, but I can't think of anything I would've rather done with the little free time that I had, that we spent together watching videos and talking 'til god knows when in the morning. I'm sorry that we ended so bitterly and I'll miss not being able to stumble into your room for no reason and ending up staying for hours.

You deserve so much more than a girl who could never make up her mind, and I hope you will find her soon. Maybe then we can go back to the friendship that we started with, that I cared so much about, that I was so scared to lose. "
