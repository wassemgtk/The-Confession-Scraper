Whenever I have to fart I always take into consideration who is around me. If it's a girl I immediately get a heart attack when I accidentally let it slip and I try to do as much damage control as possible--squeak my chair, tap my pencil, clear my throat, cough, burp and open a container of food to release new smells, etc. If it's a guy I ALWAYS smile mischievously and try to waft it in the direction of the unsuspecting bystander. There is always a look of satisfaction when I have successfully driven away an "intruder" from my favorite study spot in the library. Hehehe.
