I screwed up. Our relationship just started, and she asked me if it'd be okay if she spent the weekend with her recent ex boyfriend. She said it'd be platonic, I said okay. I didn't want to seem jealous or clingy at the time, but now the thought of it is eating me up inside. I wish I didn't feel things.
