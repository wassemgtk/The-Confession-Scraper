"I want to thank the man who this record is about, who I fell in love with last year," said Sam Smith. "Thank you so much for breaking my heart, because you got me four Grammys." 

Just remember: whatever pain you're going through, no matter how enduring it seems, is actually ephemeral. Heartbreak, school woes, family issues, self image problems, whatever you are going through: you can overcome it. Doing so won't occur overnight but you have to cultivate the pain and make it into something useful. Make the pain worthwhile. Tattoo it on you. Don't squelch it in shame but own it. Use it. Sam Smith did.
