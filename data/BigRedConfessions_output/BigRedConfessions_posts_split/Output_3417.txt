i've met this guy a couple times. he's accepted as attractive and has a nice personality. last night at a party, i talked with him a few times and at one point we were on the dance floor together. not really dancing with each other, just looking at each other as we danced. there was a bond and i looked for him later, but couldn't find him. he doesn't have a facebook and although i know where he lives, it's sad that it'll likely amount to nothing.
