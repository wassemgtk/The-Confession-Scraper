As I sit in my bed and see friends in relationships or hear about friends starting relationships, I wonder if It's ever going to happen to me. I've had flings in the past, but I've always overthought stuff to the point where it didn't work out. Call me old-fashioned and romantic (I hope), but I'm the kind of guy who gradually starts liking a girl because I want to get to know them first. I might just be really bad about timing, but sometimes I truly wonder if I will truly find the one. Or maybe I will just die alone.
