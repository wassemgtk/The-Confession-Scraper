"I feel extremely strange posting this. I have nobody to tell that wouldn't judge me for this, so I guess here we go.
I'm lonely. I've never been an extrovert, I'm pretty shy at first, and I'm fine just having a few friends like I do. But I see my friends in relationships and I'm extremely jealous. I'm almost a 20 year old woman and I've never kissed or been kissed. I've never even held a guy's hand. I want the intimacy and closeness I see other people share. someone I can tell anything and everything to and listen in return. Nobody has ever expressed any interest in me, and I know I'm not the most beautiful girl in the world, but I'm not hideous and I can be pretty damn funny and nice if you take the time to talk to me. I've tried to befriend guys in my classes that I think are attractive or seem like great guys but nobody ever seems to reciprocate.
It doesn't seem to be unreasonable to ask for. I put myself out there, and I would have no clue how to ask someone out but I would probably say yes to anybody who asked. I just want companionship. And if I'm being honest I'm pretty sexually frustrated too. I love sex, even if I've never had it with another person, and I'd love to have that experience with someone I can connect with. This seems really whiny and immature, but I just needed to vent this, none of my friends would even understand or acknowledge me if I told them this so I guess I'm just another coward behind a keyboard for now.
