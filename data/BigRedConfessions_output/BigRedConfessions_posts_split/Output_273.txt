I am also a young guy in college and am pretty conservative when it comes to sex--I see it as an intimate moment to be shared with someone you care and love. But in my group of friends, I'm the odd man out. I'm pretty sure all of the guys I'm friends with make fun of me behind my back for not trying to score every time we go out and making "virgin" jokes when I'm not around. I'm not particularly religious, but thus is just something I value.

My first time was amazing and with my girlfriend in high school. Now that I'm in college, I feel like I'll never find someone who shares the same values. It's either they're super religious, or extremely open about sex and have racked up in the triple digits by graduation. Am I making a mistake by not experimenting? I want to live and die by the arbitrary principles I've made for myself. But I hope that won't mean having to die alone and penniless or having to settle down with some girl who has the exact opposite views.
