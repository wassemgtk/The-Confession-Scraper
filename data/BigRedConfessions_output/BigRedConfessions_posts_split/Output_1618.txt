Tinder is a vat full of disappointment for us sensitive souls. We reach in with the ladle, going back for seconds and thirds, and are left with the same bad taste in our mouths each time. I'm not talking about those of us who actually use it for what it's for - I'm talking about those of us who mistakenly go on it in search of meaningful connection; to find a significant other in a world where it has become increasingly difficult to do so. A world that is dominated by technology and, "no - I'm staying in tonight (to watch Netflix/play iPhone games/Facebook...)." I really should know better than to use this app and try to hook someone with a witty comment or something, but I don't know what else to do. I don't know how to manage this world of dating and getting to know guys...  I'm completely lost, and I don't want to be anymore. I think this will be the last time I delete tinder.
