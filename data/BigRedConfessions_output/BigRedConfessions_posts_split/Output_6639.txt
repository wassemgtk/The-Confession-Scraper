I wish girls weren't advised to play games with guys. (Guys wonder why girls play games? It's because we're fucking told to) I repeatedly hear, "Don't make it too easy for him," "Don't text him first," "Don't be too forward he'll think you're a slut." What kind of a fucking world do we live in where I have to treat a guy like he's a mindless animal that need to be trained properly and lured in properly in order to catch him? No, I refuse to be a part of this. I'm sorry girls but I think your advice is stupid. I don't want to be with a guy who won't date me because I'm too forward or I express too much interest in him. I don't want to date some ignorant asshole who slut shames. I don't want to have to strategically deny sex to a guy that I like just because I'm told that if I let him have it too early he'll lose interest. Honestly, if these are the kinds of tactics girls believe they need to use to get guys, are you people even mature enough to have serious relationships? Relationships aren't about games, they're not about who texts first, they not about all of those petty things that feed your gossip circles. Relationships are about compassion, trust, good companionship, and feeling a connection with someone. If you're actually deeply compatible with a guy, you both will realize it soon enough. You won't need to worry about your texting schemes and how long you're going to wait to have sex, because if it's a real connection none of those things fucking matter.
