I wish that people would stop perpetuating racial stereotypes by making crass and un-funny racially-motivated jokes about people that they've never met. I'm black. My parents (who are married, and have been for almost 30 years) make quite a bit of money. We've never lived in the ghetto, and we almost certainly never will. We tip generously. I think that BLM has some good points, but some of their more militant ideas, and how they go about communicating those ideas to people, turn me off. I had straight As (except for one B+) in high school and good SATs, so I'm pretty sure affirmative action wasn't my ticket into Cornell. But reading things like "black people score lower than other races on standardized tests; they wouldn't get into college without AA" gets tiring, and very often leads to assumptions being made on my (and other black people's) intelligence, before I (we) even get a chance to demonstrate my (our) skills and work ethic.

Reading and hearing that stereotypes still play such a huge role in how people view members of your race - as though we are all carbon copies of one another - gets really old, really fucking fast, especially when you fit almost none of the stereotypes associated with your race. I just wish people would realize how harmful these assumptions are, stop making them, and actually attempt to educate themselves by talking to people and listening to their experiences. People aren't the caricatures that you think they are.
