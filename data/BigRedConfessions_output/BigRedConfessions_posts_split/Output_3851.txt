"I've been holding back writing about this because it all sounds so cliche, so hollywood-esque. So fake ,to me at least. But I figure wtf, if I get some negative feedback here no harm done. And if I get any positive feedback, then that's solid. 

I'm in love with my best friend. We've gone through a lot together. A whole lot. Looking back I know that there were opportunities for me to make a move but I guess I botched them. She goes to school in North Carolina and I'm here. My family absolutely loves her more than anyone else (friend or significant other) that I've brought home. 

I know she's really bad with long distance relationships, she's cheated in the past. I think thats one of the reasons I've never truly told her about how I felt. I don't want things to be weird. But at the same time I'm hopeful that if I did tell her, then maybe we could make it work. 

Oh wait, I forgot. She has a new boyfriend. Both of us have dated a few different people over the past couple years, and I've met some incredible women. But no one close to her. I have this evergrowing fear of that phone call, one year from now, two, three, whenever it might be.. that she's engaged. And its not to me. She brings out the absolute best in me. And I like to think that I make her a better person too. 

When you see all that shit in the movies or in books about the one that got away, she is the epitome of that for me... But what can I do? To sound cliche yet again, I can't imagine her not in my life. So do I take my own advice I give to others, and feel the fear and do it anyway? Knowing that I tried? Or do I hope that they break up and that come May (when we both graduate from grad school), we'll both move to the bay area where we both have jobs waiting?

I apologize. This is some sappy nonsense. But its been bugging me out for a while now. "
