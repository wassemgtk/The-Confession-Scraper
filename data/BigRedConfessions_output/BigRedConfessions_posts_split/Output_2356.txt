I came in as a sophomore transfer and I knew it would be hard for me to make friends because of my shy disposition. I thought by the end of the year I might find my place or at least make a friend or two but I still haven't made any social progress at all.. What most frustrating is that I think I fell in love with someone on the first day of classes and I'm afraid of trying to talk even though the few times we have it has always been so very pleasant. I can't stand it, you have the most wonderful blue-green aura, a beautiful voice and the kindest disposition. I know if I just tried to reach out to you that we could be friends but I think I would just fall for you even more and I doubt that you'd ever see me that way especially when it feels as though people see me as an empty shell. I think I'll just make do with the fluttering in my stomach whenever our eyes meet.
