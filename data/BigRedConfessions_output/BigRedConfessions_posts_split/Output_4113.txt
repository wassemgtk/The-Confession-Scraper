"PSA:
If you've found yourself in a slump, take an anonymous mental health screening at this link [http://screening.mentalhealthscreening.org/collegeresponse] and please consider getting help, or at the very least just talking to a friend about your struggles. Depression is real and goes untreated far too often. You're not alone, even though it may feel like it.
Love,
Someone who cares about you."
