I'm sorry. I'm sorry I don't have a reason why I don't love you. And I know that hurts, I've been on the receiving end of that before too. But I just don't. And I can't change how I feel. I'm not going to come up with bullshit about how I'm just not feeling it, or that we don't click, or whatever. Because despite the fact that we're good for each other, and we get along well, even when we don't, there's something about this that I don't want. And it frustrates me too, that I don't know why. So please please don't push for a relationship right now. Because the answer isn't going to be what you want. I keep being told by all your friends that you're a good guy -- it's like they can sense that I might run. And I don't want to. But it's just not there, whatever "it" is. I am so sorry.
