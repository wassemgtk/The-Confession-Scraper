I may not always get along with my family members, but recently, my heart is breaking for them. My mom called me and asked me to vote every day this week for a chance to makeover our bathroom. For the past ten years, it has been my experience that once something in our house breaks beyond a simple repair, it stays broken. Our house was built with 2 bathrooms: one upstairs, one downstairs. Ever since I can remember, the downstairs shower has not been functional. In the past few years, the downstairs toilet broke and it was removed from the bathroom without replacement. That bathroom is only really useful for washing hands. Recently, it has become clear that the upstairs shower is falling apart, and there are some serious issues with the plumbing.

When I visited for winter break, I was standing in the kitchen and noticed a trickle of water leaving one of the cabinets IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE UPSTAIRS TOILET WAS FLUSHED. Apparently, the same thing happens when someone takes a shower. I was so disgusted by the condition that my home was in the last time that I visited, that I packed up and spent the rest of my time at my sister’s apartment. I am honestly scared that the first floor ceiling of my family’s house will one day cave in.

When I was in high school, I started to notice that things were getting progressively worse. When our washer and dryer broke, my mom started going to the laundromat because they were too expensive to fix or replace. No one was ever invited over to our home because it just wasn’t a welcoming environment.

I am a recent Cornell graduate, and am currently attending grad school in public health. I think that everyone deserves to live with a certain amount of dignity, and I plan to spend my career ensuring that all people have access to healthy living conditions, but seeing as I am still in grad school with multiple loans to pay off, I’m afraid I will be too late to help my own family. To some extent, my parents are responsible for the house that they live in, but my little brother, who is still in high school, deserves a better chance. 

The home makeover contest is hosted by the radio station 100.7 WHUD. If you go to their website, then click “home makeover,” then “Click here to vote,” and then search on “loosening,” that’s my mom’s entry. It only has 8 votes right now because my mom is too embarrassed to tell anyone but me and my sister. The 3 of us have been voting each day since it started on Monday (April 20th). We have until midnight on Sunday (April 26th) to vote, and each person can vote once each day.  None of the entries have broken 200 votes yet. If even a fraction of the people who check this page daily decide to vote for my mom’s entry, she could easily win $4500, and I cannot even describe how grateful she would be. Voters have to create an account to login, but it takes less than 1 minute. Also, you have to be from NY, NJ, or CT. But knowing the make-up of the Cornell student body, that shouldn’t hurt our numbers too much.

I met some of the most inspirational and compassionate people during my time at Cornell, and I know that together, we can make a difference. If my mom wins this contest, I will take it upon myself to ensure that the money is used in the most sensible way possible. For example, it might be most economical to vacate the upstairs bathroom, and fix the downstairs one. Please pass this information on to your NY, NJ, and CT friends. Thank you!
