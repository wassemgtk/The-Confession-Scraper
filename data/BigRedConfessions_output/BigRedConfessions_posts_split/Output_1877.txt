Last fall I tried to kill myself. I ended up being convinced by my friend to call 911 after I took all of my medication. I wish that I didn’t. I am stuck with a hospital bill that I can’t pay, even though I told the doctors that I could not afford to stay in the hospital. $10,000 Later I am released and required to take a mandatory leave from school for two semesters whilst paying back a $2000 refund that was mistakenly given to me. Well 6 months into my leave I start getting calls from Sallie Mae about my loans and how I have to pay them. $300 a month…which I don’t have. I work from 5pm to 3am overnight to make less than $900 a month to watch it all go away. I’ve lost over 40 pounds because I can’t afford to buy any food to eat often. 

I wish I had died that night so I wouldn’t have to deal with this. 
I know some people are gonna say, ""but if you didn’t try and kill yourself in the first place you wouldn’t be having to deal with any of this”

This is what my school told me and my counselor and Sallie Mae. I’m sorry I can’t control my depression. This is what made me want to die. People telling me not to feel the way I do, but I can’t help it. 

I just want someone who understand how I feel to help me instead of telling me not to feel a certain way….I know people are gonna but me down and make me feel like shit and call me weak because of this. 
I've been told this all my life so go ahead, you are just reiterating something I already know.
