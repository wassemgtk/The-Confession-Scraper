why can't i use names on here when i'm saying something positive about a person!

Admin: It's part of our policy to make sure that everyone's identity is protected, whether the comments are good or bad. Something that may seem like a compliment may draw negative attention to the target--so just to be safe, we want everything to be 100% anonymous.
I hope this answers your question :)
