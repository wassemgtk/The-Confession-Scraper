I have the biggest crush on this guy, but I don't even know his name. Something about the blonde hair, polo shirt, khakis, and glasses just turns me on. I see you at lunch sometimes, and I want to say hi, but I just feel so awkward. I want to sit with you, get to know you, be close. But I don't even think you'd be into me. I guess I'll just have to keep admiring you from afar.
