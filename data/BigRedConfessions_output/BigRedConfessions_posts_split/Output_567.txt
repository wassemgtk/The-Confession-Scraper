"I recently figured out that I am a furry i.e. I like to dress up and role play as various animals with my sex partners with behaviors ranging from anthropomorphic to completely feral. I've never been a part of a group which is viewed as a somewhat controversial minority and, now that I am, I'm much more tolerant and understanding of other people's (consensual) sexual interests or kinks. I was never that judgmental to begin with but what I mean is that I'm no longer surprised to meet people who like to be painted with Nutella, ""kidnapped"" and pegged by alien dildos, whipped and/or flogged while being humiliated, etc. I guess what surprises me though is that a lot of kink has gone mainstream while the furry fandom still seems to attract a lot of controversy. I wonder if it has something to do with the perceived association with beastiality? If anyone reading this note has that perception, I can at least say anecdotally that I haven't run into any furries who have displayed any interest whatsoever in sexually abusing animals. For me, the excitement of being a furry is in thinking about how to display masterfully your perceptions of an animal's personality i.e. your fursona and stepping outside the stresses and behavioral expectations in the various roles you play in your day-to-day life to have some fun. 

Anyway, there's no astounding conclusion here. I just wanted to put some thoughts out there. I wish there were more people on campus and around town who are furries who want to play. I also hope there will come a time when won't have to hide my sexual preferences and live in fear that someone will recognize me through my costume/make-up and judge me harshly for it. 

I hope everyone has a lovely day and, after reading this, feels a bit more comfortable in their skins (no pun intended) knowing that whatever you like (or even you're asexual!) as long as it's not hurting anyone (unless they have explicitly consented the desire to experience pain) you go ahead and live your life, explore and have lots of fun doing whatever gets you off!
