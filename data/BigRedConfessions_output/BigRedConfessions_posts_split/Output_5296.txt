I disappointed myself so much this year. I think the only way it could be worse is if I had dropped out of school altogether. But now, where do I go from here? How do I correct the thousand mistakes I've made, if you can never get back lost time? There was so much I wanted to do, but now there's even less than I CAN do. I couldn't choose between anything before, and I can't choose now, and I'm still lonely as ever, between all these different groups of people I didn't fit in with, in the first place.
