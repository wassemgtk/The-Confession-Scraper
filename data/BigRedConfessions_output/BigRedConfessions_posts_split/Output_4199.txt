I work in the Hotel School and there is this guy who always forgets something. At first it was his shoes, them it was his book bag. Tonight, it was his Mac charger. When I told him that I wasn't able to unlock the door, he rolled his eyes and mumbled under his desk. Turns out I could unlock it and now I have a Mac charger for a computer I don't own.
