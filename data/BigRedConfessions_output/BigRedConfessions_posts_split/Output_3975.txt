"So, everyday I tell myself that I should survive. And every week I tell myself, that if I get through this week, I will survive Cornell. But it's been three months, I have exactly three friends and I can barely keep it together. I am scraping through classes, managing to keep decent grades, learn what is necessary, but I have no marketable skills. I am not an expert in anything, barely good at a few things and mediocre at most things to say the least. I can't talk to people in my class because I guess it's some form of social anxiety, which is so mild that it does not deserve attention as I have no problems visibly. Maybe my classmates think I am a snob or an asshole and I think I am too cool to talk to them, but actually it's not that. I just suck at conversations I guess. Added to that, since I have nothing that I can say that I am actually good at, I am scared of asking the profs for a recommendation letter, cos' let's face it, nobody wants average, everyone wants the BEST. Cornell is a school of winners and for winners, not a loser like me. So, yeah! Why did you accept me, Cornell? Why did you accept me so that I could come here to Ithaca and realize what a loser I am?
And of course the icing on the cake is that my dad lost his job, my mom is struggling with two jobs and my sister is at home, but barely talks to them, because she is undergoing depression. I should be home with my family, helping them, not in this frozen shithole :-("
