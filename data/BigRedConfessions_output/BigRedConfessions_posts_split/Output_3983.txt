"You'll probably never read this...I'm pretty sure you don't even read Cornell Confessions
I hope somehow you do read this and know its for you
I was really hopeful because I thought maybe that last post about someone being shy, was you...I'm still not sure really.

I met you this semester
I got to know you just over a week ago and so much has happened in this one week
You're so cute
you caught my eye and I don't think I've stopped staring
I never ever thought things would escalate so quickly
It was the heat of the moment, so hot, and so romantic.
I've loved every moment that I've spent with you so far
You're so silly, so honest, so quirky..haha and so smug.

But I don't know what you want and I don't want to push you into anything.
You're still new to relationships and probably want to explore your options...and don't know what you really want (not that I really do..but i have a better idea from experience?)
I've been pretty lost myself and then you came along.
I havent felt that tickle in the pit of my stomach in so long and I don't want to let it go.

Its selfish I know
I just hope you feel the same way.

All I can do is keep on smiling at you :)"
