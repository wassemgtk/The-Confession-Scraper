Yesterday I had to have a small surgical procedure, and it was my first time having anesthesia so I was a bit nervous. Before going in for surgery, my anesthesiologist came out and after he asked where I go for school he said he went to Cornell and began to sing me the Alma mater. I instantly felt much more comfortable with that Cornellian!
