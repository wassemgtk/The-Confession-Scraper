If you think you're a "nice guy," but girls keep saying no to you, and you decide you must become a jerk for some reason...? Hate to burst your bubble, but you were already a jerk. Pretty ridiculous to think you automatically deserve more than friendship, and that friendship is a terrible thing to have. Just don't have friends then.
