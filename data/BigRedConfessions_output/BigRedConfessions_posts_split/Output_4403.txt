From the mix of positive and negative posts on this page, I get the sense that Cornell must be a kind of meh place. Maybe my life here is meh, but I haven't noticed yet! Now I just have one goal: to find the right girl to share my life with, my (apparently) mediocre life that doesn't seem to have a downside. Wish me luck! My search isn't over yet!
