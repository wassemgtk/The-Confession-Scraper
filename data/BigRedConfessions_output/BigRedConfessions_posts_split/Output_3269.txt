There's this girl that I always see around Stocking or in the Dairy Bar. She's got the most amazing Hobbit backpack I've ever seen, and yesterday she was wearing a Hobbit T-shirt too, and her hair was dyed awesome red.
From one Hobbit fan to another, you have the coolest style I've seen since I came to Cornell. Always brings a smile to my face.
