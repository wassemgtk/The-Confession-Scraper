I've had to convince myself, throughout my 3 years here so far, that I'm too ugly to have a girlfriend and too boring to have friends outside of classes (irrespective or whether or not either of these is true, which is besides the point) in an attempt to drive thoughts about relationships or friendships out from my mind, just so I can force myself to focus on nothing but classes and research. This way I can put all my time and effort into learning as much about my research area as possible, as well as related areas of my major, and also get closer to securing a place in one of my top grad schools. The fact that I'm aware of this is more depressing than not; I just hope it's worth the price.
