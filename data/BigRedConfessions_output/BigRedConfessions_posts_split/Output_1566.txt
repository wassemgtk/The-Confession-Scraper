To people who post long meaningful/political confessions on here -- why don't you start a blog? I don't mean this in a derogatory way, I mean it seriously. Your confession will be seen by a few Cornellians on here and in a few weeks will be deleted. Wouldn't you rather it was seen by more people in a more relevant context, and stayed somewhere for as long as you wanted it to? You probably spent 20 minutes or more on some of the confessions I've seen on here. And there is some really deep, moving, significant, existential stuff. You have an above average brain, if you have these thoughts, put them out there.
