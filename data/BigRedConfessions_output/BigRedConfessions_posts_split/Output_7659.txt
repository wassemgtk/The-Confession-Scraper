I feel stuck. I have no real friends and I don't know where to go to find new ones. Everyone seems to have found their own clique and I am left alone. I eat almost every single meal alone. I don't get along with my roommates. I don't know what to do. I feel so alone. Clubs don't help me make friends. I can't make friends in classes. How do I make friends? What can I do? I feel so lost and confused! How is everyone else making so many friends so fast? How do I jump start my social life?
