I became close with this one girl in a class this semester. She is not the usual stick skinnies the media upholds, but she honestly is one of the most beautiful girls I've seen on campus. She emits light every morning; her personality is just impeccable. Meeting her finally made me realize that I don't have to starve myself to be pretty. It is really about what's inside--the attitude and confidence. Because hey, who is to say that some meat isn't hot? Be proud, ladies. Skinny or fat, who the fuck cares. We are all absolutely gorgeous inside & out <3
