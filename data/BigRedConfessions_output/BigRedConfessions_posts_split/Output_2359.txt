after going to take back the night, I have to say: no. I will not stop mentioning it. I don't know who it is that you assaulted, but how the hell do you have the nerve to tell me not to talk about it? You say I don't know the full picture, but I heard you talking to your family admitting it after you were confronted about it. You sexually assaulted a girl, and I'm not going to pretend it didn't happen when people ask why I don't talk to you anymore. Best thing to happen to me since coming here was changing rooms so that I would no longer have you as a roommate.
