I honestly think Cornell should have a dating site/matchmaking sight. Reading these confessions and through my own experiences, I see that there are so many missed connections here on campus. People say that all the guys/girls are the same but that's because they haven't had the opportunity to meet someone who is different to them. I may be a hopeless romantic, but I feel like everyone has a match (whether it's on this campus or not) and more matches could be made or chances at love could be had with a legit Cornell dating site with no stigma attached, something less dirty than Tinder for people who are actually looking for something more (and it seems like a lot of us are).
