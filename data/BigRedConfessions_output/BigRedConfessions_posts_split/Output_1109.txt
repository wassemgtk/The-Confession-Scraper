To you, all of you: I love you. I love everything about you - your silly nuances, the way you express your love, your anger, your hurt. I love your skin color. I love you because you're black or white or tan or beige or brown. I love your sexuality, even if you don't know yet what it is. I even love your virginity, and your open sexual expression. I love that you feel sadness because it means you feel. I love your ugliness, your beauty, in and out. I love your intellect, your common sense, your occasional dingy-ness. I love that you're experiencing the best and worst of Cornell and life. I love your hunger for more. I love that miss the people you love. I love that you are energetic and want to change the world. I love that you're lazy and just wanna watch Netflix and Chill. I love your sincerity, your passion, your confusion, your openness. I love who you are and I love that you want to evolve on your you-ness. I love you. I hope you love me too.
