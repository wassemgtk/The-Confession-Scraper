I need advice. I'm a freshman trying to figure out housing for next year. I've found a couple of cheap apartments. Or I could live on west. Part of me would love to live alone, but I am very introverted and I'm afraid I won't have any friends. But I'm living in a dorm now and I still spend every night in my room doing HW/watching TV/reading alone. My parent were pushing me to live on west because it will be more social. But I got a bad housing lottery slot and don't have anyone who want to block with me. I'm constantly stressed out that I should be more social, but the truth is, I'm somewhat happy to just be alone. I hate small talk and I've never able to connect with anybody. I have a number of acquaintances but I don't have any friends. Is it bad to live alone and just continue to be in my own little bubble? I want to make the lifelong friends everybody else makes in college. I just don't know how.
