I just got an email from my advising dean saying that I am not in good academic standing because of my grades.  I have to submit a statement explaining why I suck and what I'm going to do to suck less in the future.  I'm a senior.  Is anyone else in this same situation... it's killing me on the inside.  I feel alienated, alone, scared, confused, and above all, disappointed in myself.  I don't know how I can get through this.
