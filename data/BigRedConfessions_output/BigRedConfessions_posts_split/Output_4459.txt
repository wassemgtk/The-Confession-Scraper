I don't know what's wrong with me anymore. I'm trying my best to suppress these feelings I have for you--just like I've done a countless number of times when dealing with my petty infatuations of certain, select members of the opposite gender. But this time...It's so damn hard to concentrate with you running laps in the twisted labyrinth of my mind. Being a secret sex addict, I tried to just masturbate and lust my way to freedom. But I can't even get it up. It feels...sinful, wrong. I'm ashamed to even look at those websites--websites that might as well have bookmarked or made my homepage (LOL). For those of you who've had these...stirrings of the heart...is this normal? Is there anyway to quash these attractions and just go on with my business and focus on my work? Either I'm beginning to fall for her or I'm seriously mentally ill. Please help me Confessions. How do you kill love?
