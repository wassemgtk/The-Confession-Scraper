My boyfriend can't get me off. And I keep telling myself that it's probably we're not having sex. I don't know how right that is. I don't plan on having sex with him anytime soon because of my own personal philosophy. And that fact that he understands and respects makes him all the more special. I know sex isn't everything in a relationship. Yet it still worries me. What if it's not just me?
