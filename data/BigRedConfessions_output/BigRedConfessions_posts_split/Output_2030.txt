Here's a story a few peeps could probably relate to. I used to date this fun, beautiful, and ridiculously intelligent girl in high school. Our relationship lasted for a solid amount of time and it was a damn good one. When we went to college we ended up breaking up and I felt miserable for a long time. Being the girl she is she found a long term boyfriend almost immediately who seem(s)(ed), in all honesty, like a much better guy than me. Of course I felt jealous, I felt cheated, I felt bitter and I felt lonely. She would call and with the kindest of intentions she would console me and try to make me feel better all while making it clear that we had gone our separate ways. And I loved talking to her, but after every FaceTime, every message, I would feel like complete and absolute shit. Because I still wanted her back. I became so focused on the loss of her that my reality became muddled by wistful fantasies and unfounded hopes. And I'm still not over it. Do I know I'm only making myself more unhappy by focusing on past regrets? Of course. Do I know that what I feel is morally objectionable? Absolutely. I tell myself that I should just be happy for her happiness, but I'm no saint. I, whether I want to or not, live and feel for myself over everything. So what do I do? Do beat my emotions until they feel what I want them to feel? Take it in stride, smoke a cigar, and admire the beauty of life? I often wish that I would have, by chance, slipped into a friend group that had picked me up and given me a community to be at home in as she had. In my suffering I had chosen to isolate myself and in my bitterness I had decided to blame my surroundings. Do I regret that too? Yah, I do. But my life is my own and things are as they are. Do I have a resolution? No, not really. But I'll be damned if I don't make myself happy this next year. Cornell, I'm coming for you.
