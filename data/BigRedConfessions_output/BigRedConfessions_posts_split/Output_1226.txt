Of all the things I think about people judging me for whenever I step outside of my dorm room, I now have to add to that list the thought of people thinking I'm a disgusting human being when I walk barefoot to the kitchen three doors down the hall to get some water. 

I think it’s reasonable to argue that at Cornell you will encounter more germs on door handles and classroom desks and chairs than you will encounter bacteria on communal floors. And the people such as yourself who are deeply concerned with this particular aspect of hygiene and the incredibly small potential for foot fungus will be wearing shoes to reduce their exposure even further. But you don’t hear sh** about the prevalence of microbes and foot problems on campus. You hear a lot more about the flu and the cold, and you’re being exposed to those viruses every day when you share classrooms and educational spaces with a countless number of other students. And those illnesses, unlike your common foot ailment, have the potential to completely keep you from fulfilling your responsibilities and coursework for a week or more. But despite the huuuge costs of airborne illnesses, most of us don’t turn our noses at people for not using purell on every doorknob, we don’t call them disgusting for placing their bare hands on top of the desks. 

So if someone walking barefoot is not going to negatively impact your own health, why be bothered? Feelings of disgust towards things like bare feet are motivated more by cultural norms than they are by a rational cost-benefit analysis. Even if you have a visceral and upsetting emotional response, it's pretty easy to avoid looking at someone’s feet anyway. Try looking them in the eye instead, strike up a conversation maybe, and have an emotionally rewarding experience as opposed to passing inane judgement. Unquantifiable disgust like this crops up among people arguing against gender neutral bathrooms. Disgust like this has also informed arguments against public displays of affection among non-heterosexual and inter-racial couples. It’s better for the people around you, as well as better for yourself as a human being, to think critically about what things you find gross and why you feel that way. Try not to close off your mind, even when it comes to something as simple as feet.
