Take that Bloomberg and Feinstein.....Imma buy as many boxes of Girl Scout cookies as I want and I will eat as many as I want. I know you tried to ban sugary drinks in the past, but you're not getting anywhere near my stash of over 100 boxes of cookies. Every time the Girl Scouts are around campus I buy as many boxes as I can carry back to my apartment.....It's the only hope. Let the markets demand these delectable cookies.....that way the factories will keep on supplying them. Yum. :P
