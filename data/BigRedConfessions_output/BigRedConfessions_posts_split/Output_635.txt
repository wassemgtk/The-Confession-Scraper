Sometimes I feel as though my life was like the movie Friends with Benefits during my time at Cornell, although I never actually had sex with my friend if that makes sense. I lost my friend because I opened up myself too much to them and told them how I felt about everything. :( All I do now is travel to forget the past and explore new places and meet new people and see beautiful landmarks and stuff all over the country on my journeys. I get high when I see something new in the world around me.
