I feel like I'm starting to realize that my friends all secretly hate me.

I've been going through a kind of rough time lately. My family back home is falling apart. I feel like I have to suddenly be everyone's rock; perhaps now I'm cracking. I don't know if that's made me somehow act out in ways that have made me easier to dislike. Maybe it's a coincidence.

A friend of mine went on a whole rant about how much I suck about a week ago. Ever since then, there's been this weird, bubbling tension between us. Another friend said that I piss them off every time I open my mouth. I realize I'm kind of the common denominator in this situation. I know that I'm not always the easiest person to get along with. I guess I can be kind of argumentative. I just feel really tired.

It's just been kind of tough. I don't feel like I'm getting a lot of support. I guess I should probably just ask them what I do that pisses me off. I just feel raw inside. What happened to the times where we made each other stronger? Did they ever exist? I wish I knew.
