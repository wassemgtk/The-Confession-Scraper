I do not know where I have gone wrong . I am leaving my current firm to join another , but needed some advice from a former colleague.I mentioned that I was a little anxious and was looking to talk to someone who can help . It was fine until suddenly this what they told me - do not think I can give any advice because I believe you are looking for emotional support and am married . It is not appropriate . You should talk to a mentor.This made me feel very lonely. Why the marriage of someone being a problem? All I needed was a little help in the process / what to expect. I think these things can be extremely sensitive . I 'm new to the country and needed some support , for sure. ( The person in question had left a while ago ) . May be Asians are not your friends ... :(
