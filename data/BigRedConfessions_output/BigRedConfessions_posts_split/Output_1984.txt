Fuck me, I really can't pull my thoughts together.  What you did was exactly what I had hoped would happen all four years of high school (and my two years at Cornell).  Someone actually asking me to hang out.  Someone banging on my fucking door, asking me to hang out.  What I could not tell you to your face is that I have spent the entire summer thus far doing nothing but watching Minecraft Let's Plays, playing (and beating Skyrim), and watching porn.  I was working for my dad, but I fucked up a job and now no one in my family is talking to me.  Seriously, my mom won't even let me have any of the dinner she makes.  I thought my depression was bad at school.  Before the cock up earlier this week, I had no face-to-face human contact with no one outside my family.  Now I don't even have their shitty company.  I alienated all the people I could even casually talk to here in town long ago.  
I don't remember how this started.  I don't remember why I started feeling this way.  Now it keeps itself going: "high achieving" student in high school doing shitty at Cornell.  "Physics major" who has lost all interest in physics (and everything else, but more on that later).  Quit working for my dad and now listless when I should be doing research.  Alone and friendless when I should be firming up who I want to be and going on adventures with people.  Finding a group I would feel right singing "The Parting Glass" to when my days at Cornell come to a close and we part ways.
Yeah, fuck you, people who say I should go out and make friends.  Besides the fact that I have not had a serious deep conversation since my freshman year here, I've lost my interest in everything.  There was a time when I would spend weeks reading fantasy books.  Rings, Names, Wind...I would read great stories and think deep things.  Now, well, like I said.  Nothing.  Even what I watch is more just something to look at.  I'm obviously not engaging.  They just distract me, make me feel less alone.  I can't imagine how talking to someone in person would play out.  I have nothing to talk about.  Judging by how I was talking to my sister before the falling out, I have a hard time thinking about or reacting to things.  I've got nothing.  Even this, something I'm writing and can dwell on for a while I am having trouble with.  I don't want to talk about depression.  I want to fucking move on from this and feel better.  Seriously.  But that  
I've burned my letter marking me as one of the top seven students of my graduating class.  I've ripped up my edition of The Lord of the Rings.  I've smashed my Kindle and shredded my Star Wars books.  Because what have these things got me?  Fuck all.  I went on a long bike ride today without my helmet with the hope that I could find a nice large truck to will myself to dart out in front off and get hit.  Fuck this.
  I couldn't find my Cornell acceptance letter,  that I would burn with lots and lots of gasoline.  Because Cornell has left me isolated and alone.  Fuck.  Me.  I suck.
