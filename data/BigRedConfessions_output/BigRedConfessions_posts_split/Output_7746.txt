I need to do this. I have a huge crush on you. I've felt this way about you since last semester. You are such a beautiful person and everything about you is beautiful: your hair, your eyes, your smile, your personality. Just seeing you makes my day brighter. You probably don't feel this way about me though. I know there are probably several other guys who you would prefer over me. It's just so hard for me to compete with them. I'll never be the guy who a girl looks at and goes "he's pretty cute/hot." I tried to muster up the courage to ask you out, but i just couldn't do it. Whoever ends up dating you in the future, they need to know that they are a pretty lucky guy. Happy Valentines Day to you. I hope it was good for you...
