I had my ANSC 1100 dissection labs today. Though everyone was talking about this TA handling the class, I never thought he would impress me. In just 2 hours, he explained everything that I tried to learn this semester in a simple and elegant way. He is awesome !!, funny and very very smart, but I am afraid to talk to him *sigh* ***in love****
