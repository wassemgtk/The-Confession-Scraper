I just want to know what you thought of me this whole time. I'm not here anymore and you texted me that you'd miss me but I was too scared, like always, to show my true emotions to you. Please try again. Please. I want to tell you that I loved every minute I spent with you, even though it was just for a year, even though we never tried to be anything more than casual friends. I just want to know if you thought of me as a good friend, if you trusted me with yourself. I don't care if you didn't have romantic feelings for me, which was never the point. I just wish I knew that you valued me. I hope you'll forgive me for being too weak to tell you my feelings when you gave me the chance. I regret it so much.
