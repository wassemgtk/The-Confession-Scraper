Two years ago I was 70 pounds and on the verge of death from my eating disorder. Today my body is ruined, there's fat in all the wrong places, i have no shape and my metabolism is shot. Every time someone tells me to hit the gym or tells me I need to lose a good 50 pounds, I end up crying shortly after. No one knows what is really going on with me, they just think "another fat cow that's too lazy to eat a vegetable or work out". This isn't true, but no one will ever know, they'll only believe the judgment they make from looking at me.
