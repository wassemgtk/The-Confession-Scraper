I always used to hate how big my thighs were- I would always feel uncomfortable putting on jeans and I would *never* wear leggings because I was too self-conscious. But this break I've started to weight train and it turns out these thunder thighs allow me do to some pretty heavy lifting! I never thought of my thick legs as a source of strength, but now I'm really happy about it! Love your bodies guys <3
