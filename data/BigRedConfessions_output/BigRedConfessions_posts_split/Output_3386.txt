I don't know if the #fightthefee video is supposed to get me riled up or empathize with my fellow peers, but all it did was make me sympathize with Skorton. As someone who is on a shit ton of financial aid, I equally protest the fee but some people here are such assholes. There had to be a better way to go about it than make comedic gestures behind his back or speak over him as he tries to answer questions or snicker at every word. Maybe someday we'll have a president that can satisfy the demands of all 14,393+ students but until that day comes, we can at least respect the president we do have even if we might not agree with him.

So Skorton, if you reading this, I apologize on behalf of every rude "protestor".
