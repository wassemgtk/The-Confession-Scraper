I dropped out of Cornell and went into Marines a few years ago because I realized that Cornell was really full of shit and I was not getting anything out of the education here. After joining I have obtained a positive outlook on life, became more physically and mentally fit, and was able to build up my life and live the "American Dream." I now own a house and in a few months I am getting married to my beautiful girlfriend of two years. I can look to the future in a positive manner, knowing that my friends and I are contributing to the safety of this country. It saddens to see many negative posts on this site, pertaining to suicide or self pity. I wish I can offer the same advice and experiences I have had to these people and let them know that Cornell is not everything. You can do well without a college degree and be happy. In fact, I am getting a college degree in engineering as I am writing this, so enlisting is not the end. The school's name does not really mean much in the greater sense when looking for jobs. The Marines have allowed me to get a degree in a more relaxed setting. I work as an electrician now and the skills I am obtaining will help me gain the experience necessary to transition to the civilian sector in the years to come as an electrical engineer. When I was a student at Cornell, I've noticed the professors were lacking and often care more about research than teaching. Students at Cornell are not necessarily smarter than students elsewhere, because many lack hands-on and practical knowledge. Learning theory is fine, but without practice, you are not going to make it in the real world outside of academia. I've noticed that some of my buddies who had a hard time in high school enlisted and gained a better work ethic than even my peers at Cornell had in the military. The military will keep you busy and it's a life changing experience. So if you are struggling and want a change in your routine, consider enlisting or doing something else like I did and maybe it can save your life like it did mine. I think life is far more important than dying over some bullshit school. Anyways Semper Fi to any Marines ROTC students at Cornell! I respect you and your passion a lot.
