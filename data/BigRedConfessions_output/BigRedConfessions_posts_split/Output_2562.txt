I'm fucked up.  And I've been fucked over.  Which has fucked me up more.  But recently I've worked to become more stable and to understand how my interactions with others affect them and myself.  I've gotten a new boyfriend and I really like him and he seems to reciprocate my feelings, and, honestly, he's probably more mature and decent than most of the other guys I've seen.  But because these sorts of things have fucked me over so terribly in the past, I'm more than a little terrified.  I don't know how much more of that I can honestly take

Part of me thinks that it's silly to post this as anonymous confession though. Pretty sure most of my friends will spot me in this immediately.  Especially since they've heard it before.  But I don't know.  It's somewhat therapeutic anyways.
