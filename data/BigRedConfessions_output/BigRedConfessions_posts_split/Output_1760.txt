I'm usually an upbeat energetic and positive person, but after getting rejected from a 2 jobs, rejected by a girl, passed over in an audition (which I'm so salty about because it was straight nepotism), and just overall thrown to the curbside by my friends all in the last week, I'm really having a hard time keeping myself going. I'll be okay, but i don't like this. Anyone have some pointers on getting over a series of frustrating events?
