I'm such an idiot. I didn't notice the message on the coffee cup until late that evening. I was so sleep deprived in the morning I don't even remember who you are...Missed Connection. If I happen to be on line again, please rewrite the message!!! I'm pretty clueless when it comes to these types of things haha.
