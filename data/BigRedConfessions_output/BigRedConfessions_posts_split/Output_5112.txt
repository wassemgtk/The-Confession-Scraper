Even though I had a shitty year this year as a freshman which includes my subpar gpa (2.5ish), I finally had an opportunity open up again after continuously being rejected by anything and everything.  I feel both lucky and happy that I can finally do something that is worthwhile. Cuz I mean... I was rejected even from bullshit like clubs. But ehh... now I am definitely putting myself at par with everyone else. Move out the way bitches!
