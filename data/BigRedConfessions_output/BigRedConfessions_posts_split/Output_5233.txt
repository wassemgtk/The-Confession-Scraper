I'm not even sure if we were even dating, but that hasn't stopped me from missing you. I want to keep in touch over the summer, because we're first and foremost friends, but I can feel you pulling away. If we can't even maintain a cross-country friendship, how on earth can we even consider entering into a relationship when we start at different schools come August?
