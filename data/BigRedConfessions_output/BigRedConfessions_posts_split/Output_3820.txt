I've known him through a club for less than 3 months but I'm falling for him hard. He and I are like the same person, we're just so similar, and I've never felt so comfortable or like myself around anyone. There's never a dull moment or more than a minute without a joke or a laugh when we hang out. The problem is he chose to date another girl from the same club who I'm very good friends with. She tells me all the details and I offer legitimately good advice because I am happy for her. But the whole time I just feel so sad that he didn't choose me, and now every time I'm in a room with the two of them, I feel so uncomfortable, almost on the verge of crying. Admittedly both of them are actually really good friends of mine, I just wish I could drive this sadness away.
