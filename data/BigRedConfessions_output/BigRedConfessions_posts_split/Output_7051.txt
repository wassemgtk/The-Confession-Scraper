"My roommate is such a psycho and is driving me completely crazy.
I have never hated anybody more.
Not only does she act immature, she is completely deluded and things she's the best thing since the invention of sliced bread. She is condescending and arrogant, when she has absolutely no reason to be. Even worse, she doesn't get that I don't like her; she still tells me all her petty problems, problems she creates herself just to get attention. Please get it through your head. I really don't like you and I really don't care. I just hate conflict which is why I put up with this shit.
I am literally counting the days when I'm free."
