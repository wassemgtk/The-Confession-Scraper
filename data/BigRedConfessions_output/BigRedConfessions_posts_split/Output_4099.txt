Last year I was depressed, lonely, and hopeless. I contemplated killing myself, but I got help and managed to ride it out. Now, I'm dating and in love with an amazing girl and I don't think I've ever been happier. To the depressed people reading this, I know how you feel and please don't do anything drastic because it does get better!!!
