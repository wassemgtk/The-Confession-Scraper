I can honestly remember the first time my mother told me to stop wishing that I would grow up faster stop wishing that I would be able to drive and stop wishing to become an adult, because your childhood is something you never get back.... I can remember when I was told by my older friends not to rush through high school because it is the last time you will be able to live in the blissfully ignorant world and not have real responsibilities. Now, as I stare my junior year in the eye, the scary half way point of my college period, the "best four years of my life", I wish I could really go back. I would give anything to go back to that first awkward day when I moved into my freshmen dorm. I would kill to be stuck in my shitty OL group with my boring OL leader. I would love to be awkwardly running around College town, not knowing which frats were "cool", just looking for a sick time to be had. What I have realized is that these four years are priceless. They are experiences I will remember for the rest of my life, these are friendships I will carry on forever, and these are people who will be as close to me as family. I guess what Im trying to get at here is I wish I stopped and just enjoyed the moment in my previous two years at Cornell, and life in general, but i sure intend to do this more often in the years to come. Cornell, through all the finals, "study weeks" and shit that you have given me [and will give me], these are years and experiences I wouldn't trade for anything else. Although finals week is an experience most dread, I know that in a few short weeks I would love nothing less than to be here at my desk studying my ass off, running on no sleep, and having drank far too many cups of coffee because this is place like no other, in a time of my life I will remember forever.
