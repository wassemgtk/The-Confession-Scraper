This whole year I've been telling myself I want a relationship with someone, that I'm ready to start building a foundation to spend the rest of my life with someone, but now that that chance is actually here I keep looking for reasons to run away from it because I'm secretly scared. I also can't stop thinking I'd be tying myself down too early, losing opportunities if I meet someone better, which I hate myself for even thinking. Plus then I'd feel guilty flirting. Oh, and there's the complication that this guy is my brother's best friend, so if we do date and it doesn't work out that's all kinds of awkward, plus it'd be long distance while I'm still in college. On the other hand we're already great friends and can talk about anything. He's shown he's willing to be there for me pretty much no matter what, so honestly what's stopping me?
