I never really have to try to get a decent grade at this school, so I don't. While everyone else is busy complaining about a really hard test, all I can think is how hard and tedious it must be to have to apply yourself academically. Sometimes I feel guilty for getting an A on a final after 90 minutes of rushed memorization the night before, but I get over it.
