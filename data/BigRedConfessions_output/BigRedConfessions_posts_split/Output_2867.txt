I know I shouldn’t have prejudice with fat people but I kind of do. I was fat once: 5’5 tall and weighed 180 pounds as a teenager. Now I am 5’11 and weigh 160, with lots of gym hours and food rehab. 

Anyway, I know each case should be treated individually and some people are quite happy the way they are. I know it’s wrong and I shouldn’t think like this, but I do. I needed to write this somewhere. Thanks Cornell Confessions.
