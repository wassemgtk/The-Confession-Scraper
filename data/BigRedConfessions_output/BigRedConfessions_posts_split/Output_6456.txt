To the girl who saw my bleeding knee on the bus and asked if I was okay, thank you. Sorry if I seemed out of it. The thing was my knee wasn't too bad, but I kinda twisted my ankle too and was thinking out how all the walking I needed to do was going play out for the day. I really did appreciate your empathy even if it didn't show. Never change.
