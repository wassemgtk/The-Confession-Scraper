For the last four years I have been in love with a girl. She's the most beautiful girl, with a pretty smile and the kindest heart. However, she claims she's a lesbian, and though I've given her my heart and soul, even crying in front of her, professing my love through my tears and mucus that ran out of my nose, she still hasn't shown the same attraction towards me. But I know that she's straight, she has to be. Why would she even bother talking to someone like me? I don't want to sound entitled, but I've done so much for her, that she should at least go out with me for a girly drink. I want her to put away the flannel and the hiking boots and for one night just put on a nice dress for me and have a good time with me. I am sure that she'll see that she can be attracted to me, even if I am not a girl.
