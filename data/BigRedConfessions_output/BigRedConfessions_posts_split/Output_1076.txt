Shoutouts to Sport Taekwondo at Cornell, the greatest family I could ask for! I was a bit apprehensive to try it at first but the team is hilarious, wonderful, and we kick butt outside and inside the ring. Doing taekwondo this semester was the best decision I've made here, and I can't wait to go to Brown this weekend!

You all are incredible teammates. Cornell Fight Team!
