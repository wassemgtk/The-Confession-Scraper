I know I said I wouldn't, but I did. I'm so sorry for fooling around with your sister. Virginities were taken, feelings were hurt, and lies were told. We never told you the truth about what happened that summer night I came to visit. I'm so sorry bro...I want to tell you so badly, but I know you'll just end up killing me for what I did. For what it's worth, I did show her a good time for the brief two days I spent up there. Maybe one day we could laugh about this over a pair of Heinekens? #bigdickproblems
