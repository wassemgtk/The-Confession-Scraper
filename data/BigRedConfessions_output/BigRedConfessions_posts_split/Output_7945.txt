"There are many people I failed. I didn't take care of myself, so preoccupied with helping others so that my problems didn't seem so bad. In doing so I got even worse, it eventually got to the point where I was of no help to anyone and even hurt some of the people around me.

If this sounds familiar to you, even if you're not the people I'm thinking of, may there be fortune in your future and the people in your life further enrich it. "
