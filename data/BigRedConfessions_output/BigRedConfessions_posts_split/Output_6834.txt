Everyone thinks I'm gay. I just don't agree that being macho and disrespectful to women is the main way a man can prove his manliness. I don't think being gay is a bad thing, far from it, I have mad respect for those who are confident enough to embrace their sexuality, but I'd rather not have women thinking I'm gay and me falling by default into the "gay best friend zone."
