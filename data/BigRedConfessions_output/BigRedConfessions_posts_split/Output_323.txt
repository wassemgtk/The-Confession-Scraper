I've been crying a lot over the last couple of days. I have no idea what's going on. I'm a guy, and I rarely cry, maybe once or twice a year. But the last couple of days, I've teared up maybe 10 times just over regular things that I've perceived as dramatic or sad or emotional... Must be a hormonal response or something, no idea. But it's not bad...
