I'm trying so hard to forget you, but every day, I come across at least one thing that reminds me of you. We were so good together. If only we met earlier. If only I don't have to graduate in a month. Goddammit I just want to move on. You probably don't even think of me anymore. But no matter how many guys I meet, you are the only one in my mind.
