I went on a date and then nearly had sex with a married man. If I hadn't been suspicious and looked up who he was, I inadvertently could have played a part in destroying a marriage and crushing the family stability of a toddler. I confronted the man about it, gave him some serious life advice and got him some help. 

I feel dead inside now. Absolutely dead. My faith in humanity has never, ever hit such a low nadir. That was my first date after leaving my husband. I thought about killing myself briefly but instead I've decided to stop dating for a while and instead volunteer for various ecological efforts. I'm just going to remove myself from humanity for a while and hope I decide to come back after healing a bit. Right now, I just hate everyone and everything about this fucked up institution, culture and civilization.
