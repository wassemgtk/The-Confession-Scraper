My girlfriend and I just broke up. To everyone else I pretend that this isn't bothering me, but to be honest this is killing me inside. I know this was entirely my fault, and I wish I hope that I can change for you. But right now, you are the only thing I think about; the only person I see in my mind before and during sleep. How can I still have a conversation with you without you speaking the same way you used to. How can I tell you that I love you knowing that there's a chance you no longer feel the same way. I know this probably makes me seem like a little bitch, but I honestly don't care. This is the girl with whom I see myself growing old and starting a family. This is the woman that helped me in so many ways, amd is the closest friend I have ever had. I wish there's a way I can fix this somehow later on. I just hope that "later on" is sooner than later. Please don't lose the feelings that I still have for you.
