At this point, I dread going back to Cornell more than anything. Being home over break let me finally get away from all of these ridiculous obligations that I'm not even sure how I got into. I feel no desire to do well in school or succeed in any of my other activities, and being in Ithaca just consistently feels like a fucking nightmare I won't be able to leave for the next three years. Basically, all of my motivation is gone. I just don't see the point of it all when everything is really so ridiculously arbitrary.
