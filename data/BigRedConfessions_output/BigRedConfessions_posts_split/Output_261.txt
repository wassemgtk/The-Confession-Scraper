Before I become friends with anyone, including those at Cornell, I run background checks by interviewing them about their personal life non-chalanty, and by checking local, state, and federal databases where they have resided in the past to see if anything shows up. I like to be safe than sorry. I like to collect people's fingerprints too without their consent and without them noticing, by giving them things to handle and return to me. I have never failed by checking people out before associating with them. It helps avoid potential safety concerns in the long term. I know that it worked for me when I met my girlfriend and as a result we have been together for seven years already.
