Coming to Cornell was a bad idea.

I transferred here from a school where my GPA was kickass, and here my first semester GPA was a 2.8 and my second semester GPA won't be all that better. I'm pre-vet; at least, I used to be. Now, I don't think any vet school will accept me.

I study so hard, I push myself to the limit, and I go to bed almost every day thinking, "This was a mistake."
