There have been a couple people on cornell confessions who I really relate to. I love my boyfriend and have been trying to show him how I feel ( by being there for him through finals week,etc), hoping that he felt the same way and would be there for me. Instead, he says he would be there, but then something always comes up and he bails. I was hoping that he would meet me half way. Why are you in a relationship with me if you don't really care? I just want to be loved. Is that too much to ask?
