I hate Halloween. As a woman, it used to be a day when girls could dress up as their favorite fictional character. Now, females are expected to dress as some type of debased sex slave fantasy character. Whatever, I get it, I am super lame for expressing these thoughts. Every sorority whore will be dressed in her bra and underwear & I am just jealous cause I don't have a body like that. Wrong, as a former model (which is a justification I don't think I need to even provide, but because it will silence those sororstitutes & frat-hoes and frat-bros who are assuming I am ugly ass), I hate to see that since a young age Halloween encourages females to dress as Princesses & in their adulthood to dress as hobags. It seems like a trivial thing - it's one day, it's just for fun, but it's a national phenomenon. It's subtle things like this that loose the fight against women's equality all the time. #HeisforShe
