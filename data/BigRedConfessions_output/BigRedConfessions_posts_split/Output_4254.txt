I have several confessions and i just need to get them all out because it's bothering me . 

1. I haven't gotten asked out in person since middle school 

2. I lost my virginity to a guy i met online

3. I have never gotten flowers before.

4. i feel lonely all the time

5. all my friends pretty much left/ graduated

6. I'm super awkward and don't know how to change. 

This is all. good night!
