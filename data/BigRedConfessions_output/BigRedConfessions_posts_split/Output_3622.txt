I will finally say, though anonymously, how I feel. 

I feel alone... it's my fault. I have convinced myself that as I explore my sexuality, it's better if I am away from others. I don't want to hurt anyone, nor I want anyone to hurt me. That's why it has taken me so long to decide for one or the other, or for both. I don't want to go gay, and then regret it. I don't want to go straight, and regret as well. I don't want to go bi, and then have the social status of the guy that likes both because then I will get hit by both genders, and I don't want to have the need to reject/hurt someone just because I'm not interested anymore. I just hope I can finally get over this feeling; this thought that takes much space of my mind. I also hope I go for what I feel the most identified with, because once I come out, I can't go in.
