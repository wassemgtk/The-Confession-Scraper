"I feel for all the large chested ladies on here who struggle with bras because I'm familiar with them too, but in a different way. 
I'm a 38A. 
Victoria Secret doesn't make that size. ""Wear a 36B,"" they say, ""It's your sister size."" Bullshit. I have a perpetual gap in the cups and the band is gets worn out too fast. 
No one carries this size really, and it definitely never goes on sale (to the same extent of ""average"" bras at least). My best fitting bra is one I got off Amazon from China.
