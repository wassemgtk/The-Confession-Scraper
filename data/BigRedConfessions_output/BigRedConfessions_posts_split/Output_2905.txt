I'm on a prolonged leave of absence from Cornell for mental health and grade issues. I haven't told my parents and can no longer depend on them for tuition money because they're about to get divorced and my dad's basically kicking my brothers and I out of his life to take care of the whore he cheated with. I've begun working and will do so for the next year and a half until I re-enroll. But credit-wise I have at least a year and a half's worth of tuition to pay. I've done the calculations and I won't have enough to pay for all of it. I don't know if Cornell will give me enough aid and even if they do, I know I'm going to feel really bad if I accept it since I'd be depriving some other well-deserving kid of an opportunity. I hate what I've become and how far I've fallen. I used to be a good student that showed some competence for engineering--12 AP's, high SAT's, decent GPA for two years in college. Far from a genius. But at least competent at learning. I'm so deep in this pit I've dug for myself. I'll never be able to take care of mom or rise high in society. To make it all worse, I just keep wondering...how did I ever let things get this bad?
