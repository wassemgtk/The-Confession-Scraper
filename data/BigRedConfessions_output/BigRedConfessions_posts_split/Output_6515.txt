that scratching the chalkboard with your finger nails sound of a girl screaming is so f-ing annoying. trying to sleep early with hearing that f-ing sound outside just makes me want to go outside and f-ing slap the chick that's doing it. the guy you're with def. doesnt find u more attractive when u do that. the fly you are running from will not eat u alive or cause some fatal disease. there's no f-in reason to do it. for gods sake. stfu.
