Guys, I need advice! What do you do when you send an email to a professor requesting permission to register for one of their courses, and they just don't even respond to you? I'm pretty sure it wasn't an issue with the email..I was very polite and very formal, and explained the reasons why I wanted to take the course, my interest in the subject, etc. How do I proceed? (Help!!!)
