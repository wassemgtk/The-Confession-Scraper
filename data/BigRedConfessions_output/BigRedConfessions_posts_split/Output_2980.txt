I am a freshman and I girl. I had an absolutely terrible first semester at Cornell, and I don't know where I would be if I didn't join a sorority. I know a lot of people bash on them, but I don't know where I would be if I didn't have a support system this semester. I know there are a lot of negative aspects associated with sororities, but they aren't as bad as one would think. It has been the best choice I have made since coming to Cornell. Cornell is a stressful place, and if you don't feel like you have a support system, it's hard.
