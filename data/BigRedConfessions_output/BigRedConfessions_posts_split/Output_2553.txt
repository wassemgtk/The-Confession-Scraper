I don't think you know how much you affect me. You can't understand how I feel; not just you though -- everyone. I have so many things built up and building up  inside of me and I can't help but refuse to let anyone peek in. For as long as I remember I've sat back and let life stitch my mouth shut -- and I want to say that I'd rip them out at the sight of you, but it hurts. Now I'm just quiet. And not with you.
