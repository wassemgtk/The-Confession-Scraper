So one of my classes was unexpectedly cancelled for next semester and all the other slots are filled. This is so unprofessional on Cornell's part. I get that "unforeseen circumstances" can come up but it seems so incredibly inconsiderate to not even give students another option and leave them on their own. I spent a lot of time on my schedule and because of one class, everything is fucked up.
