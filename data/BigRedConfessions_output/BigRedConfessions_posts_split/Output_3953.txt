"I went out with someone earlier this year, and well.... let's just say he dumped me for another girl. It took me a while to finally get over him, but with time and lots of sad feelings, I got over him. I recently started to develop feelings for another person, but today I learned that he ... likes someone ... 
The first time I heard that he liked somebody, I was honestly surprisingly depressed. This guy is much better than the previous guy I went out with. He is much sweeter, kinder, has strong moral values, and is funny too. When I finally thought I found someone, I find out he likes someone else. (By a lot too...)

Why is it that all the people I like have feelings for other people? I hate liking someone. I HATE it. I am always getting hurt in the end and I have no more hope for love. I am never looking for love again. I want to avoid it. I will make friendships, but I hate love. It's too painful and unfair ... "
