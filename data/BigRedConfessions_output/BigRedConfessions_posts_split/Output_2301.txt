I'm not right for this place.  I got into Cornell pretty randomly and decided to come because it was the most prestigious name on my list of acceptances.  I didn't know what I wanted to do with my life and I figured maybe I'd find that out while I'm here.  Maybe I'd discover my passion for music or biology or management, I thought.  I was apprehensive but I went along with it for two years because I didn't really have an alternative.  I've been told my entire life that college will be the defining factor in my life, that a degree will pave the path to success, that my time here will prepare me to make a real difference in the world.  

The thing is, I don't care about making a difference in the world.  I've spent my entire life trying to have as little impact on people as possible.  I don't want to be an actor in the spectacle of life.  I just want to sit in the audience and let it all soak in.  I want to be able to up and vanish like a fart in the wind and leave no trace of my existence.  I want to put on a good playlist and drive along the California coast, and at night I'd sleep in the back of my car on the beach, listening to the waves tumble onto the sand and retreat again.  And in the morning I'd retreat again to some other location--maybe up the coast, maybe across the country--that has no memory of me, and this is how I'd live.  It's no investment banking or here-I-am-to-change-the-world career that most Cornell students seem to covet, but it's what I dream of every night.
