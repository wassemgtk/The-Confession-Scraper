I realize how extremely fortunate I am, and am generally a very happy person, but it seems like loneliness is something that can bring literally anyone down. And while I'd love to meet a girl, not necessarily to date, but to just spend time and have fun with, it's been really tough to meet some. It's important to be able to be happy on your own though, so I'm working on it.
