"I once told you that I loved you. You gave me some bull excuse and continued to tell me all about your one night stands. You kept hurting me and then wondered why I seemed increasingly depressed and withdrawn. I have wasted the majority of my college years, the best years of my life, on you and you don't even realize or appreciate it. I want to tell you how horrible you've made my life but I still care too much to hurt you. One more semester and I might finally be free.
