"Arts Quad Guy,
Even though I think your crazy most of the time for sitting in the cold and snow in shorts, I really appreciated your smile today! A combination of the weather and personal problems put me in such a bad mood today, but for some reason your smile turned my day around. I never used to believe that small acts like a smile or holding a door for someone could actually affect people in a powerful way, but you changed my mind. Thanks for always being there to offer a smile and showing people that the world isn't always as bad as it seems. Keep doing what your doing cause you make a difference."
