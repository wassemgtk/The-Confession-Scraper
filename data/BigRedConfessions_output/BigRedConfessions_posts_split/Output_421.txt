I have a dislike of Priuses and many other imported "environmentally friendly" cars. I know as a Cornell MechE these cars suck when it comes to their transmissions and wheel bearing assemblies. I cannot wait until I am home in Ohio again so that I can roll coal with my brand new Chevy Silverado 3500HD with a 6.6L Turbo-Diesel V8 engine.
