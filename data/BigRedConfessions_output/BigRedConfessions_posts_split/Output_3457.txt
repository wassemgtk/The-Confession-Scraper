To the cute guy that lives in my building:
You're out of my league. That's painfully obvious to me. And yet, our eyes have a habit of meeting and when they meet, I can almost swear you feel the same magnetic pull towards me that I do towards you. But then I realize this is only wishful thinking on my part and quickly advert my eyes and scurry past in a vain attempt to minimize any further embarrassment. And, I can see how this could be misconstrued as me not being interested, but that is not the case. So I guess the point of this post is to say I like you but you make me nervous. And, if I am mistaken and the attraction is mutual, please let me know...
