I like to browse Cornell Confessions when I feel sad and depressed and meet people on here because most of them are losers and will be losers for life so it gives me more drive to meet and hang out with losers because I can feel better about myself and once I feel better I disconnect from them. It's the best therapy I can give myself and it only makes me stronger.
