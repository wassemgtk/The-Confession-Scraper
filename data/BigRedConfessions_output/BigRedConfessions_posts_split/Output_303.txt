"If it wasn't for my fear of death, I would have offed myself a long time ago. I continually fail everyone around me. Just the other day I spent several near-all-nighters to finish a problem set, and then, like the supreme idiot I am, I forgot to turn the problem set in! Someone should just end my life before I graduate as an engineer, so I don't end up blowing up innocent people who deserve to live much more than me.

Not to mention I fail in relationships as well. I am simply a well of negativity to all of my friends, and girls are repulsed by me or pity me. My family despises me as well, as they are forced to work overtime in shitty jobs just so that I can barely pass my classes. My only relief is cutting, as I can look at myself in the mirror and relish in causing pain to such a horrid individual. 

Today, a particularly rough day, I might just gather up the courage to jump in the gorge. It's not like anyone would care anyway."
