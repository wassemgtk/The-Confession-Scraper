To the nice people out there who care about others enough to respond to their confessions, thank you. I had written a confession recently at the absolute nadir of my semester. And it gave me hope to see people reach out to me, and lend a listening ear even when they didn't know me or had nothing to do with me. It takes real heart to do that. And even though, I couldn't scrape the nerve to actually talk to these people, I want them to know that I really appreciate their gesture. Just the thought that there is someone out there who cares about you without even knowing you, gave me the strength to pick my self up and stop feeling sorry for myself. My life is still the same but atleast I know I will get through this semester and then there is only one more to go. So thank you, all you kind people, who care enough to provide those words of encouragement and support.It meant a lot.
