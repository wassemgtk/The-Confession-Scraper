Because everyone speaks of this 50's shit, I have to say I like the guy who plays at Penn Station NY near the 1,2,3 train entrance at the end of the LIRR terminal walkway near the McDonald's. He's awesome whenever you hear Bobby Darin, Frank Sinatra, or The Temptations covers. Anyone with me or know what I am talking about all you city Cornellians? I cannot wait for Thanksgiving Break to be home again in the big city again. After all I love New York over this prairie. I had no other choice, because Cornell was my safety school and I could not get into Columbia. So like Frank Sinatra sings:

Start spreading the news
I am leaving today
I want to be a part of it
New York, New York

These vagabond shoes
They are longing to stray
Right through the very heart of it
New York, New York

I want to wake up in a city
That doesn't sleep
And find I'm king of the hill
Top of the heap
