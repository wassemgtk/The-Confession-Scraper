In response to confession #4637:
I don't know if you are who I think you are but your words have compelled me to write about us. I swear I think of you every day. I was in a deep, dark hole last semester and I found solace being with you. I want you to take a step. If you can't be romantic with me, I'd still love to be your friend. You're a great person and it hurts to have your words and your smile creep into my mind without even knowing if you feel the same. I want to say I hate seeing you but I can't. I don't care what you want to call our relationship, I still want you and you alone. We both messed up, I'm willing to start this over. I tell myself I've moved on but sometimes I can't help but feel dead inside. The melancholy we shared will never dissipate from my mind.
