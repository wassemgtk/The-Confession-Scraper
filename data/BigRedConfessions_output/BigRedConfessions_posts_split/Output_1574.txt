I kind of wish corporal punishment were instituted at Cornell if students act lewd on campus or disrespectful by texting or using their laptops in class and not paying attention in lecture. Where I am from in the South, my high school would paddle students who disrespected the faculty or received a bad grade on an exam, as an option over spending Saturday detention. Many students got a good wackin' from the teacher or principal, and quickly got the message they should not be disrespectful. Even in the 1950's, my parents remember how Cornell had the "in loco parentis" mission to make sure students grew up into respectful young men and women when they entered society and the workplace by making sure they would meet curfew and dress appropriately. I would also take a paddlin' if I got a bad grade on an exam from a professor and would learn quickly that I need to study more because it would hurt even more the next time.
