Not sure if it's the silent treatment or you are trying to let me know that what I did was somehow horrible. Regardless, I will not feel bad, cause it was totally harmless but you reacted as if I had killed your family (probably your time of the month). Either way, my patience is way too low for all this shit and I'm way too stubborn to breaks this silence. If things don't change soon, and I mean soon, I will simply phase you out of my life. It's really that simple.
