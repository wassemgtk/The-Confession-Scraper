I think I'm asexual; I don't desire to have sex with anyone, but I want to find my one person: the one I can share all my laughs and tears with, all my ups and downs. Someone I can travel the world with and know that he or she will always be there for me till the sun sets; someone to make sure every night is just as meaningful as everyday.
