Can the admin please be more selective about these posts. maybe consider the flow of secrets, not too many uber depressing ones all at once. It doesn't really reflect that well on our school, and its not fun to read. at all. 

[Admin Note - We post in the same order we get the posts. Sometimes they're not the most fun to read but the point of this page is for people to be able to say the things they haven't been able to, regardless of how it reflects on the university]
