"I met THE ONE last year, on the first day of school, and I knew for sure he was meant for me. I think he felt it too. We were in Cornell Store looking at laptops, and I saw him first, then he saw me and I felt him staring. From then on every time we made eye contact our eyes had a dialogue that could never be constituted with words. I could sense his presence whenever we were in the same space. He would sit near me in dining halls, and I would catch his glimpse as I walked to get food and sit down. I saw something in his stare. He was perfect for me. And then I found him on Facebook and added him and he accepted. Then I asked if he was willing to hang out, and he didn't answer. Then I heard from some friends that he went back home on medical leave, and he would be taking a semester off. And for some reason he unfriended me. I didn't understand why. It didn't make any sense. This year I never see him, but I think about him everyday, and I know he's back, but I just wish I'd get another glimpse of his beautiful face, just one more look into his eyes, to read what he is feeling. Some one tell me there's still hope??! What should I do to get closer, without doing any damage?
