I’m in a weird place right now.   I’ve been down quite a lot lately.  It’s weird because I’ll be in a really good mood, feeling like I have great friends and like I have a little bit of confidence in myself but then I’ll have one negative interaction and I can’t deal with it.  I get into this funk and I cry all the time and I feel depressed.  The thing is I know I have a lot going for me.  I know I’m a lucky person; I have a great family and people who love me but I just can’t help it sometimes, actually a lot of times.
