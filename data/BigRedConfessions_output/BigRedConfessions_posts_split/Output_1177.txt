You know what? As hard as this is for me, I am going to let you go. It started off with you chasing me, and now that you know I love you, I am the one chasing you. To you, I was probably some game, some doormat, some person to entertain you... I am so tired of you breaking my heart with your stupid mind games. You were the first person I loved. I still love you, but I know you don't love me anymore, because my personality is too annoying for you. I really do not regret spending time with you. You really made me happy. Now I have to let you go. I wish you an amazing future, and I hope all your dreams come true.
