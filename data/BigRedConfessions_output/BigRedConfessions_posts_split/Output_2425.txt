I don't know how to say this to you without sounding creepy but I really like you. Don't let me go. I feed off of your life force. You keep me going. I'll do anything to keep you smiling. We've only been dating for a little less than 6 months so this may be sudden and I really don't want to scare you away. I'm a guy who normally hides his feelings but you make it nearly impossible to do so. Thanks for everything. You're the best thing that has ever happened to me.
