I know that people think it's acceptable and maybe even expected to drink alcohol, despite being underage, but it makes me really uncomfortable. I was offered alcohol once by an adult when I was clearly underage, and I now hate being offered it. I keep refusing friends, but they think it's just one big joke, despite explicitly telling them that it makes me uncomfortable, so I've stopped talking to them. Some of them even got defensive (that makes me groan; if you're feeling defensive about this, then you probably did it at some point, just accept it and move on, don't justify it). So yeah, I know the whole "morality is subjective" crap gets pulled out as some profound argument that makes people put their chins into their hands and agree, especially with things like drinking, but maybe you should actually care about people's feelings instead of just acting based on a philosophy you think makes you sound thoughtful, or keeps you in a cushioned safe bubble where you don't have to worry about upsetting people. If you can't tailor an argument to a specific situation instead of using almost the same generic words every time, then you don't sound clever. People even think that my problem is funny, and it's not. I now don't ever want to try alcohol. I hope you're happy.
