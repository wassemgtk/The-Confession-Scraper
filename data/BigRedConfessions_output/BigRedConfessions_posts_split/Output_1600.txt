No one believes in me anymore. My mom has no confidence in my abilities. My father, who never even spent much time with me because he was always at work, says that he shouldn't have to pay the Cornell tuition because I'm "nothing special." I work so hard, I'm miserable, and I forgot why I came here in the first place.
