Sometimes all I think about is tea.... Oolong, earl grey, chamomile, chai, the list goes on. so many many options, so little little time. I've spent as much money on tea as on cornell tuition not to mention all of my brbs. theyre gone forever :( I need to cease this obsession... any advice, what do I do?
