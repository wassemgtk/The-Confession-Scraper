"To the group(s) of people who often sing near the Schwartz Center at 1:28AM: PLEASE STOP
I don't intend to sound rude or passive-aggressive,  but I live next door at Cascadilla, and your harmonies keep me and other Collegetown residents awake at night when we're trying to sleep. The music, admittedly is quite beautiful, but I think it would be better enjoyed by more people at a sensible hour. I know most of Collegetown is awake and partying well into the night, but the sound of voices singing is actually much louder and carries much farther than drunk college students. I support free expression, I support the arts, and I'd be sure to support the group(s) that conduct these outdoor concerts, but I don't think it's unreasonable to ask for people to be considerate of their neighbors. Thank you,
