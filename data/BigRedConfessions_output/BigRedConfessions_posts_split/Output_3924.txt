I've spent a couple of years up here, but I just realized how little personal information I know about a few of my better friends on campus. So I started asking them about their favorite movies, music, games, foods, stories... and I am surprised by how often I receive vague answers, as though they're insecure about it or think I have some hidden agenda. If you're one of those people, please stop that! There's no need to put up a wall like that. I'm not evaluating your tastes or secretly devising a plan to foil your love of cheesecake, I'm just trying to turn current friends into better ones and that's why I'd like to get to know you better! Even if I did judge you negatively for your love of quiche (ugh you disgust me) or thrash metal (I mean, not my thing, but I could live with that), then so what? I wouldn't be worth hanging out with, anyway! :)

And the sad thing is that this is starting to make me feel like I barely even know people here after spending half of my undergraduate years with them. I've started to realize that the people I go out with all the time won't ever be anything more than drinking buddies and hookups, and I more than likely won't keep in contact with them much after we graduate. I'm looking for so much more interaction than that in these last couple years, and I need someone who won't turn to stone whenever I try to get to know them. I guess that I'm just lonely... Screw that! I'll keep looking for someone that has the confidence to actually do a little give and take and tell me about themselves rather than get drunk, high, and hook up once in a while like so many others.

*Quiche-lovers need not apply. I already know too much about you.
