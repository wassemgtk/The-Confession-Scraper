I had a mental breakdown on Friday. I had a big fight with my closest friend the day before and I got pulled over on Tower road across from Uris Hall for riding through a red light - on my BIKE!! Can you believe the bullshittery and nitpickiness of the Cornell police? I can't. Anyway, the cop took my drivers licence and went back to write up a ticket for me. Thinking about my bad luck and fight with my friend, I started crying. Then, I forwent the crying and went straight to screaming. I think everyone on central heard me because a guest staying at the Statler hotel came out and asked what was going on and how everyone in the hotel could hear me. It got so loud that several vehicles on either side and several, several pedestrians stopped and stared. I never felt both so alone and so surrounded by people at the same time. The cop actually had to call for two backups. TWO. My voice still hasn't recovered. Two of my friends who were walking past stopped and helped me when they recognized the person screaming their head off was me. I love them so much for doing that. I know several 'friends' of mine who wouldn't give a shit and would continue walking, acting as if they didn't know me so it means a lot that they stopped and cared. Don't bottle up your emotions. Evaluate your friendships. It's always revealing to see who stays and loves you still after you completely break down.
