TFW you're taking a gap year, but all of your friends are either in medical school or receiving arm loads of acceptance letters. I was a bioengineering premed, but with my tanked GPA, I'm basically in the same boat as the partying premeds, and it looks like the Carribbean or DO program will be my best bet.
