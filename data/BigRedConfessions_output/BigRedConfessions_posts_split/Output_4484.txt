"When I'm with you, you make me feel so high
Nothing can bring me down, and I feel like I can fly.
Your smile, incredible, it shines incredibly bright,
When you flash your pearly teeth, it brights up the night.
Your eyes! I could look at them forever and continue to stare,
You're all that I need, you're essence would be my air.

You're incredibly gorgeous, in my eyes you're number one,
The best looking girl? That argument is closed and done.
You are gorgeous, but something even more beautiful took over my chest,
It was your personality, it really is quite the best.
When I'm having a bad day, when I'm mad or sad,
You'd turn me around, and you'd make me glad.
You'd make me laugh, have a good time, no matter how I felt,
Your personality is how you got my heart to melt.
Your laugh, so great, it's the best one for miles around,
When God created laughter, that's what he intended for it to sound.
You're so nice, too, no matter what you were never upset or mean,
All these great things are why I want to treat you as my queen.
Ask me ""Why do you love me?""; really, you should, you ought,
I'll reply with the honest answer: ""How could you not?"""
