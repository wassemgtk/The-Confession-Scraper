"So there's this girl I'm kinda crushing on. We were hanging out in kind of a small group last Thursday night, and we were flirting with each other pretty obviously for most of the night. Then Friday night came, and we had plans to go to the same party. I even texted her to make sure she'd be there, and indeed she showed up.

But then she kind of ended up in another group talking to people. Not wanting to seem too clingy, I moved onto the dance floor--the night was young, and I figured there'd be plenty of time to be with her. But before I knew it, this other girl was all over me. We started making out, and kept at it for a while. It was very visible, and this girl's best friend even made a comment to me about it (neither positive nor negative) the next day.

I also saw the girl the next day, and maybe it was just me, but she seemed to ignore me. She still talked to me, but I had to initiate the conversation, and she didn't seem as interested in carrying on a conversation with me as she had been on Thursday night.

If you're reading this, I'm pretty sure you know who you are. I honestly don't know if you were even upset by my actions--it could just be my own self-centered imagination playing tricks on me--but if you were I'm sorry. I mean, if I had been flirting with someone, then that person texted me to make sure I'd be at a party, I'd be upset if the person then proceeded to hook up with someone else all night.

Anyway, this is rambly and there's a good chance I'm misjudging some of her attitudes. Maybe she didn't even like me in the first place (although Thursday night involved some of the more blatant flirting I've ever been a part of). But since I won't get the chance to see her in person until after Thanksgiving break, I'm just writing to make sure she knows that I actually kinda like her (in my own passive-aggressive way), and that I'm not just going after any female life form that moves. Well, that and because I'm procrastinating this eight page paper I should be writing.

TL;DR-flirted with girl I like on Thursday night; hooked up with other girl on Friday night at a party she was at; hope I didn't fuck things up too bad"
