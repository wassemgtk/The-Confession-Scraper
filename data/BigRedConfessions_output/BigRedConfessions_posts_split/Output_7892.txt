I hate the double standard. I hate how guys are applauded for scoring girls and girls are slut shamed for expressing any sort of sexual desire. I want to be able to ask guys out on dates and flirt with people I'm interested in without fearing that I'm coming off as too forward, easy, slutty, or undesirable.
