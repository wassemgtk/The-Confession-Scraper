"Put on a good face. Don't let them see how sad you've been. Don't let them know what a failure you've been. Laugh off mistakes like shaking off water. They don't know you've been crying in your room. 
It's your problem. Face it yourself. 

Don't let him know that you really like him. Investment hurts too much. Repress it, conceal it. You're over it now. Too dangerous to give people your heart.  "
