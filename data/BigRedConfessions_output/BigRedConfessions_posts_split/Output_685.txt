I don't know why I want to end it so badly. I don't feel depressed, my GPA isn't great but it's not bad, and I have friends. Whenever I think about ways of doing it I never hesitate, I just continue the thought of me blowing my brains out or throwing myself in front of cars. I have felt this way since high school and has creeped up on me again recently. Somedays I honestly think that it wouldn't feel too bad to just not be here.
