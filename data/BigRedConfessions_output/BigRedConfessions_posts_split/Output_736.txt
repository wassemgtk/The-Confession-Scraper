Quite frankly, I think more products should be Made in the USA. Whenever you walk into the store you see low quality crap imported from elsewhere. There are so many countries that are taking away our jobs here in the USA and lot's of people come out of universities including from Cornell like I just did and can't find a job as a result. I would rather be a manufacturing worker and get good pay and benefits like a great life insurance policy, health care, and a pension plan than work at a fast food joint. Seriously, I had an great GPA (3.82 in Physics) from Cornell and the only job I could find was part time with no benefits at a pizza place. I feel like a worthless loser. :/  :(  It feels like sometimes I wasted my time going to Cornell to get a job that I could have after high school without wasting my parent's money. My parents never went to college and have been more successful than I have since they were able to buy a nice house and own a large business a few years out of high school and no they did not inherit shit from my grandparents. They earned it on their own during the 1980's, a time that was much better economically because of some great economic policies that allowed the middle class to expand and corporations to create more jobs. I think the American Dream is DEAD now, but I am hopeful that soon it will be back BIGGER and BETTER than ever before. I am a Christian and I pray and hope that God will help me find a job perhaps at the end of this year or maybe next year. I had to get this out, since I have been frustrated for the past few months.....
