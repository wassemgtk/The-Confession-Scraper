I have never had a boyfriend. I have never had my first kiss. I have never had sex. I am not a particularly attractive person either. My friends from high school always said I was cute and adorable, but it was in regards to the fact that I am small and childish looking. There have been guys that I liked in high school and we spent so much time together, but never had an "official relationship". I have met some guys that I am attracted to here at Cornell, but I feel like I have no chance. I am also isolated somewhat because I am a Freshman that knows nobody from back home. So many people know people from where they are from, but I have nobody. Also, I am not a person that likes partying, so there is the problem that I am socially awkward at the parties that I go to and I think that turns people off.
