So all 3 of my housemates are having their significant others stay at the apartment this weekend (of which 2 are visiting from outer cities). I am dreading both my imminent fate as the seventh wheel and the prospect of having to blast my music in order to drown out the sound of passionate love-making from every corner of this goddamn house while I lie awake at night, scared, traumatized, and terribly terribly alone. This will be a long weekend, indeed.
