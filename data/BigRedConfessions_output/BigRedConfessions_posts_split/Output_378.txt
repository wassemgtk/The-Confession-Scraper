Anyone who thinks toilet paper mounted in the "under" configuration is better than "over" has mental issues. How is it better? You're crazy. It's objectively worse. Also, if you don't ball the toilet paper when wiping, but fold it instead, you have issues too. A ball can follow the natural topography of your asshole. Just thinking about wiping with folded toilet paper makes me sick. And finally, apparently there are people who wipe while standing up. That's right, they stand up and wipe standing. Your gluteus contracts when you're standing, idiot. I don't even know how they do it, it has to be exponentially harder. These are things homo sapiens figured out 50,000 years ago and you're still doing them wrong. The world is doomed.
