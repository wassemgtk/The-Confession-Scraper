I haven't found a girl that I'm really attracted to in probably 6 months.  I'm not talking about physical attraction... there are still ladies in my life that turn my head right round.  But on the personality end of things, it's dealbreaker after dealbreaker.  Like "she's got the kind of fun personality I'm looking for... if only she weren't as immature as a sixth-grader".  Or "she's nice-looking and seems interested... but her weirdness level is off the charts!".  *sigh*  I'm sure the girl for me is out there.  I just haven't met you yet.  *breaks into Michael Buble chorus*
