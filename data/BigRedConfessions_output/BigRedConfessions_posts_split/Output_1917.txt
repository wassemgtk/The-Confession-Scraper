Imagine a typical night out at New York. You are wearing a button down shirt, slacks, nice shoes, your buddies by your side as you walk into this rooftop bar. Heck man, you’re pretty happy you even got in, considering that it is two guy friends you are with at the moment -testament to our looks, for sure. Tonight is the night, whatever that even means.
        First thing you do when you get there? Grab a beer, something ‘fancy’, you know, like a 12 dollar IPA. You’re working at BAML, 9:30 to midnight, so of course you can afford that stuff. Plus, you got to get something that nobody really knows about – demonstrate how “complicated”, “hipster” you are. Girls love that, or so you think.
        It is not like you really asked yourself if that is what they actually think. Majority of the nights, returning home from work where you make those PPT presentations, you swipe on your phone – left, right, right, ‘eh, she will work’ - right. It is like you’re in a relationship with the app and the pictures within it, not the people behind it. Radical? Well, that depends on how we define a relationship here. Do you keep in touch every day? Check. Do you spend at least 30 minutes together? Yepp. Do you miss not using ‘it’? Aha. 
        The point is you get laid. Slam, bam, thank you ma’am. No matter how many times that happens though, you always go back to swiping. So easy and convenient. Slept with three girls this week for less than 80 bucks – that’s a steal, am I right? You can make that back in like 3 hours after taxes, definitely worth it.
        It’s nothing but a convenience. The illusion of choice. Diversification, for the finance oriented. Why would you ever need something more serious? Agree with you there, 100%. Like any good banker though, we should answer a fundamental question – what are we diversifying here? What risk are we talking about? Whereas inherent volatility is (supposedly) well understood for stocks and commodities, what ‘volatility’ do we have in mind when swiping? Let’s take a stab at it, shall we? 
        The risk is getting hurt. Falling for someone so hard that you can’t stop thinking about them and go back to reading WSJ business section. Waking up in the morning and smiling because you think of her hair, hair lips, her complexion. You can’t be sure that they are into you as you are into them. After all, it’s not like there is anything official. 
        Look, the way I see it, there are two ways out of this situation. First, we devote ourselves to the other person, make our feelings known. Take them out on a date, (preferably before midnight) so you can get to know them (before they black out).  Doing this will open you up to volatility of the relationship and emotional rollercoasters, but the upswing can be huge. They can be that person that bring meaning to you, which make it all worth it.
        Option number two: pretend we don’t feel, pretend we don’t even have the need to feel. We watch Netflix & chill. We swipe right, send two emojis, get the number, hookup, repeat. Life is good, as long as we are in the game. But will you, the player, always be engaged in the game? Or will there be a time when you crash on a couch late at night, and think to yourself that something is missing?
        The beauty of option one is that we do end up getting hurt from time to time, but that pain is what makes us stronger. It’s how we learn more about ourselves, and what qualities are crucial in other people. We are honest with ourselves. We admit that we are afraid, yet work through it. Option two will spare us that, but at the cost of maturity. We will remain cowardly, we will remain scared of getting hurt. Like a child in a crib who never ventures outside of the little enclosure because the outside is full of sharp objects, heights, and dirt. 
        We were children once, but now we are adults. We took a step (well, more like a crawl) outside because curiosity overtook us. Take that step again. Get hurt. Learn. Devote and open yourself to people, and have people open themselves to you.
