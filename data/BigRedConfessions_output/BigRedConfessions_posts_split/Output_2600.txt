I came to Cornell for the fancy title that came along once graduating. Turns out I have screwed myself over. Since I have gotten here I work my ass off just to nearly pass, my grades are shit, I've made some mediocre friends and have no life outside of school.. All to say I graduated from Cornell. Turns out that this title won't mean anything since I can't keep up with the work, don't have any meaningful friendships here and have very minimal extracurricular activities to say I did. I'm so sick of trying so hard to feel so unaccomplished, it really messes with my head.
