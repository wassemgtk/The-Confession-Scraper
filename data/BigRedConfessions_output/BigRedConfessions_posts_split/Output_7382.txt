I feel so hurt when I hear about how your experiences related to (issue redacted) went so much better than mine, and how the worst things that ever happened to you would be a cake walk in my book. I don't blame, resent, or judge you at all and I'm glad it's been so much easier for you than it has been for me, but I don't think I can talk about this topic much anymore with you. It's psychologically triggering and still hurts me to know everything I have lost and am still missing in my life.
