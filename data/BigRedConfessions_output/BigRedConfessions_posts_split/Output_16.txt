FUCK EATING DISORDERS. It has literally impacted my year so much. I missed classes, hours and hours of studying, I missed homecoming, dragon day, missed out on making more than a few aloof friends. When I see a guy get pasta for dinner without a second thought without worrying how much oil is in the sauce or someone get a smoothie to be healthy while I watch them drink 400 calories of fructose, I wish that I was my ignorant young self again. I've done so much therapy, it's just all physical. I'm never full. Even after eating 10000 calories I am still not satisfied. Eating just makes me hungrier, every day is waiting for the next meal. Every day is tea, gum, coffee, running, anything to curb my hunger. Even at a near fatal bmi I was still scared of getting fat. People think that anorexics hate food. The truth is we LOVE food. We love it so much that we are scared of it. At my worst I was reading recipes in between sets at the gym and listening to food podcasts on the treadmill for hours. I honestly don't think it will ever go away but I hope one day it will no longer control me. It's so hard to get help from a friend for an eating disorder, especially as a dude like myself. If someone tries to help my ED tumor tells me that it's a scheme to make me fat, to ruin me, that I don't need help. Phew what a rant. Anywho...ya eating disorders are fucking awful, like 100x worse than you think.
