I always thought that people were more divided along class lines than anything else, but my experience here at Cornell has made me realize just how right I was. I rarely have any trouble relating to working and middle class students from other ethnic and religious backgrounds, but some of the wealthy students here seem like they grew up on a different planet with some of the things they think and say.
