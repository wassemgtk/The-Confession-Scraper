I am dreading to go home for Christmas because I am terrified of dealing with my stepfather. Part of the reason why I am a workaholic is so that I can get away from him one day through my success. I am really scared that I still can't get rid of him after I graduate college, because med school is another 4 years of zero income. I am contemplating whether I should give up my dream to become a doctor and find a more lucrative job...
