Remember this: He seems way more concerned about giving the appearance of feeling bad. He knew what he did was extremely shitty and he knew it made him look like a jackass. Some people just can't stand to be labeled as the bad guy. They look for a way to not be at fault, so they flip it around, and make try to themselves the victim. If it seems not genuine, there's a good reason for it...trust your gut because it's telling you the right thing
