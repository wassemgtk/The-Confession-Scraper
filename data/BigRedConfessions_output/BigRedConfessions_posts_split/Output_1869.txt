I'm struggling. I've never had this kind of problem before. No matter what I do, I can't get over this girl. I'm not even attracted to other girls anymore. I can't get her out of my head, and it's slowly driving me insane. I haven't been able to focus on school or practice at all, and the only time I don't feel this way is when I'm drunk. I thought it would start getting better over time, but it hasn't yet. I'm worried that I'm never going to be the same again. I hate the fact that I've let myself get to this point over a girl.  It seems so stupid to me, but I really can't help it. The saddest part is that we never even dated, I was just a summer fling to her. I just wish I could let her go and be me again.
