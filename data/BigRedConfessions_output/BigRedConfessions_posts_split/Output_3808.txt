I still remember that night. I met you at your place and you watched a scary movie with me even though you hate scary movies. I remember falling asleep and feeling your arm around me after you shut off the TV. I remember we kissed and being happy. I don't know what happened or why we stopped talking, but I miss my best friend and the person you were that night.
