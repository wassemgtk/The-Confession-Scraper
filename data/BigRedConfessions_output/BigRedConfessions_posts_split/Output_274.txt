I don't know what to do anymore. TAs, peers and professors say that an Ivy League school would make you automatically more competitive than other applicants, but that's almost never true in the real world. Taking more classes, getting involved in multiple leadership roles, having a passion toward your field of study doesn't even mean better internships when you see people in your major with almost no extracurricular involvement and professional experience getting into your dream company. Maybe it's best then to drop out of here and go to a community college instead, maybe that'll be more successful and make me seem more "compatible" anyway.
