Okay so most of this is mainly to vent about a friend being annoying as FUCK, but it's definitely applicable to life: 
1. If you complain and ask a friend to give you advice, then completely ignore the advice/refute everything they're saying in an attempt to help you and how it won't work, then DON'T come back in a few days and complain about the same shit. It's annoying and rude.
2. DONT LIE. Ever. To anyone. It's rude and makes you untrustworthy. I'm not talking little white lies or even exaggerating. I'm talking turning "they said they were busy and can't hang out" into "They said they hate me and I'm a loser :///" (Yes that actually happened. At that point, you're a liar)
3. Don't judge people before even knowing them. Don't think you know them and then call them losers are jerks. It just makes the world an angry place.
4. Don't complain about things but then take NO actions to fix it (similar to #1, I know. But still different). 
5. Don't form relationships out of desperation or in hopes to complete yourself. Usually, they cause codependency and unhealthy relationships/reliance on others. You need to be able to be happy with yourself before anyone else can be happy with you. 

Sorry. REALLY just needed to vent. Because after saying these things over and over and over, yet you still ignore them, I'm done trying to help you. At a certain point, only you can help you. You can't expect everyone else to change your life to make you happy. You need to make that change. You need to make a valid effort in changing the things in your life that you're unhappy about in order to make a difference.
