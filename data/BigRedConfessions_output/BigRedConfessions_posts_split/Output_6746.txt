I'm a (girl) senior in high school who recently got accepted to Cornell's College of Engineering for the Class of 2018. I know it's an incredible opportunity to be able to study at an Ivy League school and that I'm lucky to have been accepted, but I'm reading all these confessions and going on college confidential and college prowler and it seems like at Cornell I'd just be drowning in work, suffer from grade deflation and have a terrible GPA, and become depressed. Especially in engineering, I know the workload is already rigorous - but I'm scared I wouldn't be able to keep up with the work or wouldn't be smart enough to understand the material. I'm not a genius by any standard, and I'm already struggling with AP Physics C in high school. Is Cornell really worth it? Would I be able to enjoy my time there? How many of you actually feel oppressed and depressed by the workload?
