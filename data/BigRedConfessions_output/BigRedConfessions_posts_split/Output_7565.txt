Big/Little week was fairly disappointing for me. I have a twin, and I felt like while the girls around me were getting necklaces and spirit jerseys and insomnia cookies or CTB, I was getting sequins tossed on my bed sheet and a couple of ugly hand made signs and those cheap chalky valentines day hearts that no one eats.. To be honest, I would've rather not gotten anything at all, if it saved me the two hours I spent today (and have spent the past two days) cleaning sequins off my comforter and the ground.
