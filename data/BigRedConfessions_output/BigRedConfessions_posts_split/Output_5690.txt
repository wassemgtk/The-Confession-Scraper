The last 2 weeks I have been easily 10 times hornier than I've ever been in my life. Scratch that, 10 times hornier than all other times combined. I have no idea what's triggering this, some rogue hormone or something...? I don't know, but all of a sudden 95% of girls on campus look insanely gorgeous and I am eyefucking every one of them. I hope this period ends soon. It's crazy, I cannot focus on anything. There are so many of them. They are everywhere and they are so hot. It's like torture. It's gotten me to talk to a lot more of them, which is good, but I'd really like my brain to start regulating this a little, or I'm gonna lose my mind. Whomever said that Cornell didn't have pretty girls needs to get inside my head. Or really just needs to visit this campus. Because honestly, I have no idea how that rumor started, I've been to other campuses, and we have a heavily disproportionate amount of hot girls.
