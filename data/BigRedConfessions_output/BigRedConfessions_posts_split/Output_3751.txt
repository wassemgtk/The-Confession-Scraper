Sometimes I pretend my pen is a sword and my two hands are two people fighting each other. The fights that go on in my head are pretty cool and I act it out with my pens and their hands. In my head it's cool...but in real life it looks pretty lame. I was doing this in the library and this group of girls saw me and laughed at me. I've never felt so embarrassed in my whole life.
