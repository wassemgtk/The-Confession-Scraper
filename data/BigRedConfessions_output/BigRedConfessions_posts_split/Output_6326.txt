I'm sorry you found out that I liked you. I didn't know you had a boyfriend. I swear that if you had told me earlier, I wouldn't have forced myself upon you and made you uncomfortable. Right now things are really awkward between us and I still think you're a great person, so maybe we can still hang out as friends?
