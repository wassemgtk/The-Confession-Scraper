I love Cornell, but I really don't think college is a good choice for me anymore. My friend who didn't go to college and is instead doing modeling and acting gigs seems to be having the time of her life, and I'm extremely envious. I don't care to join either of those industries, but I just feel in my heart that I'm not cut out for college. Regardless of how hard I try, I can't seem to do well on exams. I can't bring myself to really care about the material I'm studying. Having a steady, consistent-paying job that I commute to doesn't appeal to me anymore. Honestly, I'm just so confused. I have no idea what I want in life anymore.
