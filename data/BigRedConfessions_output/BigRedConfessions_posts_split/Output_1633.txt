I want to talk to him. I want to chat with him, yet I'm afraid that he'll get annoyed. I'd think about him almost all the time when I'm not studying. 
I don't know if he feels the same way. I don't know if he is that nice to everyone as he is to me. 
The passed few days we didn't chat as much, and nor did we get to see each other.
I miss him.
This is my first time liking someone after middle school, and I never felt this way, I was never so troubled---partially because I was too young to fully understand if I was really having a crush on someone or was I just looking for that "love" everyone keeps on talking about.
Maybe I should confess, I don't know. I don't know what to do.
I keep telling myself to stop thinking about him, what he's doing, what he is thinking. Yet the more I think about stopping, the more I think of him.
These feelings are overwhelming me.
