I met you on a bus to NYC on Friday and we hit it off. You offered to give me advice with classes/life and I took you up on that, but I think I gave you the wrong number and I feel so bad! And I don't have enough info to find you on Facebook but if you comment or something I'll hit you up, I think you're chill af.
