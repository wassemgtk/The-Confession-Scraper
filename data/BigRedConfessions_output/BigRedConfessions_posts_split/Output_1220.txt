I like the quote "Great men are forged in fire. It is the privilege of lesser men to light the flame." I know it's a Doctor Who reference and this post will probably be cheesy, but even still, I think that it's an optimistic way to view the pressures of Cornell, the pressures of life. 
Maybe I'm one of the great men, hunkering down and growing stronger against the pressures of Cornell, of my life leading up to it, of my life after it. 
Maybe not. 
Maybe I'm one of the men lighting the flame, adding to the competitive pressures of Cornell and real life. 
Either way, I'm going to fight with all my strength. Either I'll be pushed to greatness or I'll push someone else. Either way, I'll be in the fight. And I won't give up easily.
