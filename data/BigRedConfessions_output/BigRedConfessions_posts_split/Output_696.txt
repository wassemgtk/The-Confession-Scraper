I'm a freshman & just finished my first semester. I was happy that I made it onto Dean's list but then I on the transcript I saw the median grades for my classes. For a few of them I actually made below the median (got a B and the median was an A- for example). And now I'm not so sure my start at Cornell was a good one... *sighs*.
