I'm a 20 year old female and I'm gay. I've always had thoughts about women in romantic and sexual ways but I always though these were just "girl crushes" or out of admiration. I've been with guys before and many of them were very sweet and wonderful men, but I never felt quite right being with them. I assumed it was because I was too immature to truly love another person. Now, I've come to the realization that I'm gay and I see myself ending up with another woman. I'm 99.9% sure my family and friends won't care but that doesn't change the fact that the thought of coming out absolutely terrifies me. I think about how this will change everything, nothing will ever be the same, and once I step out of that closet there's no going back in. I'm struggling between wanting to come out and not wanting my life and my relationships to change, but I also know that right now I'm not being true to myself. I'm stuck.
