I hated you about a month ago for complaining about problems I considered minimal, ignoring me, and (unknowingly) setting off my PTSD. Weirdly enough, the situations that made me so averse to you at the time ended up causing me to reflect on my life, seek help, and start truly recovering from problems that have plagued me for years. Now that this is done, maybe we can start over if you're a better person than I thought you were and you have no negative feelings toward me. Regardless of what ends up happening, you were unwittingly a catalyst for my recovery and the reason I'm becoming myself again. I'm going to have a much more normal, healthy, productive future than I ever envisioned previously.
