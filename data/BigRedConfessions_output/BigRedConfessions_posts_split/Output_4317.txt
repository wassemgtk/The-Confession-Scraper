I know you are going through a bad breakup, but I really like you and your bengladeshi accent turns me on every time. I can’t tell if you flirt with me or not, but when you called me beautiful the other day (even though you were smiling when you said it) , it really made my day. So, stop talking about your ex with my best friend and instead talk about me! There’s a reason why she is your EX. I will treat you better than that bitch and she definitely did not deserve your love. You know who I am, so make your move already, I am waiting!
