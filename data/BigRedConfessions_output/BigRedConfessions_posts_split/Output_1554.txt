When I was in high school down South, we used to hold daily prayer sessions right before school started by the school flagpole. I miss those dearly. I wish I could amalgamate a group of conservative believing students to do that by Baker flagpole every morning before we make our trek up the hill and begin our classes, to pray for each others well being and that of our campus community who may not be spiritual so that they may too hear the word of God one day in their lives and be blessed by his presence.
