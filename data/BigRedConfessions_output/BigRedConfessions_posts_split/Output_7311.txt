"To [redacted]: I don't want to come off as a creep; I am just a distant admirer who means no malice. I saw you running in Barton last week while I was doing a workout of my own. How could I not stop and stare? Your majestic form, powerful stride... The strained, yet fiercely determined look on your face as you ran lap after lap...

I do not mean to objectify you and sincerely apologize if that is how this post is coming across. There is something incredibly alluring about seeing a strong, attractive female, fighting through pain and succeeding again and again with each lap. Know that my attraction to you is secondary to the respect and admiration I have for you.

I only wish I had the courage to say this to you in person.
