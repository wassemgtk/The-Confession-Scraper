I finished finals a few days ago. If I wanted, I could have taken the next bus back home. But I keep coming to the same area of the library in the hopes of seeing you. Every morning for the past few days I would pray that you would come and study just one more day in the hopes of seeing your beautiful face just one more day. Thank You for making these past few days bearable.
