I'm sure you heard me sobbing through the wall.  I just wonder if somewhere something inside of you cared even the smallest bit.  This had to happen.  I just had to come to terms with the fact that I would never have been even your third or fourth priority.  That night was the breaking point and I do apologize for the things I said even if it seems they didn't affect you in the slightest.  I will miss you though, my bed seems so empty now.
