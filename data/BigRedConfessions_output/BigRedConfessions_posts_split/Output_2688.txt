I have a micropenis. I am completely terrified that I will never be able to find love, since sex is obviously very important in a relationship. I can usually a couple of days in a row without thinking about my size but the moment I do I get really anxious and horrified. I have had the opportunity to have sex but I am too scared to show a girl my penis. I know this seems like a minor issue but I am absolutely horrified that I will never be able to be in a relationship because of my penis size. This thing has affected my confidence so much. The worst thing is I know I can't do anything about it. It is not something I can help...i'm just stuck with it. I'm just assuming that I will be alone and a virgin for the rest of my life. I am nearly 20 years old and I have never had anything remotely close to a girlfriend. I'm not sure how much longer I can live with this. I know it seems ridiculous to worry so much about this but I am extremely concerned. Sorry for the rant...I can't really tell anyone about this and I just had to get it off my chest.
