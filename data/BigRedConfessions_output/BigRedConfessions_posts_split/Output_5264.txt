"Goodbye is the saddest word. But even though we promised it wasn't really goodbye, I cried. I cried and I cried and I cried because I know that all that's left of the little, beautiful, spark we had is ashes. A spark that you ignited, after all. Then she came back into your life. Even though you didn't tell me anything I know you were headed straight for her right after we shared our last words for now. I don't know what hurts more, not having you here anymore, or the fact that your heart always belonged to her, even when you were right here holding me. I know you didn't want to hurt me so you didn't tell me to my face. I could tell you were extremely anxious to be free toward the very end. Not sure if I would've preferred you telling me or just continuing on all this uncertainty that I'm living with now.
It literally feels like someone is trying to stab at my heart and keeps knocking the wind right out of me. I'm putting up a fight but keep getting weaker with every blow. 

Wondering if my heart will ache forever for you and what could've been....
I feel so run down and helpless now. Thanks. 
Oh yeah and by the way, I STILL LOVE YOU. 

Think of this when you're telling her you've been nothing but distraught about getting back to her, because you sure weren't complaining when I was taking her place.
