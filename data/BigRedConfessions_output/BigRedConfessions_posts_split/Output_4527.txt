After arriving at cornell I feel 0% confidence whenever I talk to girls. I feel just so unattractive to everyone. I really don't want much I just want to find someone who I can just be with who makes me happy and whom I'd be proud to be with. I hate feeling like this but I just can't help it. I know it sounds pathetic but what is a guy supposed to do?
