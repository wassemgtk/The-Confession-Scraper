I hate my apartment mate. She is so inconsiderate and I feel like she uses me like a dishrag. I am always there for her if she needs tutoring, comfort or whatever. But she never asks me about my day, or how I feel. I always invite her to hang out with me and other friends, but I know she won't invite me to hang out with other people. She loves being the center of attention.
