As much as I like being independent and happy in myself and I know I don't need anyone, it would still be nice for someone to want me. I just want to find a kind and selfless person to share my happiness and joy of simple things with, but also my sense of adventure and amazement at what the world holds. I don't know if I'll find that person at Cornell or not, but it would be nice if this fall, I did. It just seems that everyone I end up liking is never as kind as I think they are. I just want someone who is genuinely kind.
