Falling in love is no doubt an absolutely beautiful feeling. But i guess everything has two different sides. While I do embrace the love I feel for my boyfriend, and I do feel I am a lucky girl for having him in my life,  it also scares me. Being in love makes me feel so vulnerable.. so susceptible of being hurt and broken down. I used to be so strong on my own but now I feel like if something happened between us, my world would come crashing down, and that idea does worry me. The future is just so unclear and I'm scared about what might come.
