I'm a guy and I was forced into having oral sex with my 16 year old male cousin when I was about 3 or 4 years old. My memory of it is pretty hazy, but all I remember is that he enticed me with one of my toys and that he never "finished the job" because he heard my grandmother coming into the room. It's been nearly 18 years since that incident and for most of my life I've just suppressed that memory. I just don't know how to react to it or if I've even really been affected by it. I'm not sad nor do I feel like I'm an innocent victim. I do know that I am sexually bisexual, but romantically hetero..if that makes sense lol. But I've never even kissed anyone of either gender and when I notice a girl likes me I usually break out into cold sweats and have to leave the room. I don't think I'm unattractive and there have been a few girls in the past who've had some interest in me. But I find it difficult to connect to people emotionally. I feel emotionally hollow and don't think it would be fair to enter a one-sided relationship. I take comfort in being a loner.  On the whole, I have a pretty negative attitude towards sex (which I view as a shameful act) and humanity in general. The problem is, I don't know if this is a result of that early encounter, or because of my abusive upbringing under fundamentalist, but hypocritical "Christian" parents, or if it's just me. Is it possible to have been sexually abused as a child in the past and not have had any consequences because of it? After all, as far as I can remember, it was a one-time incident.
