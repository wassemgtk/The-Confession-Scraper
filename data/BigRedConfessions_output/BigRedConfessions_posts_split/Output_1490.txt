I'm so lonely at Cornell. 
Yes I have friends, and I'm even on an academic team. It's just that most of my friends find my too clingy... whenever I make new friends, I want to spend all my time with them, do everything with them. And I think that annoys people. 
The friends I do have never want to do anything with me. No matter what I suggest and when I suggest it, they turn me down. They insult me a lot, saying its just jokes, but it actually hurts. I've started spending more and more time alone, because I'm sick of being insulted and rejected all the time. I seriously just wish I had a friend who would just tell me "leave me alone for a few hours, I gotta study," whenever I'm talking to them/asking them stuff but they don't have time, rather than the friends I have now, who instead of saying that, hold it all in, and just start hating me and finding me annoying. 
I seriously wish i had SOMEONE to talk to... I'm the type of person who hates being alone. i hate it. i cant tolerate it. dont get me wrong, Im not depressed or anything, I'm actually really happy... just lonely. 
I can't really explain it. Except that the friends I do have aren't REAL friends... and I'm really just looking for a friend wholl just listen to me, understand me. Tell me to leave them alone for a bit instead of bottling up their feelings against me because I keep talking to them (because they havent told me not to).
