I love to listen to Michael Savage, the conservative talk show host running the Savage Nation, because he tells you like it is dammit rather than sugar coating the truth and even gets Donald Trump on the show. Yay! If only people who go to school with me knew, I would be ostracized because I love conservative talk shows that bash idiots and ignoramuses.
