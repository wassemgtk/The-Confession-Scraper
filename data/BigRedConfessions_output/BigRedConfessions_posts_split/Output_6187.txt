Dear Roommate: Can you please stop masturbating? I know you think I am asleep, but I am not. I know what you are doing and it is disturbing. I wish I can tell you to fucking stop, but we never talk and you are very quiet and weird. I am very surprised that you do what you do every night because you are super religious and a goody-two shoes. But anyways please STOP. I can't sleep at night knowing that you are doing what you are doing...
