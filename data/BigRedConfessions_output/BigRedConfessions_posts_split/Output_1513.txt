There was this girl, a missed opportunity, a pearl in the sea, the one who got away, if you will. 
We met on Tinder, and perhaps it was destined to fail from the beginning. But let me tell you the story anyways. We watched movies together (it just happened to be netflix), cooked together, and even studied together. What made me gotten close to her the most, was that she invited me over for a thanksgiving party she hosted so I can get to know all her friends. It felt magical, although perhaps it was something she put in her butternut squash soup. Over the course of thanksgiving break, however, the tone changed. Maybe she met someone else, or she was going through something, and I would do anything to help if she'd let me. 
I invited her to my formal knowing that it would probably be the last time she would say yes to me for anything. I enjoyed every moment we had together, and Italian food just so happened to be her favorite. But something did change, and we ended things shortly after. 
Thinking back, I realize she's the most beautiful and sweetest girl in the world, to me. She wanted to do well on the MCATs so she can be a pediatrician, and I'd do anything to go back in time to help her study. I'm working hard in a related field as well, and if fate permits, maybe we'll cross paths again someday, and she can give me a second chance.
