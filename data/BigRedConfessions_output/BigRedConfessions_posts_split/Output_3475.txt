Last night, I cried...I cried with so much anger and hurt that I think even my roommate knew I was crying in my bed pretending to be sleeping. Well, the reason I cried is that my best friend, or who I thought was my best friend, did nothing to make me feel special on my birthday. She did not get me a card, she did not bake me a cake, she did not get me balloons, she did not get me a present, she did not even arrange the dinner, and she did not even make those stupid silly posts on FB. I waited patiently all day...thinking she was holding out on a huge surprise. But noooo there was nothing. On the opposite, she closed the door on me and ignored me like I wasn't there talking to her. I don't know what I should do. I feel taken for granted and not appreciated at all. She doesn't make the effort to be my best friend yet she uses those words every chance she gets. I just wish she actually did things a best friend would do.
