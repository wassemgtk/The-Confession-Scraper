"Anyone who favors assault rifle/shotgun bans over pistol bans is racist. Plain and simple. According to the FBI, 510 gun deaths in the year 2014 were caused by rifles and shotguns; 5562 deaths were caused by handguns in that same year. In other words, you are more than 10 times as likely to be killed by a pistol than to be murdered by weapons dubbed as “mass killing machines.” Now let’s break-down who exactly is murdered by each weapon type. 

Black poor people are the most common group to be killed by handguns. Here’s why: There is a strong positive correlation between poverty and gun violence. Moreover, black people, of any racial group, have the greatest chance of being poor and living in inner city areas prone to crime. Statistics back this up: black people comprise half of gun deaths. Finally, what weapon to poor people, often black, use? A pistol, because that’s the easiest and cheapest weapon to obtain; acquiring an assault rifle is a significantly more arduous process. 

Now for people killed by assault rifles and shotguns: these are usually in mass shootings in which white people living in affluent areas are killed. Take, for example, the Sandy Hook shootings, in which scores of white children were murdered. Really, for most mass shootings, the perpetrator, who will go to whatever lengths to obtain an assault rifle, unleashes absolute hell on as many people, most commonly in suburban areas (where the victims are usually white). 

Let’s compare the two categories: the first category consists of more people being killed by handguns who happen to be mostly black and poor. The second category consists of far fewer people being killed by assault rifles and shotguns who are mostly wealthier and happen to be white. Therefore, demands that assault rifles be banned implicate the message that the lives of 5 black people killed in inner city violence are worth less than the lives of 5 white people killed at an Oregon college. This is the true meaning of hypocrisy on the Left for touting that “Black Lives Matter” while favoring gun reform that safeguards white lives more so than black lives. 

If the Left’s actual agenda was to reduce gun violence, they would advocate for either limiting the amount of guns (all types) in the U.S. and/or restoring law and order to impoverished areas. If you eliminate all guns, you can presumably, as the Left likes to believe, significantly reduce gun violence. And if you improve the poverty situation plaguing our cities, there will be fewer firearm homicides in those areas. But to favor assault rifle/shotgun bans over handgun bans is bigoted and does little to help America’s supposed “gun epidemic.”"
