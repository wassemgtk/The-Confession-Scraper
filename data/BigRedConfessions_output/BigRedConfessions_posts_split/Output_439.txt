I feel so incompetent. I see people around me taking 20+ credits, in Greek life, in a professional fraternity, in a project team, in three other clubs, doing publishable research, with a job, with internships for the summers, etc. I am not even doing half of those things, and I am already struggling. I feel like I am never good enough here, academically and socially. I really want to do/join some of these things, especially a project team or a professional frat, but it's sad to know that I will not make it in, so why bother applying and embarrassing myself. I know I shouldn't compare myself to others, but I can't help it. I am nothing, and I feel like I won't even make a contribution to this world.
