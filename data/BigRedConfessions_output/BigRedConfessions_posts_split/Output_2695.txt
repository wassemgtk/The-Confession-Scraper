I just learned that when a naked mole rat gets pregnant, instead of her womb extending outward, her spine elongates so that she won't get stuck in the tunnels. This is absolutely hysterical. Imagine a pregnant naked mole rat getting stuck in a tunnel. Imagine a pregnant woman getting stuck in a tunnel. I can't stop laughing and I don't know why...

On a separate note, TRUE FACTS ABOUT THE OWL.... spot on. Everyone should watch it at least once in their life time. 

God I love nature.
