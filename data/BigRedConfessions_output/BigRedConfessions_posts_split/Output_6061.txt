I have been sexually assaulted 3 times in my life. Two of those by males, once when I was 8 and once at 13. But last year, a girl did it to me. I was drunk and she did not believe that I could be gay. I repeatedly told her i did not want to do anything and she did, she did lots of things that I did not want, including taking my clothes off, making me touch her and having her touch me, she pushed me down on her bed and made me drink more, telling me that "it would feel great and i secretly wanted it" . I tried telling people about that last event and they said that it was not possible, that a guy could not be molested by a girl. It makes me feel stupid, it makes me feel worthless. I did not want it.
