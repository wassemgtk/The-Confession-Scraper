After attending a discussion series tonight, I've come to the sad realization that in considering child care options for when I do have my children, after my maternity leave from work I could never let my mother care for my children the way my grandmother did for me. My mother has some major emotional/psych issues that she doesn't recognize and won't seek help for. Simultaneously I don't know how I feel about having a nanny or a stranger care for my baby. It all seems so complicated now. My whole future seems so depressing regarding this. Who knows if I'll even be able to have kids because of this. Hopefully my future husband's mom/family is kind and sane. If not I have no clue what's gonna happen or if my children will have the privilege of enjoying their grandparents. :(
