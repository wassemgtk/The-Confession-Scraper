I am the OP from #3832.  All right.  I get it now.  Want to know what made me realize I was wrong?  It was your comment, [redacted].  But I’d like to argue that I am not an abysmally stupid fuck, but rather an abysmally uninformed fuck.  Based on the information I had, Cornell doesn’t even have to let the accused rapist know who accused them.  As far as I can tell, that’s actually true, which is fine with me (rapists should be treated like the dogs they are; I personally give zero shits about whether they get due process).  But I hadn’t read Section 6.4 until now, and I’m appalled.  Although many levels of punishment are written into the code, the final decision about which one is applied to the rapist is TOTALLY in the hands of the administration.  There’s no concrete “rape=prison” written into the code.  In fact it’s more like “rape=whatever punishment the administration is in the mood for on a given day”.  Now THAT is wrong.  I apologize for my earlier post, and I want you to know that I’m going to talk to Skorton about this.  And if change doesn't happen this year, our new female president might be more receptive when she takes over.  You keep spray-painting mattresses, and I’ll do my best on my end.
