To the guy I keep seeing everywhere!! I swear I'm not stalking you, for some reason our schedules match, I really don't mean to invade your space ( I'm sure you definitely don't mean to invade mine)...just letting you know I don't hide in Olin/Starbucks/ corners just to see you. Its actually starting to get annoying cuz youre cute and I can't have you.
