I lost my grandpa almost one year ago. We've been talking over phone calls since I came to college. Because of his bizarre life path, he knew a lot of things, from rocket science to composite materials. My grandpa was always my source of inspiration, and I'm proud to be his pride. After he passed away, I couldn't count how many times I dreamed of him and found myself waking up in tears. Sometimes I felt guilty because I screwed my school work up, and I was afraid that he'd be disappointed at me. My relationship with my parents is not particularly well; we get along well, but I just don't find that much confidence and inspiration my grandpa gave me. I feel so lost now; I really wish I can drag myself out of that mentality, but I just can't.
