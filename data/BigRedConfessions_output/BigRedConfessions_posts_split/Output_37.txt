I am disappointed in myself. I wasn't very careful or thoughtful on what classes to take first semester, and ended up taking two classes that I didn't like very much, were too difficult for me, and aren't even that relevant to what I want to major in now anyway. I didn't have to take them. I'm a freshman by the way. I don't feel like explaining why I chose those two classes, but I had good reasons at the time. Because I got low grades in these two classes, my first semester gpa wasn't good. Oh well, at least grades from other classes will offset these scores. I learned a lot from this experience, which I am grateful for. But I can't ignore the fact that those two grades will always be on my record. And I'm still mad at myself. This makes me sad.
