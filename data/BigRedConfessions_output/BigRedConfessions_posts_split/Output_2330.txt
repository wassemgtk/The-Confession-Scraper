I've been at Cornell for 5 semesters practically, and I've never looked forward to doing any of my assignments that I would somehow bomb. I've been in and out of depression feeling weak because no matter what I do, I just fuck up. I can't afford to transfer to another school because I'm too poor and can't handle being in debt.

However... For the first time, I felt excited about a project in one of my math classes and all I do now is talk and think about it. This could be a turning point for me here at Cornell. 

Moral of the story: if you're struggling to find yourself here at Cornell, it takes time. You just gotta keep moving forward no matter how weak you feel. Things will unravel by themselves. Stay strong Cornell, stay strong.
