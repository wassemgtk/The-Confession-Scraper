It's really frustrating as a waitress in Collegetown when students dine in and don't leave a tip. I understand that in some countries tip is already included in the bill or there's no such thing as a tip to begin with. But sometimes I feel like some students that dine in deliberately don't leave a tip, especially international students (from China)... It's frustrating when after nearly an hour of service they walk right out. Waitresses don't earn that high of an hourly and we depend on those tips. We're students before waitresses and tips really do make all the difference. If you think the service is not up to par, still leave a tip and let me or my manager know. We would much prefer that. Or just don't dine out. Tipping is just proper etiquette in the U.S. and if you don't, it just reflects poorly on you as the customer.
