I've been suffering from very low libido for a little more than a year now (probably stress-related), and got out of a long-term, long-distance relationship last semester. Since the break-up, I'd hardly thought about sex and hadn't masturbated at all. But because today is Valentine's, I consciously decided that I'd treat myself to some masturbation time.

I feel like my libido has been unlocked! How am I going to make it to graduation without real sex? I've never considered casual sex before, but I'm thinking about it now.
