"I hate how a significant portion of both genders “rate” prospective partners (irrespective of orientation) with a number-based system based almost completely on looks. I’m a dude and although I do admit physical attraction is an important initial factor and that I do I guess decide to date women by how well they measure up to my ideal attributes, I try my best to not be superficial. In my mind, if a girl is not drop-dead gorgeous but is attractive enough to me and is particularly interesting, I will definitely consider asking her out. I know, I know a lot of people are just looking for some NSA action. But for building a relationship—many of you guys and girls are missing out on some interesting people by holding them to ridiculous physical standards.
Just my two cents."
