so I'm in my sophomore year and I'm realizing how much I really hate this school. I am so much happier when I'm away or at home during breaks. I am dreading returning next week. I have a few friends but none I feel very close or attached to. I am doing well academically but feel like I'm failing socially despite having lots of friends outside of Cornell. If I have the grades for it, should I just transfer out after this semester before it's too late? I don't like Ithaca, the large class sizes, or the social and Greek scene here and think I might be happier elsewhere...
