When I was 17 I had a pregnancy scare and nearly scared my parents (both stereotypical Asian doctors) to killing me and themselves in shame. Luckily, I wasn't. But as a punishment my mom made me rewrite an entire Organic Chemistry textbook over a series of weekends and vacations. I'm a junior now and believe it or not, it's really helped me out a ton. Thanks Mom. O and I've kept my virginity since I was 17.
