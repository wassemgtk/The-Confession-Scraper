Too often, brilliant students come to this brilliant campus and forget who they are in the midst of comparing themselves to others, and by allowing perceived failure to bring them down. Well , technically, I wouldn't say allow, because it's quite difficult not to when you have high expectations for yourself and lofty goals coming here. But you know what's worse of a "failure" then your first bad prelim grade or multiple rejections? Allowing it to consume you, redefine you, and take control of your life. That's ultimate failure- when instead of fighting, challenges are able to destroy you; to the point where you become no more- where you stop being passionate about the causes you once were before arriving to this campus, and let the sucesses of others being you down. Well, I have something to say to this as I once experienced all of this during my first semester here. Instead of working so hard only to get half hearted results, study differently! Yeah , first test scored might be bad but that's ok because It was the first one! It's ok not to be perfect because success doesn't come immediately, it takes time. And yes, success does take admitting that you may be a below average student right now, but you won't stay there. You will improve your ways, and fight on. Instead of working harder, work smarter. Instead of studying alone, study with a group. Didn't get the internship? Call and ask why. Success at a higher level( college and behind) takes developing yourself, and improving yourself. That's why college is supposed to make you grow. You are here because you are hard working and intelligent and capable, be you, and stay you, one of the top universities in the world picked YOU! You have what it takes to succeed, think about what those qualities are; just remain faithful to yourself and don't give up.
