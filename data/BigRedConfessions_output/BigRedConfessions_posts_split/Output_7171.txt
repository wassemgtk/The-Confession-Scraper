Why does it take me saying that I'm depressed or suicidal for my so called friends to start showing that they actually care about me and start treating me like an actual human being that they want to talk to? Honestly, you say that I'm one of your closest friends but how is it that I have never felt like I was before? Your words mean nothing to me when your actions say otherwise. I don't want any of your pity reassurance and sympathy, especially when you're going to go back to treating me like how you did before you knew. If I felt like they actually cared I wouldn't feel like I do now. In the future, I'm not going to bother telling anyone until it's too late.
