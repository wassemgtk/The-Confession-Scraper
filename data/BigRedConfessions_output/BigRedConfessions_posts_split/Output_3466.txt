I don't generally believe in love at first sight but it happened to me when I first saw you last Fall. By work of the holy spirit, we ended up together in the same teams in all three classes we were taking together and you were there always supporting me as a new student. I don't know if I will ever tell you my feelings towards you, but at this point you should probably know as I stare at you A LOT during class and always approach you anywhere I see you. I am pretty sure I am not attractive for you, but I hope I could tell you how much I love you girl so I can be happy with myself.
