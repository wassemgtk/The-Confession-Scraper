"I had a nervous breakdown recently. It felt out of control, like the world was ending. It was fucking terrifying.

It made me not able to finish a project with someone, leaving them to finish it themselves. I needed to calm myself because I value my well-being more than a project grade. I apologized profusely but they're still being passive aggressive and completely unsympathetic.

Like, how the fuck am I supposed to tell them I wanted to kill myself that day?"
