Based on my limited dating experience so far -- about 12 dates -- I've concluded it's better not to kiss the girl at the end, even if you had a really good time and you got a good vibe from her. If you do, you would generally get a positive reaction and she may even text you first later, but then it's less likely she'll want to see you again after she's had some time to think about it. The dates where I didn't go for it, even if I thought it was appropriate, were all followed by second dates and things generally developed better. I think it may just be a bit too forward or flingy to kiss at the end of the first date, which sends an ambiguous message. That's just my experience -- of course I'm sure there are instances where people kissed and it was great after, but I think the probability is lower she will be interested in seeing you again.
