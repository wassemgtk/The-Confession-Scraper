My mom says that she doesn't care what I get for grades here since "it's Cornell" (given that I'm trying my best), which should feel liberating. Weirdly, it's not. Because if I don't get perfect grades, then it seems as though my excuse for being a typically shy human being is void. It's more of a struggle for her to get me to do social things, and she actually gets extremely disappointed when I'd rather curl up with a book and study instead of going out with friends. Sometimes it just feels a little backwards.
