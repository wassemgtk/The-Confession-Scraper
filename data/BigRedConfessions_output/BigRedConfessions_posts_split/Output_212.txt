I feel you, because I am a Cornell alumnus who also works at a government agency dealing with the public. I have come to the conclusion that a large majority of people are mentally ill in this country. Many people are like drones. They do not have a purpose in life unfortunately rather than to get up, get dressed, and go to school or work, have sex, and repeat. I'm sorry I'm cynical, but it's true. That or they are ingesting large amounts of mercury, lead, and cadmium in their diets or lifestyles, because they exhibit the symptoms of heavy metal poisoning. A lot of larger cities have old piping and the water often contains heavy metals such as lead. Also, marijuana is often grown in volcanic soils which have a lot of mercury and many young people smoke it. Cadmium is present in cigarettes too. Working in a government run drug recovery facility, I can attest to the fact that the facility is nothing more than a waste of tax payer funds. I feel bad, but it provides me for a good paying job. Drug addicts will never recover and all their misery provides for me is job security.
