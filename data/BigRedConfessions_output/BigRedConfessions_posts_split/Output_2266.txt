I'm beautiful. but a horrible person. I've cheated on or fucked over every guy that's really cared about me. I had a fucked up and abusive childhood, and parents who have made me feel like nothing. For some reason I care about you and it scares the shit out of me. I want to hook up with you, but I'm scared of feeling anything again.
