I'm a freshman. I'm a super awkward person and new people intimidate me especially at parties so i haven't made many friends here so far. I've never kissed a girl or even been in a relationship so I keep telling myself that one will come my way, but my anxiety and self consciousness prevents me from talking to anyone. I'm terrified I'm going to end up super depressed in the next four years and I don't want that to happen."

My boyfriend likes to role play as birds when we have sex. He puts silicone eggs inside me, feeds me snacks and builds a nest for us to cuddle in. It's the most utterly romantic thing a man has ever done for me."

I wanted to date you. I'm pissed on how easily you moved on just because I didn't want to have sex with you (hopefully, at least just yet)."

""Having a 4+ GPA is supposed to feel good. Graduating is supposed to feel good. Getting a good, well-paying job is supposed to feel good. None of it feels good. At every turn in my life, I feel like I'm either doing what I'm supposed to, or what I think is best for """"future me."""" And I'm pretty good at it. I applied myself in high school because my parents wanted me to. I got into Cornell, and I came here because it was the best school I got into, and future me needed an education. I worked my ass off and graduated and got a good job, because that's what people are supposed to do. In the past couple of years, it's all come crushing in on me. I only can have fleeting moments of happiness, the rest of the time I feel empty at best or nervous and depressed at worst. I don't think anyone else realizes it because I usually seem like a cheery person, but between cheeky comments and dumb jokes I'm dying on the inside.

Everyone around me seems to have love, passion, or both, and I've never experienced either. I hoped that when I came here, I'd find something to be passionate about, but I've only felt alienated by people who have felt it since they were in diapers. Nothing I do ever """"speaks"""" to me the way people say passion should. Whenever I get close to someone I panic and push them away. I can't open up to anyone. If I could, I'd be telling them all this, and not a Facebook page.

Sure, I have friends, and I like them, but now that they're mostly moved out and away, I just don't really feel much for them. Everyone was getting emotional, crying, demanding hugs, and I just smiled and said we'd meet again. I didn't care, but they did.

I do everything I'm supposed to do, and soon there won't be anyone telling me I'm supposed to do anything anymore. And it's terrifying. I don't have passion, and I don't have motivation. I don't know what I'll be living for, even though I've done everything right, as far as I can tell.

I don't know the last time I felt the way I'm supposed to feel, but it's all I really want."""

I hate guys. While I know that not all of them suck, the ones I've been involved with suck even though they're all different. I thought the last one liked me too. Even though we were just regularly hooking up for a few months, he would show his affection through small, cute acts and that gave me faith. However, his not-giving-a-fuck-about-me became very evident when we parted ways without even a hug. He doesn't even respond to my texts. I feel so sad and so worthless that I can't even leave a lasting impression on someone I've spent so much time with this semester. I know I deserve better. I deserve to be happy. I wish I found someone who wouldn't treat me like shit for once."

7,2016-08-27 15:04:22,"8142

I really do not want to be alive. I don't want to be dead. But I also don't want to be alive. I want to have never existed. Nobody wants me and nobody cares that I exist. I've been rejected by everyone. In romantic, friendship, or professional contexts, people's reaction to me has essnentially been - """"ew"""". Women think """"weirdo, creep"""" and try to stay as far away as possible. Every new group of people I've met have all become friends and immediately ostracized me. If I try to forcefully insert my presence into a social situation, no one talks to me, they just continue talking to each other and then slowly drift away from me. I've never been past a first round of interviews. I've seen in the eyes of everyone who's ever interviewed me, within 5 minutes of talking to me, that they could not wait to get me out of their office and never respond to an email from me again. My mom barely has an interest in talking to me.

I cannot contribute to the world. No one serious will ever hire me. I could do very low-skill labor, that's about it. My Cornell education will count for nothing. If an interview was part of the admission process, I would have never gotten into Cornell. No one will have my children. And that is a good thing, as if I pass these miserable genes on, my kids will most likely feel the same challenges and be stuck on this planet with no future. So what is the point of my existence... It's been non-stop suffering and loneliness since I became self-aware. I don't want to be alive. But I don't have the guts to kill myself. So the suffering will continue until I die of sadness."

I sent an email to myself with some job application materials, to finish later and send to a prospective employer. I typed ""Good luck!"" in the body of the email. And when I saw it later in the day, I went ""Aww... so sweet"". I have issues."

Hey, you're a good person. I'm sorry we drifted apart, I fully take the blame, but it was best for us both. You had an opportunity to get at me when I was more vulnerable, and yet you didn't. We don't have to be friends, but I've still got your back."

""
I only knew you for a few hours-a nice few hours talking about nothing and everything at the same time. A nice few hours of you aggressively kissing me and I pretending like I didn't like it because I was scared. You were so beautiful in your silence and candor. I might've fallen in love with you if you had shown me more but I'm glad you didn't. You're leaving soon. I can't help but think you probably were indifferent about me once you saw me in the daylight. My tired eyes and pale skin and makeup running all over my face. My hair that has lost its beauty and my bruised veins that have been poked at too much this semester by nurses and doctors trying to figure me out. That's why I was reluctant.

I regret not being different that night. But I won't regret that I chose you to be the first man I had touched after months of deep depression and self-loathing--the aftermath of what my last relationship did to me. 

You were a step on the way to being me again.
And as I sing along to Amy and Lana I'll remember you as that distant what could've been. """

FUCK EATING DISORDERS. It has literally impacted my year so much. I missed classes, hours and hours of studying, I missed homecoming, dragon day, missed out on making more than a few aloof friends. When I see a guy get pasta for dinner without a second thought without worrying how much oil is in the sauce or someone get a smoothie to be healthy while I watch them drink 400 calories of fructose, I wish that I was my ignorant young self again. I've done so much therapy, it's just all physical. I'm never full. Even after eating 10000 calories I am still not satisfied. Eating just makes me hungrier, every day is waiting for the next meal. Every day is tea, gum, coffee, running, anything to curb my hunger. Even at a near fatal bmi I was still scared of getting fat. People think that anorexics hate food. The truth is we LOVE food. We love it so much that we are scared of it. At my worst I was reading recipes in between sets at the gym and listening to food podcasts on the treadmill for hours. I honestly don't think it will ever go away but I hope one day it will no longer control me. It's so hard to get help from a friend for an eating disorder, especially as a dude like myself. If someone tries to help my ED tumor tells me that it's a scheme to make me fat, to ruin me, that I don't need help. Phew what a rant. Anywho...ya eating disorders are fucking awful, like 100x worse than you think."

This beginning to my story is my confession
The night was dark, and the rain was penetrating my thin shirt, revealing my nipples through the cotton. I felt exposed, and every time I walked beneath a streetlight I felt like I was on Broadway with the spotlight shining right on me. My nipples were chafing and they were fully erect, like two little sharp spikes piercing through my tight shirt. They were not the only erect part of my body. 
        It was 2:55 AM, and I was shivering. I was on my way back from White Castle, where I devoured 14, moist burgers. My stomach was nice and plump and my gut was clearly exposed through my tight cotton Hanes shirt. 
        I heard a car screech from behind me and I looked back, mouth agape, eyes wide, and nipples fully erect. The lights of the car were speeding towards me, and I began running hastily; I’ve always been a speedy man. I won many competitions in school and I was once the fastest man alive in the state of South Dakota, even though I lived in New York.
        Nevertheless, I was not as fast as the Cadillac XTS. They slammed the breaks next to me and two hooded, big, muscular, intimidating yet intimate men exited the car and knocked me over the head. I do not remember what happened after that.

My friend is found love and he wants to tell me all about it. I want to be happy for him but honestly I just don't care. Maybe it's because I don't have love or this love is one sided and I don't know how to tell him but I can't find it in myself to care. Does that make me a bad person?"

I've noticed that attractive girls tend to have slightly different facebook names than their real names. Like if their name is Rachel Johnson, their facebook name would be Rach Jo or something like that. Is this because they are trying to avoid getting lots of requests from horny guys? That's been my assumption, so I just haven't been sending friend requests to people like that, to avoid seeming like a creep. But if that's not the reason maybe I should change that approach.

Today I gave my number to this one girl I like. Normally this is a good thing, right? Putting myself out there to see where things go, if anything. Sure, but after my friends and I did a bit of Googling, it turns out that she's a devout Christian. It's not the fact that she's Christian that makes this awkward; it's the fact that she's someone who is ""100% not going to be interested in a lesbian relationship with the least religious person ever"" that makes this awkward. So the 0.01% chance I thought I had was more like a 0% chance ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Moral of the story: google who you like BEFORE giving away your number!"

Four years ago in high school, a girl who I looked up to called me out as a creep and as annoying in the middle of class (among other insults). It's an event that stuck with me. Now, I'm starting to think she's right. I thought that coming here would be a good place to have a fresh start, to begin anew. For the first couple of years, things were going alright, Now, I've noticed increased hostility towards me, most likely from my own actions. People don't seem to want to hang around me. The same patterns are repeating, like they did four years ago. I know it won't be long before a spark lights the power keg and everything comes crashing down again. I just thought things would be different. I guess not. maybe it's just how I am. No matter what I do, how hard I try, the end result will be the same. She were right. I am a creep. I am someone no one wants to hang around."

I am disappointed in myself. I wasn't very careful or thoughtful on what classes to take first semester, and ended up taking two classes that I didn't like very much, were too difficult for me, and aren't even that relevant to what I want to major in now anyway. I didn't have to take them. I'm a freshman by the way. I don't feel like explaining why I chose those two classes, but I had good reasons at the time. Because I got low grades in these two classes, my first semester gpa wasn't good. Oh well, at least grades from other classes will offset these scores. I learned a lot from this experience, which I am grateful for. But I can't ignore the fact that those two grades will always be on my record. And I'm still mad at myself. This makes me sad."

To #7604 about the person's dad not approving of him going to college & feeling stifled. Sorry in advance for the long post. 

I just want to say that I understand what you are going through. Half of the time, I feel defiant and assured that I am doing the right thing for my own happiness. The other half of the time I feel guilty because my parents do not support what I am doing. I am interning in a field I am interested in and learning a lot, however not earning any money. My parent's mantra, almost every night without fail: ""get a government job, they're stable."" I KNOW, without a doubt, that it is not what I want to do. That I would be bored out of my mind.

The turning point in my thinking came when I went with my friend & his lifelong pet to the vet. This dog was his best friend, and it turned out that her condition was so bad she had to be put down. I've never seen him so vulnerable in his entire life, and the one thing that struck me was that he said: ""I should have treated her better, yelled at her less, let her go outside when she wanted to.."" He was filled with so much regret that he could have been the cause of even a little bit of unhappiness in her life. 

I guess my point is that you have the option to work with your dad doing physical labor, but in the end and in the long run, will your dad regret that he held you back from your happiness?"

From my observations, academia, in a nutshell, is where you go to study everything that's wrong with world. This is neither good nor bad, it just is. I mean, it makes sense to study issues or you'd be wasting your time, trying to keep things as they are.

Yah I understand people need to love themselves in their own way, but for those who are make-up free, keep rockin it. For those who put make-up on ""I hope that you don't take it wrong""."

I'm a Junior gov/econ double major in A&S and I'm freaking out because I haven't taken any language or science requirements and I can't see any way to finish them in the next two semesters on top of finishing up other requirements. I'm so so so scared they're going to kick me out if I can't finish my requirements by spring :( What do I do? I have never heard of anyone staying as a super senior to finish up requirements and my advising deans are pressuring me to stay this summer, but I really don't want to give up an internship I already have.

To #8023:

You are definitely not alone. There are plenty of normal people that choose to have sex only with people that they care about. I'm a (straight) guy, fairly social, fairly attractive (at least that's what yo momma said-jk jk!) and have received a decent amount of attention from the opposite sex, as well as a few advances from members of the same sex. I've had 1 one-night-stand (freshman year) and it sucked ass (no pun intended) and I felt incredibly dirty (in a bad way) afterwards. I never tried hooking up again. Multiple friends of mine have had similar experiences and the few that won't come out and decry the hook-up scene have still seen some shit. Oh and these guys aren't exactly the religious type either (I think most are either agnostic-atheist or irreligious) and they have pretty active social lives--student athletes, club leaders, student government positions, project teams, etc.

Luckily, I found a girl about a year and a half after the incident. She shares the same views on sex as me and we're planning on getting engaged after graduation. The conversation was pretty difficult to bring up; but at the appropriate time I made clear my views and hoped for the best. The point is, there are definitely a good amount of people who don't buy in to the whole hook-up culture--(guys and girls, straight and otherwise) and I don't think that they're all religious freaks either. 

For the record, while I don't judge or partake in slut-shaming individuals, I definitely agree that promiscuity is not a positive character trait. It's probably not a deal-breaker for me (after all the heart wants what it wants), but I always think twice before dating a girl who's...been around the neighborhood. It signifies that the individual doesn't value sex as an act of intimacy and love. Many people are able to separate the two--sex and love--or at least convince themselves that they have. But I don't think the two can be so easily uncoupled--at least, it can't for me and many of my friends. 

I hope you find your special someone fellow Cornellian. Just try to expand your horizons and look elsewhere rather than among a specific subset of the student populace that is notorious for one-night stands and risky behavior."

Has anyone had success working at internships in NYC during the year? Obviously it would be a very stressful semester and it would be nearly impossible if you have labs and such classes.

I believe things made back then were built much better which less planned obsolesce. America was a massive industrial power where people had good paying manufacturing jobs, especially under the Eisenhower era. I think people were much nicer back then too.

""Beware guys, something I've recently noticed regarding complimenting girls is, it is an incredibly risky thing to do that can completely backfire and cause them to lose interest. The thing to note is, it is really counterintuitive, at least to me, so you may be thinking you're putting in a lot of effort to come up with the right/specific compliments and you're being sweet, when in fact you are obliviously destroying your chances.

Here's what it is -- do not compliment a girl on something she isn't 100% sure you know about her. Don't say, """"I think you're genuinely sweet"""" or something like that if you don't think she thinks you have a basis for that, even if in your mind you have a basis. Because here's what will very likely happen - she'll think (or say) how can you possibly know this about me? Don't make sweeping judgements. You don't know me. She might think you're being too intense. And another thing she might say is - you can't set such expectations for me, I'll end up being disappointing, it's unfair because you don't know me, etc. Of course it depends on the compliment, but this is the general idea.

And the thing is for myself, and I think most guys, none of this crosses my mind. I just wanted to distinguish myself from the crowd, I wanted you to notice me, I wanted to be sweet and clever, and the compliment IS based on some fact, I don't just throw them around. But you must be extremely cautious. In fact it may be better to compliment looks than personality.
I've had this response 5-6 times now to what I considered to be reasonable compliments. It can also come across as being aggressive, which combined with everything else will turn her off to you quickly. This is all of course for the courting stage, if you're complimenting your girlfriend, she will most likely take it as a compliment and not an expectation.

You just need to be casual and cautious with your kind words. That is my downfall - I am intense as much as I try not to be. If I sense someone losing interest, I start telling them why I like them and get into try hard mode and that backfires quickly. But often even if she wasn't losing interest, intensity will cost you. It's almost always a losing strategy, unless she absolutely adores you, it will scare her away, and she may even think you're creepy. So never take anything too seriously, no matter how much you like her. It's really difficult. But realize you'll be working against yourself, and try to use the right part of your brain. Save romantic and more intense stuff for the relationship. In the beginning, you have to be casual (albeit polite and still interested) as much as possible. And beware if compliments."""

It doesn't seem to be unreasonable to ask for. I put myself out there, and I would have no clue how to ask someone out but I would probably say yes to anybody who asked. I just want companionship.

And it really is because I have crippling anxiety and I am not myself the first few times I meet someone, especially if I really like them. And 90% of the girls I go out with I really like... maybe because I've never been given a chance and the loneliness has lowered my standards. I wish they wouldn't agree to go out with me in the first place, but weirdly I must have just enough appeal to warrant a 1st date, but not nearly enough to warrant anything else. And that happening consistently over no less than 100  dates will really wear you down. Guys, if you're getting rejected at the asking out stage, be thankful. After you've gone out and you've developed a crush and you've entered the hope zone, it'll make you much sadder to get one of those texts. To see someone go from trying and seeming to have an interest to completely discarding you like a stick of gum hurts. I wish people would give second chances, but alas 99% of the population seems to think they can fully gauge someone's dating potential and compatibility after an hour-long conversation where neither person is really themselves.

I actually have no idea what it would be like to have someone maintain interest. I see people together and I wonder what the heck they did that I'm not doing. And among their numbers are hordes of blithering idiots, a lot of whom I see with women I'd tried to get in the sweetest and smartest possible way.

I only support American jobs now by purchasing union-made products and services that my brothers and sisters make or take part in. I make sure my morning snack of donuts is made by the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers, and Grain Millers International Union (BCTGM). My lunch is union-made by the local Italian restaurant.

""I love Cornell and I love the College of Engineering. I just wish that it was more focused on preparing me to be an informed citizen and knowledgeable engineer rather than a potential employee. I’m a freshman in Engineering and I’m trying to figure out my next 3 years here. 

Ever since I started looking at colleges, I knew I wanted to study abroad. I chose Cornell knowing that my financial aid package would carry over and that there were hundreds of places I could go. My cousins and brother have told amazing stories of their experiences studying in Bogotá, London, and Nepal, and they all are still in contact with the friends they made. I came to this school expecting that I could also have an experience like this. 

Yet, the way that my program is designed, I have only one semester I could study abroad: Junior Spring. This is fine, I would definitely love to go then. But if I study abroad then, I won’t finish school in May, more likely I’ll finish in June when most international programs end. And then I won’t be able to have an internship before my senior year. My adviser says that having an internship then is essential to getting a job after graduation. (Also, it should be said that I’ll be working full time this summer and nearly full time on winter break, so I don’t think I could do it then either)
So now I don’t know what to do. Do I (as cliché as it sounds) follow the dream I’ve had since middle school or suck it up and take the route that will “make me more employable” in the future?"""

Are there actually college guys who don't sleep around? I get it. I really enjoy sex but I prefer it in a monogamous relationship. I think it's kinda gross when a guy has sex with multiple girls consistently. There are guys I know who've hooked up with a bunch of girls in my sorority and i think that's super weird and honestly kind of dangerous in terms of STDs. Sex seems so much better when you care about the person and when you feel comfortable with them. I don't mean to place judgement, but I want to know when I have sex with a guy that he's not just fucking every person with a vagina. And honestly I'm sick of the objectification and entitlement when it comes to sex here on campus. Maybe I just dont know where to find people who feel the same way (besides I guess church) or maybe they dont exist. Are there any guys who feel similarly to how I feel or am I just completely old fashioned?"

I'm a minority studies minor, but I think it's important to recognize the issues with international students in US schools in the past decade. Schools are eager to accept them in order to get more money- especially Cornell. Beyond that, many countries have issues with bribes in relation to fixing test scores, GPAs, recommendations, etc. Seeing international students watch American shows with subtitles of their mother tongue seems to reinforce those issues- or maybe the TOEFL is just an inadequate basis of language skills. Regardless, international students are great, but should get in based on merit. Those students who barely try to speak English for the 4 years that there here have no good right to be here. This is not a condemnation of those with poor language skills, but one of those who don't try, and likely got into this school for the wrong reasons."

""I can't ever hold a feeling for someone.

But in the end, it just goes.  It's actually been worrying me for a long time, but I hate saying it because it sounds so stupid and trivial compared to other problems even I might face.  What if I never like anyone long enough to get married?  What if everything is just a bust for my feelings?  You can't just make yourself feel something right?

In the past couple weeks, I've walked past conversations where I hear 22 years old exacerbated at how ""old"" they are. In my passing their conversations, I also know that they're graduating. And they're marveling at how fast the time has passed. I'm a adult learner at Cornell, so I not only have some perspective on age, but a deep appreciate for the passage of time. Trust me, as each year, 5 years 10 years, wow! where did 20 years go!?!? that pass, your wonder about it will continue to grow. Right now you might think that you can't imagine being 30 or 40 or 50 or 60. How far can we go? 100? I recently heard that a 96 year old Holocaust survivor recently applied to Cornell!!!! The difference between lamenting about the passage of time and embracing it will be your attitude, your ability to adjust to changing circumstances, your openness to other people's worldviews (we all want the same things, we just have varying means), and your willingness to continue learning. Do I think I know it all? Do I think ""it's all about me""? No and no. I trust you to find your truth. I know you'll continue to try to make this world a better place for everyone.

I piss my liberal friends the most after I graduated from Cornell several years ago. I never show off, but I noticed I started losing a lot of liberal Facebook friends after people find out about my success. It seems they are just jealous and it's quite common with leftists. After Cornell, I realized how to pay the least taxes by living in a state where there is no income tax. I also live in a state where I can own any firearms I want, including full auto machine guns, and I can even conceal carry to protect my family and friends. I work on capital projects and made a six figure salary right out of college ($123,000 a year to be exact). I now make $135,000 plus bonuses and company benefits. I invest that money and make 3-4 times my salary. I own a nice Corvette, an H3, and a Hellcat. I own nice shoes that I polish myself, since I cannot trust anyone to shine my own shoes. I belong to a beautiful country club and have many nice conservative friends who would do anything for me. I isolate myself from idiots and the majority of people I consider to be the ""lowest common denominator."" I have a nice girl friend who's getting married with me soon and I just put a down payment on a new house with 50 acres of land, a nice salt water swimming pool and cedar sauna and hot tub. I am living the American Dream and yeah my house is surrounded by a nice tall iron wrought fence with spikes on the top to keep the riff raff away from my house and property. Thank you Cornell for starting me up on the route of success. It pays off to work hard, stay determined, and to believe in the power of capitalism. If you don't quit and have perseverance, you will never be a loser. One day capitalism will reward you too if you stay true to yourself!"

""Today I learned that a guy who went to school with my older brother is a sales director at a 10+ year old startup that has over 50 million over 4 rounds of funding. The guy graduated at the bottom tier of our high school class, went to nyit, and basically joined the company as one of the first 5 employees straight out of college in a sales function role. The company hasnt been very profitable yet and Im sure he only just started making good money (100k+) recently with the latest round of funding that took place early this year. The guy is in his early 30s and the company was founded by an Ivy Leaguer over a decade ago. My brother graduated from MIT and works as top engineer at a great software firm. He makes pretty good money for his age and my mom and I are really proud of him. Although I wasnt as smart as my brother, I still worked hard and excelled compared to my peers. We're the sons of a low income immigrant (as is the sales employee in question) and have basically had to study and crawl our way to where we are today. 

I never thought I would be an elitist, prizing my pedigree and future salary above all else. I always believed that a school pedigree and a job are things that can be achieved with hard work. I know that there are many intelligent people who didnt go to college and many intelligent state school grads working at awesome companies. But I always thought they would be exceptional people who acquired inordinate amounts of knowledge and expertise in their fields to shine through. Basically what gave them success is what got most Ivy and sans Ivy Leaguers into college in the first place--hard work.

 But it hurt so fucking bad when I read about this sales guy. I dont know how much equity he has. But if it's another WhatsApp, which it might, he could potentially end up being worth over 100 million. I looked and searched thoroughly about him to see if he somehow wised up after high school and had some crazy accomplishments that caused the founders to hire him when he graduated 9 years ago. But I couldnt find anything. Why is life so cruel and unforgiving to many, yet so rewarding to those who deserve it least? Am I the sinner in this painting, because I envy a half-wit's success? I know my brother and I will never make that sort of money. And even if we do, this guy, in joining a memorable and profitable team, has still beat out the vast majority of engineers and inventors and businessmen in history, who are undoubtedly of a high caliber intellect, by being at the right place at the right time. Why should he succeed where so many others have not? Why can't I get over this??????"

As I am getting ready to graduate, I keep reflecting on my time here. I liked it. It had ups and downs but overall, I am better for the experience. If I were to give one piece of advice, it would be to take action to minimize regrets. I've had a crush on a girl in ep since sophomore year. I didn't do anything and now we're going to graduate and that's probably my biggest regret. Don't let fear creep into your mind. Be confident in yourself or at least work toward it because its progress. Fear weakens and paralyzes you. Don't let it. It's only now that I'm realizing that life is too short for regrets. I'm not saying you have to be a positive, upbeat person every day because that's not possible. Just keep your mind on the positives as much as you can and take risks because you're young and regrets suck."

""For the first time since I was 8, I've gone without masturbating for more than 2 days. My average since age 8 is probably around 1.5 times a day. And 8 is a bit of an arbitrary marker, I honestly don't remember when I started -- I believe it was before 8. Some of my first memories ever were rubbing my penis on the couch, bed, etc. and I had no idea what I was doing or why I was doing it, but I remember hiding because I knew I wasn't supposed to be caught, and I remember associating it with girls somehow, but not at all clear on how or why -- this was way before I even knew about kissing -- and I remember the feeling of orgasm, which felt like this great tingling sensation going up to my anus, but of course nothing came out. I also always took off my pants when I did it... I honestly think I was 6-7.

But I digress. It's the first time I've managed to stop, and it took a LOT of willpower to do it. I am on day 5 and my testicles are really swollen and hurt, my entire worldview and thinking has completely changed. I have more confidence and less anxiety and I cannot stop thinking about sex for the life of me. The spectrum of what I consider attractive has expanded greatly. Nearly every female I run into on campus I find very attractive and regret not trying to talk to. It's a challenge to think about anything else, so staying focused in class has been difficult. Not staring is also a challenge, but I am doing an okay job with that for now.

Not sure if this is some initial period I am supposed to power through, but I am determined to go at least a week, and then maybe do it once and go for another week or more.  My balls are really swollen and hurt a lot, and the pain is going up to my stomach. So if that gets unbearable, I'll end this first streak.

But wow, it's been odd and difficult, and also a crazy adventure of self-discovery. The effects reach far beyond your reproductive system it's amazing. One thing that's happened is I've started to have vivid dreams every night. Not sexual dreams, just regular dreams, but very intense. I never used to have dreams ever. I've also become less jaded, and more aware and appreciative of things in general. And lastly, boy do I have more time. I never realized how much time I spent watching porn and jerking off before. I easily have an additional 90 mins to 2 hours a day now into my schedule. Try it guys, unless you have rape tendencies, then don't because you may not be able to deal with the side effects..."""

""I'm a Cornell student and voting for Trump. I'm (obviously) posting this anonymously, and the fact that I feel the need to do this should be enough to understand why I'm voting for Trump. I always thought I would vote Democrat because most of my views tend to be pretty liberal and I absolutely do think Trump would make an awful president, but I think something needs to be done to put a stop to the liberal PC police, and if burning Washington to the ground by electing Trump is the only option than so be it. Liberals need to learn that people are allowed to have opinions that disagree with them, and you can't simply use shrill cries of """"bigot"""" and """"racist"""" to shut down any dissent. Wanting to enforce our borders or turn away refugees does not make you a racist. Opposing abortion does not make you a sexist. There are certainly valid arguments for taking in refugees and protecting abortion rights, and I'm fine with those who make them, but just shaming anyone who disagrees into silence by tying everything to racism or sexism is a more terrifying form of fascism than anything Trump brings to the table. More terrifying, of course, because it is already here.

Think about it. When Bernie Sanders visited Liberty University, an extremely conservative campus, to give a speech, they showed up and listened respectfully, without protesting or trying to silence him or violence. If Trump announced that he was coming to speak here, do you really expect that Cornell students would provide him that same respectful treatment?

""This white student union person is an obvious troll. But the fact that people are getting so mad about it is absurd.

The people spending so much time and energy complaining about white people, and then insult 'our' culture as non existant need to get a grip.

A. Which white culture? English? French? Italian? Russian? Spanish? Greek? I may be white but I have nothing to do with any of those cultures.

B. You're just acting like the troll if you go around putting down 'white' (broad spectrum of people there) culture as nonexistant. 

I'm German so I'll just go with German stuff, Polka, Alpining, Pretzels, Opera (started in Italy, made great in Germany), a vast chunk of the world's knowledge of chemistry and astronomy, helicopters, text messaging, the computer, etc.

Women have this incredible power over men in that they are bottlenecks/gatekeepers of men's horniness and desire for emotional attachment. They get to decide -- I'll let this one talk to me, I'll shut this one down, and the other 95% interested I'll send mixed signals to, and I'll date this one for 4 dates and then out of nowhere stop communicating, etc. Sexually frustrated men are a force to be reckoned with, and a lot of suffering in the world is the direct or indirect product of that. To men it's similar to starvation and they either destroy themselves or others if they can't get ahead in the competition for women. But beware ladies, because a day will come when guys will figure out a way to circumvent this issue - the sex aspect, the emotional comfort aspect, and possibly even the reproduction aspect, and when you're put in direct competition with man-made (literally) technology, you'll see all the social equality progress to go crap, and without your biological value you won't be left with much. And that may just be the end of our civilization. So don't abuse your power... Be straightforward, date the ones you like, be less ambiguous with those you don't, and help us minimize relationship and sexual frustration, because that may just end humankind."

Evolution shaped us to be gene vessels. Then some crazy fluke resulted in a neocortex affording a whole other range of experiences. The result -- never a moment's rest from these two aspects of myself fighting. Humans are quite literally fucked up in the head. All of our problems come from these internal struggles and lack of organization. Shit just happens in your head, you can't reliably predict it, you can't control it, you just have to deal with it.

To the girl who thinks that white culture is bigoted and imperialistic: think about who built the amazing infrastructure we use today. The answer is white men like Thomas Edison, Samuel Rea, Cornelius Vanderbilt, Dwight D. Eisenhower, and Alexander Graham Bell. White men are the reason why you have clean water, why you can use the great transportation networks our country and the world has, why you can use a telephone to make calls seamlessly, why you can write letters via the post office to anyone in the US and around the world, and why your drinking water does not have giardia and fecal coliforms.  These great men are my heroes and I look up to them and the past as my inspiration to make America great again. Also think about the beautiful buildings, railroads, and tunnels that were built as a result of these great men. You should pay more homage to these men and this is why we have a Union of White Students at Cornell to celebrate and propagate our great culture. We have people of different backgrounds who come pay homage to our culture. White music culture is also beautiful. I know you probably find rap music and the other losers fascinating, but we prefer Frank Sinatra, Perry Como, or Frankie Avalon, while we have a whiskies on the rocks at our union meetings."

I feel you, because I am a Cornell alumnus who also works at a government agency dealing with the public. I have come to the conclusion that a large majority of people are mentally ill in this country. Many people are like drones. They do not have a purpose in life unfortunately rather than to get up, get dressed, and go to school or work, have sex, and repeat. I'm sorry I'm cynical, but it's true. That or they are ingesting large amounts of mercury, lead, and cadmium in their diets or lifestyles, because they exhibit the symptoms of heavy metal poisoning. A lot of larger cities have old piping and the water often contains heavy metals such as lead. Also, marijuana is often grown in volcanic soils which have a lot of mercury and many young people smoke it. Cadmium is present in cigarettes too. Working in a government run drug recovery facility, I can attest to the fact that the facility is nothing more than a waste of tax payer funds. I feel bad, but it provides me for a good paying job. Drug addicts will never recover and all their misery provides for me is job security."

To #7887, I was in your situation last semester. I never fully opened up to my boyfriend at the time but he knew I was going through some stuff. Throughout that time I was in a constant anixety that if he knew how bad I was feeling, he wouldn't want to deal with me anymore. We winded up breaking up for other reasons mainly because the relationship was part of the reason why I was feeling so unlovable. Often people see me as confident and carefree when I carry these feelings that no one really cares about me around. But I guarantee you people do care about you! Everyone is in their own little world here but even if you can't tell your friends exactly how you feel, I bet if you told your closest ones and your boyfriend they would be shocked and would support you. We need to learn how to be vulnerable. Don't be afraid to speak to the people who actually do love you. They have no idea how you're feeling and as such, they think you don't need help and are too concerned with other cornell obligations. Don't fret- I felt everything you're feeling now and a whole bunch of us here have. Just remember how lovable you actually are. Even when people don't say it all the time, you are important to them. And most of all, you are worthy of love! I wish I could message you directly, but see I don't have the complete guts to be vulnerable either which is a shame, because when you are vulnerable you are free. Never be ashamed of what you feel because your feelings are valid even if they don't reflect the truth. Good luck!"

Just want to make a quick comment about ""fuckboys"" of this generation. Why do so many guys feel like it's okay to treat girls like they are just objects without feelings?? Even if you're a heartless bitch, doesn't mean that everyone else is the same way, so please be considerate of others' feelings. Life is so hard on its own and I feel like the least we can do as decent beings is to be kind to one another, as cheesy as that may sound. Whether it be a small or grand act, everything goes a long way and can avoid bringing someone that unnecessary emotional burden. I speak from experience and it was (and still isn't) easy to fully recover from being treated like shit. It's not easy at all. To whomever is reading this, I sincerely just ask you not to treat people like shit."

Just my story, skip on ahead if you don't like to see posts about mental health issues. Cornell is to put it simply an amazing school with awesome opportunities and great people, but it was not the right time for me to be there.  I dealt with depression and anxiety for most of my time there and it was hard having to balance school work, home problems, and a social life all while being constantly depressed and anxious. For a long time I refused to see how sick I really was, I always believed that the next semester would be better, that I would get through it, that it wasn't a big deal if I didn't do this one assignment.  I didn't want to be the depressed kid I didn't want any of my friends or family to know that I was struggling. I was afraid.  I ended up failing more than half of my classes and I knew that I had to do something, so I went to Gannett.  Gannett has helped lots of people I know that, but in my case I feel that they didn't do enough for me. My therapist I guess tried to make me feel better but it always backfired because they always made me feel like shit about being a bad student. The therapist's priority was that I be a good student (how can we get you to go to class this week mentality), when for me at the time I was just trying to keep it together as a person.  The only good thing this therapist did for me was to suggest that I take a health leave. To any of you struggling I am sure you have heard this from one of your advisors or doctors, and if you are anything like me you were probably crushed.  A leave?  I felt like a disappointment, a failure, I had so much guilt because I would have to leave. My family worked so hard, hell I worked so hard to get here just for my stupid depression to destroy everything. Thats how it felt at the time.  Telling my family was hard, telling my friends I was taking a year off was hard, but it was the best thing I ever did for myself.  I couldn't see it at the time but I needed help.  I've been away from Cornell for almost a year now and honestly its been great because I've gained a lot of perspective and most importantly I have been getting better. Seeing a new therapist who has no connection to Cornell is amazing because they don't judge me, and they are treating me as a person not a student.  I can honestly say that I am much happier now and although I don't know when I will be going back to Cornell, I know that I will go back eventually and I will be in a much better place. So I guess what I'm trying to say is that if you are struggling academically or mentally at Cornell, don't give up on yourself.  Tell your friends about what is going on, they love you and will help you. Seek help, whatever that may be whether its Gannett or a doctor elsewhere, or even tutoring.  Lots of people struggle here but we are always afraid of being judged and so we hide our troubles, but that just hurts us more in the long run.   Don't be afraid to take a leave, it will be hard emotionally, but it will be for the better.  I definitely wish there was a bigger support network for people struggling academically due to health issues on campus.  And I definitely wish someone had told me that it was ok if my life plan didn't go as I wanted it to go. Oh and remember that you are more than your transcripts and that you are more than your mental illness, you are worthy and you are lovable."

""I was almost one year and a half clean from self injury. But I got so close today. So close. For a long time I thought those feelings were behind me, that I have already out grown the past.

And I got so close to picking up the old habit again. And I felt ashamed.

There's something I've noticed in abortion debates. Pro-choicers in arguments with pro-lifers always bring up how banning abortions would be an attack on women's rights in the form of denying them bodily autonomy, place women who can't support children in poverty, further traumatize pregnant rape survivors, etc. Now as a pro-choicer, I believe that these are absolutely important, legitimate issues. However, in the specific context of an argument with a pro-lifer, bringing any of that up is utterly irrelevant. Why? Because the other person literally believes that abortion is baby murder. They are not going to consider baby murder to be a human right. They are not going to think subjecting someone to poverty is worse than baby murder. Even the prospect of traumatizing rape survivors, horrible as that is, pales in comparison to baby murder. What should actually be the main point in an argument like this is the issue of personhood - what it is and when it begins, that aborted fetuses are not persons. If you're gonna attempt the almost insurmountable task of convincing someone on the other side of an issue as controversial as abortion to your side, you should at least first and foremost fully and truly understand how they think."

It's funny how so many people don't think the Union of White Students at Cornell is real. I am a member and we meet in secret to protect our identities for fear of attack. It's a shame we cannot exercise our right to free speech, because we do not fit the liberal credo. We are not affecting anyone or advocating any violence, just a preservation of white culture and values. We welcome students from all walks of life and all races, colors, and creeds that would like to join in our mission. If there are other race-related clubs on campus, we will have a club to promote our European race and culture too."

I've had it with everyone and everything here. It's my last semester of my senior year and I'm not enjoying any of it. All I want is to get the hell out of here and move on with my life. I'll be grateful to finally have my degree and be done with school, but aside from my degree and education I can't think of anything positive that I'll be taking with me. It's a little depressing to think about - it's not for lack of trying. I joined a sorority, joined clubs...I just didn't make any deep connections and honestly won't miss anyone here."

""I don't understand why the Black Student United feels the need to change the name of the plantations. The word plantation is """"a group of trees that have been planted together"""". The history of the Cornell plantations was """"an arboretum of rare specimen trees and a conservatory for teaching botany"""". The name seems to fit. The plantations are literally a place where plants were planted. 

The BSU accomplishes so many things that are sorely needed (need-blind admission, minority support, etc). I can't believe they are hanging their hat on this issue. And yes, before you all attack me, I am underrepresented minority but I am embarrassed to be associated with a group that overlooks pressing social issues to focus on meaningless titles."""

Back in the day before the drug revolution of the late 60's only the top students made it to Cornell. Today everyone fells entitled about everything and receives second chances. If you failed a semester and flunked out of Cornell, you entered the workforce or entered the military. There was no in between. It's unfortunate how many chances this younger generation gets. As an alumnus who had to work hard to attend Cornell in the early 60's, I am deeply ashamed of what has become of my alma mater."

There is a student organization on campus which discriminates people based on race. The members were originally in another group and formed their own group because they didn't want to dance with people of a different race, or even those from different country.

Before I become friends with anyone, including those at Cornell, I run background checks by interviewing them about their personal life non-chalanty, and by checking local, state, and federal databases where they have resided in the past to see if anything shows up. I like to be safe than sorry. I like to collect people's fingerprints too without their consent and without them noticing, by giving them things to handle and return to me. I have never failed by checking people out before associating with them. It helps avoid potential safety concerns in the long term. I know that it worked for me when I met my girlfriend and as a result we have been together for seven years already."

After graduating Cornell, I now work at a government agency and I have to deal with some of the dumbest people in the world. I am surprised that some of these people are alive and breathing because their IQ levels are so low. I try my best to help them, but they are wrong and try to accuse me of giving them wrong information, because they don't like to hear what I have to tell them. I go by the book with everything and they wish that I bend the rules for them. It's rather sad how much entitlement I see among those people who deserve nothing."

Sometimes when I'm alone in bed I get extremely sad because I feel like nobody cares about me. I'm afraid to tell people about my problems because I fear judgement. My friends probably think I'm always happy, confident, and carefree. In reality I am so scared about my future and self conscious about every aspect of myself. My thoughts are so pessimistic and cynical. But I can't tell anyone anything because I personally wouldn't want to talk to someone like that. Nobody can help me. I tried CAPS, but they didn't offer much help. I revert back into my previous mental state as soon as I leave that place. I don't want to tell my friends. I don't want to tell my boyfriend either, since I feel like if I start depending on him too much, he'll think I'm needy and leave me. So I'm stuck feeling miserable and unable to help myself."

I am also a young guy in college and am pretty conservative when it comes to sex--I see it as an intimate moment to be shared with someone you care and love. But in my group of friends, I'm the odd man out. I'm pretty sure all of the guys I'm friends with make fun of me behind my back for not trying to score every time we go out and making ""virgin"" jokes when I'm not around. I'm not particularly religious, but thus is just something I value.

My first time was amazing and with my girlfriend in high school. Now that I'm in college, I feel like I'll never find someone who shares the same values. It's either they're super religious, or extremely open about sex and have racked up in the triple digits by graduation. Am I making a mistake by not experimenting? I want to live and die by the arbitrary principles I've made for myself. But I hope that won't mean having to die alone and penniless or having to settle down with some girl who has the exact opposite views."

I don't know what to do anymore. TAs, peers and professors say that an Ivy League school would make you automatically more competitive than other applicants, but that's almost never true in the real world. Taking more classes, getting involved in multiple leadership roles, having a passion toward your field of study doesn't even mean better internships when you see people in your major with almost no extracurricular involvement and professional experience getting into your dream company. Maybe it's best then to drop out of here and go to a community college instead, maybe that'll be more successful and make me seem more ""compatible"" anyway."

I dropped out of Cornell and went into Marines a few years ago because I realized that Cornell was really full of shit and I was not getting anything out of the education here. After joining I have obtained a positive outlook on life, became more physically and mentally fit, and was able to build up my life and live the ""American Dream."" I now own a house and in a few months I am getting married to my beautiful girlfriend of two years. I can look to the future in a positive manner, knowing that my friends and I are contributing to the safety of this country. It saddens to see many negative posts on this site, pertaining to suicide or self pity. I wish I can offer the same advice and experiences I have had to these people and let them know that Cornell is not everything. You can do well without a college degree and be happy. In fact, I am getting a college degree in engineering as I am writing this, so enlisting is not the end. The school's name does not really mean much in the greater sense when looking for jobs. The Marines have allowed me to get a degree in a more relaxed setting. I work as an electrician now and the skills I am obtaining will help me gain the experience necessary to transition to the civilian sector in the years to come as an electrical engineer. When I was a student at Cornell, I've noticed the professors were lacking and often care more about research than teaching. Students at Cornell are not necessarily smarter than students elsewhere, because many lack hands-on and practical knowledge. Learning theory is fine, but without practice, you are not going to make it in the real world outside of academia. I've noticed that some of my buddies who had a hard time in high school enlisted and gained a better work ethic than even my peers at Cornell had in the military. The military will keep you busy and it's a life changing experience. So if you are struggling and want a change in your routine, consider enlisting or doing something else like I did and maybe it can save your life like it did mine. I think life is far more important than dying over some bullshit school. Anyways Semper Fi to any Marines ROTC students at Cornell! I respect you and your passion a lot."

I feel as though someone who has been very close to me for a long time has been making me feel guilty a lot lately.  It's weird because I have been doing great lately but every once in a while I get zapped with negativity. The only reason I feel guilty is because these messages/signals keep appearing.  It feels like this person is holding onto something and not giving me unconditional love as I have always given to them and always will.

Sometimes I feel as if I don't deserve my boyfriend. It's a running theme whenever I'm super drunk, which hasn't happened often. He's just one of those brilliant and friendly people who can get along with anyone. Everyone just loves him. Meanwhile I'm the shallow judgmental mediocre bitch who sits in the corner. We share a similar friend/acquaintance  group and I know that most people only know of me through him. He's so much more attractive than I am. And sometimes I think the only reason I think we ever got together is because I'm his first relationship. He was extremely shy and I was the only one of us confident enough to make the first move. I  know he loves but I can't help but feel he probably deserves someone who is actually on his level."

The neighbors directly below my apartment are unimaginably awful, and I don't know what else to do about it. They're constantly playing (from about 9 am-4 am) loud, thumping music so that my roommate and I can't study or sleep. I bought earplugs, which I wear all the time now, but even the floor separating us and earplugs combined don't block out the sound or the vibrations. They have people over several times a week, and are frequently outside shouting at each other at 1, 2, or even 4 am. Our neighbors have contacted our landlord and called the cops on them several times, but nothing has changed. They have had their garbage piling up outside our front door for 2 months now. It smells awful, and animals have been tearing into the bags, leaving used tampons, tissues, and half-eaten chicken wings scattered in the driveway. For a while they were even piling garbage in the stairwell to our basement, blocking access to the washing machine/dryer. And those are only a couple of the problems. We've confronted them many times, and have complained to our landlord, and nothing seems to be helping. It just sucks because we specifically moved to a quiet neighborhood downtown so that we could study and sleep more, but then our landlord sold the house to someone else who made very little effort to rent to people who would be appropriate for the neighborhood. How can some people so rude and inconsiderate?"

It's really not a big deal at your age, but get it done sooner than later because it starts to get exponentially more difficult to deal with, and you will be missing out on a crucial part of your fleeting youth. Having gone through my 20s as a virgin, I can tell you it's not fun. It's much easier to develop insecurities, it's easier to feel unwanted, your personality suffers in a lot of ways, and your motivation does too as a result. You may start to feel frustrated, grumpy and negative, and your brain will try to fight that psychologically, which will be disruptive to your normal functioning and it will mess with your academic, professional, and social priorities. It will have strong ripple effects throughout every aspect of your life. As human beings, we are naturally wired to take this very seriously -- whether you want to reproduce or not, or whatever your neocortex-placed attitude toward that aspect of life is -- the instinct is encoded into your DNA at a fundamental level as a basic need, and if you don't act on it, it will weigh very heavily on you. Looking back, I honestly wish I'd done it as a teenager. I wouldn't have had a lot of the problems I had in my 20s if I had. It's as important as having a social life and getting a good education, etc. And the relationship aspect of it is just as important as the physical, even if it's not a serious relationship. So start dating, make it a project, do not neglect a critical part of life. You're only young for a tiny fraction of what is already a very short lifespan."

""Dear TA's:
Please don't be snotty to students who come to you for help. You either a) are a grad TA and used to be an """"annoying"""" undergrad, too, or b) you're STILL an """"annoying"""" undergrad, and it may be that you're struggling with a different class that they breezed through.

Students who don't understand something and ask for help aren't dumb, or inferior to you, and despite that such an attitude is sadly pervasive throughout academia, it's a shitty attitude to have. We all got to Cornell, we all deserve to be here, and usually when we don't understand something we just need to have it explained in a different way in order to fully understand it.

To all the fabulous TA's out there, keep it up! You rock!"""

I love Cornell so much, but I hate that they put upkeep on such a low priority. Paint coming off doors, showing the metal and years of dirt, clumps of hair that's all over the floors, the years of dust build up on top of the locks and under the baskets at Helen Newman, the old nasty floors and chairs literally coming out of their bolted-down spots in lecture halls.

I am glad to have older parents who grew up in the 50's and early 60's. As a Black middle class student from Detroit, it's tough for me to go to school at Cornell and have conservative views, because I know many people that I associate with would lose respect for me and I would most likely lose the friends I have here. It's a shame that people cannot respect one another's differing views here and that I have to pretend I follow liberal views in my classes to pass the course. It seems almost like a paradox that opposing views cannot be tolerated in college, but it's quite evident here at Cornell. I wish more students were open minded here and I'm sure others have had the same issue as I have, especially those who have conservative beliefs. Many students have to hide their beliefs here unfortunately. I just want to let people know that not all Blacks think the same. We are not all liberals and that diversity is very diverse."

My girlfriend makes me feel insecure occasionally. She's so much more popular and everyone likes her while I only have a couple close friends. She's really smart and I'm a mediocre student. She's involved in a bunch of stuff and has leadership positions while I just bum around and do nothing. She's nice and considerate to everyone and I feel like I'm sometimes a dick without even realizing it. Once we graduate, she'll work in the same position as me but at a marginally more prestigious firm. I guess none of this really matters since we've been with each other for awhile and get along very well, but I still feel like I'm punching above my weight sometimes."

I feel guilty about not making an effort to hang out with the other students from my country, but I honestly don't have much in common with most of them.

""""the thought that my mind has always been the same yet people treat my ideas differently because of how I look is rather discouraging.""""

Your mind isn't the same though. Before you were """"hyperfocused on living inside your mind"""" and now you're not.

The simple truth is that being overweight correlates heavily with a ton of other stuff that people generally don't like. The causal links or lack thereof are irrelevant, an overweight person is more likely to have low self esteem, lack self control or a weak work ethic, and have less friends.

I can respect the argument that we should accept these flaws and try to treat people equally, because fitness correlates strongly with socioeconomic background and therefore discriminating based on it is regressive. But in the individual case when you lose a bunch of weight, of course people are going to treat you better. You've just shown yourself to be much stronger than you seemed before."""
325,2016-03-13 14:47:54,"7824
I used to strongly associate people's looks with their personality. I know it's silly, but on a subconscious level, if someone was ugly and/or fat, I just  thought their existence was a little sad and prioritized interacting with other people, I thought of unattractive people as losers a little bit. And the uglier/fatter someone was, the more I put them in that category. Honestly it wasn't intentional, and not in a rude way, but I just naturally gravitated toward good looking people. And I've recently managed to remove this filter from my worldview, and I have to say it's like ridding yourself of a prejudice, like racism. And it's really eye opening, you can just experience more of life b/c you're exposed to more of the human condition, just quantity-wise. I'm generally a negative person who is always looking for reasons to be unhappy -- e.g. unattractiveness, and I guess I projected/attributed this to other people. And now that I've learned to perceive them as no different than anyone else, I've become happier too. This must be how racists feel. Prejudice is like a cage for your mind... Don't do it."

Paying 20 bucks for a concert at Cornell is ridiculously cheap. Take advantage of all of these concerts that CCC sponsors, because concerts after graduation tend to be significantly pricier (i.e. Kygo, Grimes, Klingande, Family of the Year, Modest Mouse, ZHU, Formation World Tour---all concerts this past year or coming up in NYC), and even concert days such as Gov Ball, EZoo and Coachella can be very draining on your wallet."

I used to be very overweight and had no idea how to use makeup or assemble a nice outfit. I was hyperfocused on living inside my mind and ignored my body for various reasons. Now that I've learned to treat my body with kindness and have been getting much better with makeup, hair styling, etc., I am startled by the number of men who look at me as I walk by. I like feeling sexy but I'm actually rather distributed and depressed by another observation: people at work seem to take me more seriously now. Perhaps it is a combination of a new sense of confidence along with my appearance...but the thought that my mind has always been the same yet people treat my ideas differently because of how I look is rather discouraging. 

I guess I just want to put that hard truth out there and tell everyone to try to look past appearance but also take advantage of the fact that people will always be biased - consciously or subconsciously - and judge you because that's just part of what we do as a cultural and who we are as a species.

This is regarding the equal representation debate on the CS page. 

Last week, an entire group of us, men, women, guys, girls, of all color, got called bigots for not recognizing the inequality shown in the CS cover page. As a woman, at first I was like, yeah go girls. And then I realized how ridiculous the post was. I don't want women to be represented just because they are underrepresented, I was us to earn our place there as one of the top 5 loved professors in the CS department at Cornell. 

I'm very frustrated because while women here fight for feminism or any type of equality, they continue to support Greek life, one of the most sexist modern day institutions in America.

Inspired by post #7768

Similar to finding meaning in a meaningless world, I struggled with understanding the purpose of life. The conclusion I arrived at changed my life, and I hope it can help anyone who reads this.

I started with the thought that there is no inherent purpose to life. At first this seemed disappointing. What can I do? Then I realized this is liberating. I can choose my purpose to be whatever I want. I am not restricted to follow some set path. I am able to choose my own purpose, and I can change it if I want.

One of the most difficult things to do was to change what my purpose was. Long before I had come to my realization, I had a purpose I was dedicated to that wasn't really my own. It was something I strove for as a result of others around me. I chased after it for over 15 years. Letting go was difficult. Even though I knew I did not want to follow my old path any longer, to let go was to leave behind a large part of myself. When I finally took that leap to my current purpose, I set myself free of my doubts and worries that were holding me back."

The fact is that I love spending time with you but I feel that when I don't go to everything you want me to you put a guilt trip on me.  It doesn't feel good.  Try approaching it in a more positive manner and don't expect me to be into everything you're into.

Just thinking about wiping with folded toilet paper makes me sick. And finally, apparently there are people who wipe while standing up. That's right, they stand up and wipe standing. Your gluteus contracts when you're standing, idiot. I don't even know how they do it, it has to be exponentially harder. These are things homo sapiens figured out 50,000 years ago and you're still doing them wrong. The world is doomed."

Recently, there has been a conflicting battle of thoughts in my head. I'm struggling to find meaning in a meaningless world. I'll be graduating in May and once I begin working, I will be making a cubicle my home. I will spend more time there than anywhere else. But why? I don't know if I'll be happy with that. The other part of me knows that I need to earn money to support myself. I'm trying to be practical. The worst part is that I have no one to talk to about this. I'm largely against seeking help from therapists and I'm not close enough with anyone here. I have friends in my major but without the common theme of work and projects I don't see myself connecting with them at all. I'm not much of a party person and I'm too shy to make friends. But in the end, none of it will matter. I will never see these people again. Then why did I bother getting to know them? Is it because I needed help on problem sets? As I reflect on these past years, I'm left asking myself: why? Why did I go through all this? What was the meaning of all this? I've never connected with anyone here? Will I ever? I did what was necessary to get good grades and graduate but it seems I lost my personality and reason for living somewhere along the way. I'm not suicidal but everything feels so fake and empty."

Being a Joisey Cornellian I can tell you that NJ has the best pizza, best highways in the nation, best utilities and infrastructure, and the best public transit. We also have the cheapest fuel, because NJ does not have a sales tax on gas. I love my job at an oil refinery as a result, because scientists make the most working in this industry and NJ has one of the biggest refineries in the country. We are really the crossroads of the world. It's no wonder why everyone wants to live there and commute to NYC, and house prices reflect that. We are between two great cites Philly and NYC too and in the tri-state area which has a lot of great things to do. California on the other hand is pretty boring I would have to agree I lived there for a few years when my dad was relocated for a project with his company and it sucked. Our business climate is also better with lower taxes and regulations than California's crazy nanny-state policies, like that of reminding people that lead or gasoline is a chemical known to the State of California to cause cancer. The public transportation was lacking compared to the speed and schedules we have over here. In NJ/NYC we have a fast-paced lifestyle which is great because it helps me work to my potential over a slow, boring, relaxed California lifestyle. Boston and DC aren't too far away either and you can take the high speed Acela trains which zoom past the Northeast Corridor catenary and track system on electricity produced by our beautiful Pennsylvania Jersey Maryland electric grid anywhere from 125-150 mph, soon reaching speeds up to 160mph with the catenary upgrades, leaving Caltrain, Metrolink, or any of the California state-subsidized Amtrak services in the dust."

Things made between the late 1920's-50's were made very well when America had a mighty industrial force. The things did not sacrifice material and were made with such redundancy that they last to today. For instance ball bearings (hard to find any made in the USA anymore) were so over engineered that that they last to this day in electrical motors. The Cornell Drinking Water plant used to have massive 3-phase electric motors made in the USA and they lasted from the late 20's when the plant was built until just a few years back when they were replaced with imports. The imports crap out all the time because the bearings in them are crap. What I'm trying to get at is planned obsolesce is rampant in our disposable society. Women are disposable for men are so are things for everyone. We don't buy or build things to last forever anymore. We don't appreciate the little things in life anymore and care more about sex than a long-lasting relationship. Even the buildings built in the Art Deco era have over-engineered steel bridge plate beams most likely from the beautiful Bethlehem Steel plant in Allentown (such as those in Kimball Hall) that are not seen in ""disposable"" buildings that are only meant to least 50 years these days. When they rebuilt the interior of Kimball, they kept the original beams and everything because they were over-engineered and designed so well by American union workers in Pennsylvania. Folks, they don't build anymore like they used to. Our forefathers are amazing people and they built this country to be a great place which is why their buildings are proving to the testament of time."

""Cornell's fucking broke, and I wish the Board and Administration would just admit it. No, we don't have reasonable financial aid, and yes, we're switching to """"need-aware"""" aid for international applicants because Cornell can't afford to help international students. I've worked in different parts of the University and I've seen it firsthand.

What's really frustrating, though, is the fact that Cornell's alumni donate so much money: We're ~ #5 in the world, in terms of alumni donations. Yes, much of that money is earmarked so alumni can stick their names on things before they die. But our Cornell can't manage the endowment, either. 

In fiscal year 2015 Cornell's return-on-investment was 3.5%. It was the lowest in the Ivy League (highest, Princeton, 12.7%, closest, Brown, 5.7%). The median return for other Ivy League schools was 8.4%. 

Cornell has the most students, the most alumni, and some of the best programs in the world in their respective fields. Yet we have the third-smallest endowment, and the worst performing. Even if FY 2015 was an outlier, the fact remains that Cornell can barely make ends meet - We can't even afford chairs for Klarman Hall."""

In my experience a person's attractiveness is inversely proportional to the likelihood they'll respond to your message. Or really their willingness to interact with you or other people in any context. I apologize if this is offensive, but it's been the single best predictor of a person's behavior. The very rare exception is if their attention is asked by someone who is similarly attractive, but that's no guarantee. Similarly, the less attractive a person is, the easier they are to interact with."

Throughout my life, a big part of my identity was aligned with Christianity. Sunday mass, holidays, community service, and Passion Plays made up my youth, and I am grateful for the experiences. But recently, college life has led me astray from my more puritanical upbringing. Several of the clubs I'm in have pushed me towards the party lifestyle and away from prayer and reflection, and my cognitive dissonance (between my sinful life and Christian beliefs) has driven me to suicidal thoughts. Some of my Christian friends have been passive aggressive and judgmental towards me, and I feel more alone than ever."

Life is a constant back and forth of not being good enough and knowing we're all worth it. There are days I think I'm crazy and days I know I'm not. I'm okay with it all. What hurts me about it, though, is that this is the struggle we all face, yet you wouldn't let me help you when you needed it. At the end it was easier to push me away, tell me it was my problems that were too much, and lie to me about wanting to stay involved in my life than tell me your own struggles and let me help you. It was easier to choose those around you who tell you what you want to hear than listen to the one person who tells you what you need to hear. So much for going to the moon and back.

I have a high GPA, I've done relevant research. But I can't get a job. Maybe it's because I don't have internship experience. Do companies offer jobs to people with no internship experience? If I were a MechE, it would be P&G. If I were a BioE, it would be Regeneron. There are many reasons why people didn't do one; perhaps they had a family member to take care of with a terminal illness, perhaps they thought academia was their path. If they didn't even give me a first round interview, I wonder if spending an extra year for a Masters is even worth it. Do people delay graduation on purpose even if they finish all their credits to get an internship? Is there a point in graduating without a job offer?

For once, I did everything right. And Valentine's Day was...well, damn near perfect. For both of us. Yet, for some reason, you insist on remaining friends. Even after all of that gushing, and looking flushed/flustered, and smiling and joking and kissing and groping and carrying, and eating and being and kissing and chilling and seeing, and talking and kissing and snuggling and rubbing and learning and walking and kissing and flirting...you insist. I'll never fully understand you. 

You said it yourself: ""I want you but I refuse to be with you."" Please just explain the disconnect between these two statements.

Is there something I don't know that you don't want to tell me? Is there something you think I've done to you? Is there something you're afraid of? We went from 100% honesty to cryptic, ambiguous messages and we did it so quickly.

I'm fine, like I said I'd be. But I will always want to know. I will always be here to listen. I will always wonder...why?

I don't think I'm suicidal, but I'm definitely depressed. The last time I went to CAPS, I just wanted someone to listen/hear my whole story without judgment, for the most part. But that doesn't seem to be the way things work there. The counselor I was with wanted to do most of the talking, asking questions, and if my responses were too long, she'd cut me off or get visibly impatient.

In my 4 years here I've never had any problems with Gannett, and have always defended them to others. But after my last appointment I really get where the criticism is coming from. 

I got there 15 minutes early in case there were any forms or anything else they wanted me to do before the appointment. The nurse took my weight, height, etc, then told me the doctor would be in shortly, as she was finishing up with another patient. 

Forty minutes went by alone in this room, with no one stopping by to communicate anything, and I began to wonder if I'd been forgotten. So I went out to one of the receptionists to ask how much longer it would be (I'd given myself over an hour for what was supposed to be a 30-minute appointment, but I did have classes afterward), and she became visibly ruffled/upset, as if to say, ""HOW DARE YOU QUESTION US.""

I shrugged off her reaction, because miscommunications happen all the time. But then apparently half the office had been informed that I had dared to ask for more information, because when the doctor finally came in she kept passive-aggressively referencing the situation, and when I went to schedule the follow-up appointment, the staff were awful. 

TL;DR: What the hell, Gannett. I'm sorry I questioned your divine authority and didn't clear my entire freaking day just in case you saw fit to use all of it?"

I have to admit, being a Conservative in Ithaca was hard, but living there provided lots of benefits. I have to say that liberals have some good things going for them. For instance, many liberals are not religious and believe that they need to make the most of life since there is no afterlife. This makes liberal areas quite interesting in terms of food choices and usually where the liberal quotient is high there is usually great food like in Ithaca or Williamsburgh or DUMBO or SOHO or TRIBECA or Hell's Kitchen or Astoria, NYC (Yeah I know ya hipsters spell it Willamsburg, but I come from a different generation of the grimy, old NYC where we spelled it with an h at the end). Even SF is great, with lots of choices of food and also why my favorite talk show host Michael Savage, a staunch conservative lives there and enjoys the Italian cuisine. I love trying new restaurants and really good local liquors, wines, and ales, unlike more conservative places where I am now living in Pennsylvania which suck when it comes to restaurants. Liberals tend to believe they need to enjoy every moment of life for pleasure, food, sex, drugs, alcohol, and entertainment. This is why I conclude liberal music isn't that bad either, and most liberals make far better food and music than conservatives will ever make. But anyways, I can enjoy the best of both worlds and be Conservative and have good food too, knowing that when I die I will reach the Kingdom of Heaven and enjoy even better food than I had on earth. :) P.S. I love Chicken Sag from Sangam or Diamond's. If you HAVEN'T, TRY IT!"

It's just hard to know what your intentions are since you're a fairly shy guy when it comes to this stuff. I used to have the biggest crush on you when we first met, and I think it might be coming back.. I just hope I'm not reading too much into things.

Lately I have been so lonely and have so many problems that I sniff paint thinner I get from Lowe's in small amounts. It is less deleterious on my body that drinking alcohol and it helps me feel better and calm down. I've tried linseed oil and WD-40 with mixed results too. One of my friends was wondering and questioned me about my two cans of paint thinner, WD-40, and linseed oil in my apartment, and I told them that I just use these solvents to clean my art brushes after I finish painting for my class projects. It's not a lie that I use paint thinner to clean my paintbrushes, but it does help get me pretty high when I feel low like I have been for a few months now. The feeling is just so great that's it is irresistible to not sniff because I am stuck in an abyss of loneliness, stress, and endless studio projects that I would otherwise just want to disappear from existence. My art projects have been suffering lately because I have hit a mental block and don't see passion in what I am doing anymore."

""TO #7579

Firstly, I hope you are well and pray that God guides you to truth, I’m going to share my perspective with you on this topic, and I hope you consider this with an open and sincere heart.  So, I’m a Muslim, but wait, don’t let that turn you away.  Please read this through.  God is one, and I’m sure as a Christian you agree.  The belief in the Trinity is a major point of disagreement between Islam and Christianity.  But I just want you to ponder on the idea that every prophet before Jesus the Messiah [peace be upon him] (Adam, Moses, Abraham, Noah, and so on, peace be upon them all) preached that salvation is achieved by worshiping the one, true God as He has taught us through his messengers. It has always been one, simple message, and before Jesus [PBUH], that was enough to earn you heaven.  Sadly, though Jesus’s [PBUH] true message was exactly that, and there are still remnants of it in the Bible (e.g. “”the Father is greater than I” (John 14:28), “The Lord our God is one Lord” (Mark 12:29), “I can do nothing on my own. I judge as God tells me. Therefore, my judgment is just, because I carry out the will of the one who sent me, not my own will” (John 5:30)), the Church (no disrespect) has distorted the message and it has come to the point where God has become three parts.  God is not a God of confusion.  He wants us to have a clear path to worship Him and He will reward us; life isn’t meant to be a trick question because God is more merciful than that.  The Bible calls MANY “God’s sons”, but common sense leads you to understand that it means these are righteous slaves of God, not his literal sons. Somehow, with Jesus(PBUH), people have come to take this literally.  I know this is a lot to take in, but I want to ask you to PLEASE watch the video below of the audio recording of Surah Maryam (the chapter of Mary, Jesus’s (PBUH) mother) in the Quran. The Quran only has one, unchanged version because God promised to preserve it until the end of days, when Jesus (PBUH) will return to defeat the anti-Christ. I hope this will be a starting point for you to learn about Islam, which means “submission” (to God).  I hope you don’t take this offensively or think I am trying to denounce your beliefs.  In the end, God is one, and if you pray for Him to guide you to the straight path with a sincere heart, He will not leave you hanging. “And whoever believes in God - He will guide his heart. And God is Knowing of all things” (Quran 64:11).  I have no vested interest in trying to mislead you. Do what makes sense to you and keep faith in God.

PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE LISTEN TO THIS CHAPTER IN THE QURAN (w/ English subs). I think it will answer some of your questions.

""So moving-in day Freshmen year, I took a bus alone to Cornell to move in. I remember the bus ride being so nerve-racking, I was wondering what life would be like for the next four years and if I would even have any close friends. So once I got to the Ithaca bus terminal downtown, I took a cab to campus. I ended up sharing the cab with some other students returning/moving-in on the way up, and I remember one of them was an older student. I think she could tell I was nervous and that everything looked so new still. I mean to be fair I was gawking at the scenery already. She asked if I was a freshman and some other small talk. 

The thing that really stuck out to me though, was that she made the effort to give me her number and said that I could text her if I ever wanted to hang out or needed someone to talk to. I don't know why but that surprised me so much, she really had no obligation to help out the nervous freshman. It gave me such a great first impression of Cornell. Just wanted to share."""

""So here's the skinny. I was coming in from a good run in the wee hours of the morning and after some cardio, I want to grab some grub before showering and heading out to a 9 AM class (torture, I know). So there I am, minding my own business, looking down at my wonderful, tasteless bowl of corn flakes and milk at some ungodly hour of the morning, and I'm the only person in the dining hall... OR SO I THOUGHT. Some sweet girl walks by, asks me if I want a nice white flower, and murmurs """"yay!"""" when I accept. Very nice gesture, and it definitely brightened up my morning, since someone noticed me for once!

I couldn't just hold onto all that happiness selfishly, and it's a Friday, so I decide """"what the hey"""" and pay it forward. Flash forward to 2 PM in Duffield, and I'm still holding onto said flower after three hours of classes, lunch, and a few more hours of work. I finally work up the courage to pass it on, and decide to pick a table at random. Two very wonderful girls are sitting there, and I tell them an abridged version of this story and ask if they could do me a favor and pass it on. They kind of looked at me a little weirdly (I'm guessing it did sound a bit strange), but smiled and said sure.

When I walked by their table again a few minutes later, I noticed that the flower was gone. I smiled. I'm glad I was able to bring someone else some sense of happiness, even if only ephemeral. However, while I'm happy I was able to give other people some ephemeral sense of happiness, what I really wanted was to give the flower to somebody special. I couldn't work up the courage despite the divine intervention that strangely bestowed the flower upon me that very morning, so here I am, still feeling kind of empty that I don't have the balls to do it. I wonder where that flower is now..."""

I am glad I got out of upstate NY and went to live in Pennsylvania after graduating where I now work. Pennyslvania is a much better state in that taxes are lower and the business regulations are less stringent. The state has been home to many great firsts like the grand and renowned Pennsylvania Railroad which transported people between New York, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., and Harrisburg on it's electrified rail. The system that was build about 100 years ago and electrified in the 1930's is still operating moving people between these major cities in a very efficient manner utilizing energy sources that are high quality and non-intermittent such as coal, natural gas, and nuclear fission. Pennsylvania has a neat energy mix that provides for a low-cost, strong energy grid that is not only capable of supplying electricity to the state, but also to nearby population centers, in New York City, New Jersey, and Maryland under the PJM grid which is tied to the NY state grid. NYS is too reliant on moving towards renewable energy sources such as solar and wind, which at higher quantities could derail the NY energy grid."

""Saturday night November 14, 2014, I went to Pixel with my friends. We were graduating in December and wanted to spend the last few weekends we had together.

Someone took my blue Northface coat that night. That coat was my sister's. At the time she was in the army, and she still is. I had not seen her for a year and a half that November, and it was going to be another year and a half before I would see her again. 
The coat was worn and faded- it had small holes in the elbows and on the cuffs. It had a buckle belt, and a hood with tan fur. There was a pink scarf stuffed in the sleeve and my keys in the pocket. (The scarf was also a gift from a family I used to babysit for, before they moved to a different state). I posted pleas all over Facebook that week asking for the return of the coat and scarf. I received no replies. 

It was a Northface, yes, so maybe I can understand someone wanting to steal it, but it was well worn, faded, and a treasure from a sister that I am not able to see often. The same sister who may be sent to Afghanistan on duty very soon.

When people steal during college, they don't care about the damage that they can do. It's easy to gloss over the fact that there may be meaning behind something as simple as a scarf or a hat or a coat. The walk back home from Pixel that night was very cold, but all I felt was burning anger, frustration and resentment. And I still do. It also angers me more knowing that a good Samaritan would have realized they had taken someone's coat the next morning after a drunk night, and would have tried to return it.

I know it's been over a year since this person stole my coat. I've tried to forget and move on, but the memory still stings bitterly. It may seem like I am overreacting to many, but it is not the material object that I miss. It is the history that the coat has witness, through my sister's personal struggles and my own. I didn't care about the keys - those were easily replaceable. But that coat was absolutely irreplaceable. Knowing that the person who took it most likely left it callously and thoughtlessly in their house, and eventually it may have gone to the Lost and Found to go on to auction or possibly to the Dump and Run sale. In other words, my sister's coat is lost to me forever.

Please, before you steal someone's belongings from one of the bars in Collegetown, please realize what you are doing. Not only are you locking them out of their house that night, but you're leaving a scar as raw and angry and painful as mine still is.

Now I know I could have began ours instead. But instead I fought your love. I fought our future. I am not saying I love you today, because its been too long and that is just creepy. I am just saying, what if I tried harder. What if I could have just been happy with you, knowing that you made me happy, including all of your awkward cuteness. I just keep thinking about how we argued eating dinner at Appel, one minute talking massive shit to one another, and the next holding hands because we that is just how we got along.

""I recently figured out that I am a furry i.e. I like to dress up and role play as various animals with my sex partners with behaviors ranging from anthropomorphic to completely feral. I've never been a part of a group which is viewed as a somewhat controversial minority and, now that I am, I'm much more tolerant and understanding of other people's (consensual) sexual interests or kinks. I was never that judgmental to begin with but what I mean is that I'm no longer surprised to meet people who like to be painted with Nutella, """"kidnapped"""" and pegged by alien dildos, whipped and/or flogged while being humiliated, etc. I guess what surprises me though is that a lot of kink has gone mainstream while the furry fandom still seems to attract a lot of controversy. I wonder if it has something to do with the perceived association with beastiality? If anyone reading this note has that perception, I can at least say anecdotally that I haven't run into any furries who have displayed any interest whatsoever in sexually abusing animals. For me, the excitement of being a furry is in thinking about how to display masterfully your perceptions of an animal's personality i.e. your fursona and stepping outside the stresses and behavioral expectations in the various roles you play in your day-to-day life to have some fun. 

Anyway, there's no astounding conclusion here. I just wanted to put some thoughts out there. I wish there were more people on campus and around town who are furries who want to play. I also hope there will come a time when won't have to hide my sexual preferences and live in fear that someone will recognize me through my costume/make-up and judge me harshly for it. 

I hope everyone has a lovely day and, after reading this, feels a bit more comfortable in their skins (no pun intended) knowing that whatever you like (or even you're asexual!) as long as it's not hurting anyone (unless they have explicitly consented the desire to experience pain) you go ahead and live your life, explore and have lots of fun doing whatever gets you off!

Sometimes I wish I still had my friend at Cornell to talk to because I feel lonely. Not in the sense that I don't have anyone to talk to but because I feel isolated. I cannot sit in one place for too long because I get bored easily, and depressed. I need to move around, explore, see new things constantly. I need to invigorate my hunger for knowledge and learn about the past constantly, especially things of a certain time period in which I love. My friend knows my fetish for this, but we are completely different people and don't see eye to eye. I wish I had a friend who could check things out for me that are what I like in another town/state that I cannot go on vacation to because of work obligations when I'm free. I would need them to act as an agent for me on a reconnaissance for me and obtain pictures of a few things for me, but high quality pictures not the iPhone type. I'm not talking about spying on anybody though. It's different, they just never took pictures of what I asked them to in the first place because they were busy I think. :/ Hopefully one day they could message me again and satisfy my hunger for knowledge."

""Just walked into EARS lobby but it was empty—when I checked, the counseling room was locked. I remembered checking on their website and I was so sure it was still in its regular hours. This was my first time going there so I was unsure what to do. Only a guy sitting there who was apparently doing his homework told me that he hadn't seen anyone there. He said he was sorry. 

I am a very happy and content person but there are simply things I don't understand. I think people are too polite, too afraid to offend, and too eager to please in a tremendously superficial way. I have a lot of friends who are very open to sharing things in their life—everything except their heartfelt desires and shames. This creates an atmosphere in which everyone is both present and absent, both there for you and there to shut you out. I'm not complaining about anything and it's probably my fault, but I just feel this EARS incident represents all things I have experienced in Cornell.

I just think about the Megawatts of electricity being generated at the power plants that burn coal, natural gas, or undergo nuclear fission reactions in Pennsylvania or West Virginia. I love when electrons flow through the copper from Pennsylvania and West Virginia and fucking create a torque on a motor shaft. I hate solar and wind because it does not create an intermittent source of electrons following through the copper or aluminum wires. I also love going to the Hoover Dam and hearing the roar of the massive generators. That's another great intermittent source of power created when our country was great.

I feel like I'm not doing well at college, especially as compared to my friends. Last semester was a disaster for me GPAwise. It wasn't all that bad, but put it together with the bare minimum course load I took, it is pitiful. In terms of outside the classroom activities, I am happy. I got a job, got involved with three clubs, lost elections in one and went to a couple college parties as well. But I'm not doing all that well in my personal life. I am slowly phasing out my friends from back home. I ignored my parents the entire last week. They had to call my roommate. I feel disconnected from the ""friends"" I have here. I should be counting my blessings. It is a huge deal to just be attending a school like Cornell and to avail all the opportunities that come with it, but what use is it if my rubbish grades can't even get me a decent job. I probably shouldn't be worrying about my grades so much, but I came from a background where grades meant everything. I am trying to cope with it all and I know I could seek help with EARS and CAPS, but I feel like doing that would solidify my problem.

The Arts and Sciences administrators, and some departments, probably do need the office space. Humanities students at Cornell are relegated to some of the smallest and oldest buildings at Cornell.

""In response to 7526:

Whoa. Dang. Apologies. I honestly couldn't have anticipated this, nor did I expect it. But I don't like rubbing people the wrong way and I especially don't like coming off as domineering, especially as a man. So to clarify/further elaborate on this apology:

If I sound pretentious, this was not my intent. I don't necessarily think other people have poor taste in art, girls or otherwise. I just have a hard time finding people who appreciate my own. Perhaps this is my fault, and I'm willing to accept that. My tone may have conveyed otherwise.

As for falling asleep, you're only human. If someone falls asleep while I'm watching a movie with them, this isn't going to be a deal-breaker or anything. I suppose I could have rephrased this as: """"I enjoy spending time with people who are willing to stay up late and watch a good film."""" Not so much that the absence of that quality is going to engender some kind of negative judgement from me (you're right, we are all busy Cornell students, although I am too in my defense but that's beside the point.) Rather, I just greatly appreciate the presence of this aforementioned quality. 

As for music. Music is my life. I listen to damn near everything. I'm one of last people you can expect to demean someone over their taste. I'm a wannabee hipster who, admittedly, finds himself generally underwhelmed by most people's tastes (again, girl or otherwise), but that doesn't mean I'm going to start critiquing people. You'd be hard-pressed to present some music that I wouldn't be interested in listening to with you and appreciating on some level.

I think you've interpreted my message as me trying to assert my ideas, tastes, and desires on a woman, which has a lot of really unsettling implications for gender relations and forces me to critically reevaluate myself and how I talk about relationships. So thank you, and please DO continue to live your life and speak out when people like me come around to say foolish things!! I should've thought that one through more. 

The initial purpose of that confession was really just to find people who are passionate about art. I assume that you must be, to some extent. In the spirit of what you've said about validating/supporting others' experiences with art--which by the way is absolutely something I agree with--I'd love to hear your top five songs or films! You could post them in a response to this confession. If you're willing to, of course. If not, no worries.

I see that many of the radical feminists at Cornell attack men for objectifying women and saying that the sexual revolution of the 60's was beneficial. Let me educate you though: The sexual revolution of the 60's did nothing but objectify women because women are ""used"" by men to get instant gratification and they move onto another woman. That's why more young women feel depressed than ever before. In the 1930s-1950's women were put on a pedestal and were respected. Pre-marital sex was very rare and couples waited, instead of seeking instant gratification before they engaged in sexual intercourse. Studies have show this is why marriages have lasted and the divorce rate was very insignificant compared to the high divorce rate of 50% we have today. Plus, women were respected by men. Men protected even women they did not know in public from being attacked and the majority of men learned to NEVER hit a woman unlike today. Plus women did not try to act like men and rough, which was nice. I wish we had more women with a nice, kind sweet voice with a New York accent like Jackie Kennedy. If anything, learn from the past and realize that the sexual revolution has done nothing but encourage the proliferation of single-parent children and STDs. The reason why many feminists cannot comprehend these facts is because they live in a bubble and do not want to face the facts."

When I were a student at Cornell, men and women had respect for one another. We didn't have rapes  occurring in the late 40's and early 50's and the campus was very peaceful. Men returned home after taking their dates back home to meet curfew and couples did not become intimate until after marriage. I am chagrinned by the lack of respect embodied by the students of the millennial generation. Those were the days. I married my wife right after college and lived a happy life until I lost her a few years ago. I know that one day I will be reunited with her back in God's home. I wish I could go back to these peaceful times under Eisenhower again and enjoy those days again with her though. I am remorseful for the fact that many students will never be able to see the ""Happy Days"" version of Cornell. I know I will see my wife soon enough and we will enjoy the happy days again, though."

100 Jobs, that's nothing! I've applied to over 300 and I'm still sitting at home like a leech sucking my parents dry because no one wants to hire me. I'm so desperate, more than you, that I'm considering being a prostitute because I no longer have the dignity to have to live off of someone especially after finishing an Ivy League school like Cornell. My parents never went to college and own a successful business, own a house, and were able to do it in their early 20's. I really suck and I guess sometimes you have to do what you have to do to earn money. I feel so ashamed of myself when my family sees me for the piece of crap that I am. I think Cornell is lousy too because it often seems that everyone here has a job, yet there are many people who do not find a job and never make it into the stats because they never fill out the survey they are sent after graduation because they are sick of the school."""

I always question if what I'm doing is right or wrong.  Sometimes I'm stricken with a fear that I'm an awful person.  It's all just a manifestation of things that have been said to me by people I think I love.  Nah, I really do love them, but they torture me.  Such is love, I suppose.

I had a decent grasp on the material in Chem 2070 - I got 90s and 100s on the lab reports and I got the majority of questions on the problem sets correct. Yet I scored below the average for both prelims, though I got within the standard deviations. I ended with a C in Chem, as well as a C in calc, As in sociology and my FWS, and a 2.7 GPA. As a pre-med student, I am extremely worried that I won't be accepted into medical school with grades like this. Yes, it's only my first semester ever at Cornell, but doesn't this predict how I will do in following semesters? Can someone offer me some advice?

Liberals throw science out the window when they claim that Caitlyn Jenner is a woman. He has Y chromosomes and is therefore a man, plain and simple. Just because he has a mental illness that compelled him to mutilate his genitals doesn't change the undeniable fact that he is indeed a man. For every other mental illness, we treat the victim. If someone has dyslexia, we never contend that the words that he/she sees are somehow the problem; we recognize that we must treat the person's condition so that he/she is able to see words normally. When it comes to gender identity disorder, we accept the disorder and modify the human's gender (although genetically the person's sex remains the same) in order to treat the disorder, which is completely absurd."

""Anyone who favors assault rifle/shotgun bans over pistol bans is racist. Plain and simple. According to the FBI, 510 gun deaths in the year 2014 were caused by rifles and shotguns; 5562 deaths were caused by handguns in that same year. In other words, you are more than 10 times as likely to be killed by a pistol than to be murdered by weapons dubbed as “mass killing machines.” Now let’s break-down who exactly is murdered by each weapon type. 

Black poor people are the most common group to be killed by handguns. Here’s why: There is a strong positive correlation between poverty and gun violence. Moreover, black people, of any racial group, have the greatest chance of being poor and living in inner city areas prone to crime. Statistics back this up: black people comprise half of gun deaths. Finally, what weapon to poor people, often black, use? A pistol, because that’s the easiest and cheapest weapon to obtain; acquiring an assault rifle is a significantly more arduous process. 

Now for people killed by assault rifles and shotguns: these are usually in mass shootings in which white people living in affluent areas are killed. Take, for example, the Sandy Hook shootings, in which scores of white children were murdered. Really, for most mass shootings, the perpetrator, who will go to whatever lengths to obtain an assault rifle, unleashes absolute hell on as many people, most commonly in suburban areas (where the victims are usually white). 

Let’s compare the two categories: the first category consists of more people being killed by handguns who happen to be mostly black and poor. The second category consists of far fewer people being killed by assault rifles and shotguns who are mostly wealthier and happen to be white. Therefore, demands that assault rifles be banned implicate the message that the lives of 5 black people killed in inner city violence are worth less than the lives of 5 white people killed at an Oregon college. This is the true meaning of hypocrisy on the Left for touting that “Black Lives Matter” while favoring gun reform that safeguards white lives more so than black lives. 

If the Left’s actual agenda was to reduce gun violence, they would advocate for either limiting the amount of guns (all types) in the U.S. and/or restoring law and order to impoverished areas. If you eliminate all guns, you can presumably, as the Left likes to believe, significantly reduce gun violence. And if you improve the poverty situation plaguing our cities, there will be fewer firearm homicides in those areas. But to favor assault rifle/shotgun bans over handgun bans is bigoted and does little to help America’s supposed “gun epidemic.”"""

You know how sometimes you feel like you are trapped in a cobweb, or a room with glass walls? Like, you can try your hardest (well, think that you are anyway), tell yourself every day that you need to get out, and you need to figure out the damage that you have done to yourself, and that you need to change and you need to be a better, more responsible person, a person who embraces their accountability to themselves, and their family and their friends and the world around them? Do you know that feeling where you are watching your life go by like watching a terrible spectator sport or reality show? A feeling where you have no sense of control, where you are observing your life rather than living it, where you deal with situations passively rather than proactively? Do you understand what it feels like to not have a tangible list of goals or internal desires, and instead set arbitrary goals based on conventional ideas of success and fulfillment, because even being bored but rich is better than being bored and poor? Do you understand the irony of living life without having an all-consuming passion for something? You know you are average, perhaps even above average, but you know that even if you lie between the 70th and 80th percentile of human beings in the world, based on success as defined by both conventional lifestyles and new age philosophies, you are mediocre. You are OK among the OK. Do you feel scared to live certain days with the realization that you are hollow on the inside, with no discernable personality traits? You put up a brave face and you tell people you know who you are, almost flippantly, with an air of nonchalance, when on the inside, you are breaking into a nervous sweat, terrified of being called out for who you truly are, a shadow human, an empty vessel, a piece of gum that clings on to person’s boot and travels with them. Do you know that you are lying to yourself every day when you say that eventually, when the time comes, you will wake up one morning with zeal and vigor and start achieving your destiny with furious intensity, but you know this is a lie because you have no destiny because you are literally no one? How does one describe you? Who are you? What are you? What defines you? You probably don’t know the answers to these questions either, because if you did, you wouldn’t be reading this. 

Probably the shittiest part of this shitty shitfest is the fact that knowing this doesn’t change anything. It is like being awake while under anesthetic: You are aware and attuned and can feel every painful moment on your skin but are unable to do anything about it. It’s like watching yourself cut yourself every day, tiny little cuts just breaking the surface of the skin, oozing out bright red blood and leaving a thin white scar that is visible only to you, mocking you for your complete lack of power. You feel emasculated, held captive by your own shitty personality (or lack thereof) that cuts off your balls and leaves you like a withered cloth, to be tossed around by the wind.

Sometimes I wish I would just die. Not kill myself, because that would be an active decision, but just die. Quick, easy and painless. After all what is the point of being alive if you have nothing of value to contribute to the world around you. It would be such a relief to binge watch a TV show, binge eat Cheetos and binge drink whiskey and pass out and never, ever wake up. Because, I don’t know about you, but I am tired of doing nothing and being nobody. All my life, all I wanted to be, was to be unconventional and unintentionally admirable. Yes, I scoff at the idea of being and being around traditional role models but I have always wanted to be a Kurt Cobain: someone who lives by his own rules, defines his own morality, dies too young and inspires a whole generation of kids to come, reaching almost mythic stature posthumously. But I am neither unconventional nor admirable, just an empty shell.

What would you do, if you were me? No seriously! Because I am approaching the brink of desperation. Good advice, self-motivating talk, writing things down; nothing helps. I feel like I am beyond the point of no return and I am just standing at the edge and grinding my feet into the cliff side and hoping that the next strong gust of wind (getting fired ha ha) will not push me right off into the abyss. How do I simplify my life? Why am I so in the middle with regards to everything? I wanted to be unconventional but I failed at that, however now I am at failing at being a conventionally successful human being as well. I am envious of the very people I mocked in my teenage years: computer engineers, MBA’s, suits in corporate jobs. They may be cogs of a big fucked up machine that crushes the poor and the middle class but at least they can afford a nice apartment, and take vacations, and get promoted?  They may not be Pulitzer Prize winners but neither am I going to be one if I am twenty five years old and still unpublished! They may not be Grammy nominees or performing at MSG or Radio City or even the Village Vanguard but at least they learned how to play that fucking guitar they bought and have fun strumming along to pop songs? Do you think sometimes your snobbery, be it with respect to popular media, music, editorials, food or even shopping, is just a veneer to hide behind: To mask the absence of a personality with contempt for conventionally happy or “basic” personalities? 

As every day goes by, I am starting to feel that I am trapping myself further and further and deeper and deeper into the grave I started digging for myself. Soon, no one can reach me to pull me out because I will be in too deep. There is only a point up to which people can help, beyond which the initiative, the drive and the courage to change must come from within. But when you feel like you are unable to get a foothold then you can’t climb up, even to reach out to people who are standing by the edge just ready to help. Or maybe all of this reasoning, all this pondering about maybe you suffer from depression, that maybe insomnia could be the cause not the symptom of said depression, maybe you have repressed issues that are manifesting in the form of anxiety, depression, lethargy  and procrastination is just your shield to hide away from the terrible truth: that you are making up all these problems to search for an excuse to justify what a shitty human being you are, that you don’t work hard because you are incapable of dealing with struggle and failure and too lazy to push yourself, that you are incapable of learning and growing, have no marketable skills and just generally a waste of space on this planet. Now what? What do you do if this true? It is so easy and convenient to blame something or someone for your failures than to accept that you are the problem, not the subject facing the problems, because where does one go from there? 

I wish I had the courage to do something. Mostly I wish I had the courage to kill myself and make it look like an accident so that my mom and dad will get the insurance money and be less burdened by debt than they are now, debt brought upon them by me, for my stupid “education” and stupid “career” that is going nowhere, for my lack of responsibility, for giving me a shot at a life I don’t deserve and will never live because I just don’t strive hard enough. If not die, I wish I had the courage to quit this job, go back to India, become a nomad and try to write my book, but we all know that is not happening. OK, I wish I had the fortitude to go home and practice coding and learn things on Coursera and study and write the Java OCA exam and become a certified coder, but NO, because I can’t function as human being if I am not numbing my mind with TV or alcohol. All I do, is wallow in self-pity, until I feel a hint of self-satisfaction and it is back to Netflix and junk food and booze till I black out. And so the cycle repeats.

I give up.  I just fucking give up. Period. Because I don’t know what to do anymore."

Median grades on our transcript is the worst thing cornell can do to us for graduate school, medical school, law school, etc. If the class has a high average  then that makes us look bad if we get a bad grade (or even a good grade). If the class has a low average, the graduate schools will realize it is a hard class, but still take the person from Harvard with straight A's and a higher GPA. Every other ivy league doesn't do this to their students, but Cornell is determined to try to prove how hard the classes are to everyone else. It might help Cornell's reputation, but it hurts the students."

I think most people at an Ivy League institution believe that they have to be a perfect (most productive, highly achieving, emotionally stable, most likeable) person by the time of graduation.

As someone who just graduated and is exposed to ""adults"", I can tell you one things: while those efforts one makes in college are useful, everyone must start from 0 when they graduate, as life becomes very different. In fact, I think one can never ever be a perfect person permanently in one's life: one can be the best version of him/herself in one period of one's life, but as life changes, one must also be able to adapt to that change and restart, many times becoming the person one thought one would never become.

The most we can do is to learn to be adaptive and patient during life's biggest obstacles. and if there's one thing that we should all take from our Cornell education is the ability to learn and reflect, not only for professional purposes, but also for our personal journeys in life. I've observed that many people who always strive for perfection often forget to remember that incredible lesson."

The tipping culture in the US is strange and unfair. It was one of my first WTF moments when I moved here, along with cars are essential appliances (but I won't go there). In Europe, you generally round up, and that's the tip. If the bill is $24.50, you leave $25. Here anything under 15% is rude. That's a lot of money. I'm not saying the people don't deserve it, but there are a lot of minimum wage jobs where people deserve extra for their effort and don't get it. It seems very arbitrary to give money to waiters, taxi drivers and barbers for doing their job. I'd rather tip the child who made my phone, or a busy retail worker who has 10 people asking them questions, and yet finds time to deal with my problem, or a customer service rep on the phone who's particularly helpful, or people who work at self-service restaurants -- they also clean tables and prepare my food. Table service restaurants actually lose my business most of the time, because I am essentially taxed an extra 15% for eating there so I just go elsewhere. I wish this culture would end. Waiters are not underpaid, they actually make a lot more than the average minimum wage worker for essentially the same job, because of tips. Takeout is especially egregious -- I'm supposed to leave some guy $5.50 for driving 4 blocks to my building, and taking an elevator? I call BS on tips."

I feel like there's a huge amount of frustration, unhappiness and resulting lost productivity from people being sexually frustrated because they can't find anyone to date, be in a relationship, or just have sex with. A NYT article I just read said 45% of people in their 20s have not had sex in the past year. I think social media, and everything happening online nowadays have made the issue a lot worse. And so have computers in general -- people spend half their lives in front of monitors, that's highly unnatural and depressing.

And the social contract is pretty strict on talking to strangers, save for just the right circumstances/environment. Even at networking events and other places where you're expected to mingle, people stick in their groups and don't really talk to strangers, let alone try to start a romantic thing. You can go to bars and clubs, but that's not really how a lot of people want to meet, and despite having the reputation for being places to pick up strangers, it's basically just as hard. The internet has capitalized on this (ironically since it contributed enormously to the problem) with dating apps and sites, but I personally have a psychological block and don't take people I ""meet"" on those apps, like Tinder, to be ""real"" people. It's almost like playing a video game. It's not organic, it's not normal and the ""stranger on the internet"" image basically makes it very hard to commit and take it seriously.

I'm not proposing a solution, I just think it's sad that there are millions upon millions of lonely and/or horny people who see each other outside all the time, and like each other, but can't do anything about it. I've had multiple instances where I felt someone liked me, and I liked them too, but we just didn't have the right excuse to start a conversation. That leads to frustration because that's not how we evolved. I'm not suggesting we go back to how we evolved, because that's essentially rape, but I feel like the species does best when we can emulate, within reasonable ethical boundaries, the processes that helped us evolve. This is why capitalism works and communism does't -- people are competitive and greedy by nature. I think we need to figure out a way to apply the same principle to meeting people of the opposite sex."""

I am an alumnus that is sick and tired of my job in the city. Cornell didn't give me shit. I paid full price for the school and had to earn everything on my own. Whenever I come home I pour myself a few Peechka Vodka shots or Jack Daniel's Mint Juleps and listen to Cyndi Lauper, Rod Stewart, The Cure, Madonna, Thompson Twins, The Police, Billy Joel, and Sting. I miss the 1980's when my favorite President was running the country and the stock market and economy was doing great.  I had a way better job than I have today. In the late 2000's the company I used to work for closed and I got a shitty job before I retire. In the 80's businesses and the middle class expanded rapidly. I had money to drive a nice Mustang, sport a nice Coach leather briefcase that was made in the USA unlike today's imported crap, dress in Brooks Brothers suits, sport coats, ties, and dress shirts that were Made in NYC, and own a nice house in the suburbs along with a vacation home in Florida. I miss my old lifestyle. I hope one day it can come true again and I will be off really well driving a Corvette at 90mph and swerving the curves on the Palisades Parkway, this time listening to Madonna on full blast again."

I love this beautiful country. I love the military, the police, the church, and the ROTC program at Cornell. Cornell was founded by a conservative who loved America named Ezra Cornell. He was a farmer and a very smart businessman who developed a way to trench telegraph cables under the ground and created Western Union, a beautiful corporation. This was the predecessor to our telephone system. Bernie Sanders would try to undermine capitalism and destroy the beautiful institutions such as McDonald's and Walmart, which have provided jobs to many and made this country great. I cannot wait for this country to become more patriotic and so that we could become the best country in the world. We can build a wall to protect our integrity and manufacture most of our goods in the USA with regard to quality. I love this country so much that I have several flags flying in my front yard and I always buy everything that is Made in the good ol' USA because it will make my beautiful country even greater. We cannot afford to be sending anymore money overseas to countries that are dangerous and building up their militaries agains the United States."

""Today I calculated the probability of an undergrad finding true love at Cornell.

Here’s how it goes.
Undergraduate population: 14,393
Gender: Percentage of the preferred gender (if you’re bisexual, lucky you, your chances are twice as high):  about 50% (it’s 49% for males and 51% for females)
Age: Percentage within a two-year age range (ex as a freshman, I counted freshmen, sophomores, and juniors): 75%
I'm about to assume that beauty and compatibility are qualities that are normally distributed in the Cornell population.
Beauty: Who I find more than a standard deviation above average physical attractiveness: 31.8%
Compatibility: Who I find more than two standard deviation above average for personality and other characteristics (kindness, intelligence, etc): 2.2%

Total is 0.26% of the undergraduate population, so 38 people. This is the pool of people that I would be interested in dating.

However, they would have to reciprocate my feelings.

Beauty: My premise here is that beauty is subjective and in the eye of the beholder. Assuming that I’m averagely attractive, some people will think that I'm ugly and others will think I'm gorgeous. Percentage who find me more beautiful than a standard deviation above average: 31.8%

Compatibility: This part is pure conjecture (as if the rest hasn’t been). I think that if Person A finds Person B compatible, then it’s more likely that Person B will find Person A compatible. I’m compensating for this by making Person B’s threshold for compatibility 1 standard deviation above the mean (instead of 2): 31.8%

This yields a pool of 0.027% of the population, or 4 people, in whom I’d be interested and who would also be interested in me. These are the “true love” potentials.

I estimate that I meet an average of 10 new people per week. If you’re particularly outgoing or like to keep to yourself, then you might want to adjust that number accordingly. With about 25 weeks at school per year, I’d meet 250 new people each year. This yields a 6.6% chance meeting one of them in the next year.

That’s really not bad. And here’s more fun with probability: if 20 people read this, then the chance that at least one of them meets one of their matches this year is 75%. 1 - (chance of no meetings) = 1 - (1-0.066)^20 = 0.75.

Credits to this article for the idea: http://en.nothingisreal.com/wiki/Why_I_Will_Never_Have_a_Girlfriend

If you really like what I just did here and think we have a shot at true love, then feel free to comment! But don’t get your hopes up. The chance that you’re one of my 4 matches is only 0.027%. ;)"""

We have gotten to the point where North Korea has created a hydrogen bomb and blasted it. I am afraid they may have the power to attack us soon. :( Our president does nothing to stop it because the North Korea views him as a weak leader whom they are not afraid of. Reagan knocked down walls including the Berlin Wall and lead to the eventual collapse of communism in the Soviet Union. We need a strong leader because our country is in serious trouble. We don't win anymore. We lose to everybody at trade and at the border. Other countries are taking away our jobs. I cannot believe that most of my Cornell peers are so liberal they support our current president and cannot find fault in anything he does even though he has practically decimated our beautiful country. I hope that they could support a candidate who tells it like it is and is not afraid for us to have a strong military so that we can defeat North Korea just by showing our strength."

There's no hope for me in this world.  If the greater world around me knew what my life has been, is like, and will be, I would expect to see nothing less than tears and horror on faces besides my own.  Why do people say that ""everything heals with time""?  Shouldn't the saying go, ""everything heals with time if you're lucky""?  Or ""everything heals with time*  *only for a select few""?  Because the things you've seen when you were young, when you were growing, and even now--these things stay with you forever, whether it be in the form of flashbacks, emotions, or an altered brain.  It's never enough for people to just accept that not everything heals with time for everyone; why are people so naively optimistic, especially the ones who haven't been through much or have been lucky in healing?  News flash:  The world doesn't work in everyone's favor.  I'm sick of dealing with everything.  I despise society and the cruel, strict way it runs.  I hate the concept of family.  I'm sick of hearing everyone make their life struggles a) exaggerated and b) a competition, especially when they have experienced nearly nothing (sorry. but not actually).  I'm tired of being unable to fall asleep until 4 AM because some memories or thoughts have kept me past the point of sleeping.  I'm so exhausted wondering what the cops will think of my body when they find me dead and empty-eyed someday.  If they carry my body, will they make a side comment, ""certainly not skinny""?  I'm so sick of being labeled the outcast, when really, this is what everything has made me and it's so normal.  I'm just a tired soul."

I came to Cornell thinking straight about what I'd do, but instead, my courses were nothing like what I wanted to do. My GPA sucked and I barely managed to graduate. I made a mistake, I should have switched majors, but couldn't. 

In April, I lost the love of my life, because she lost feelings for me. Like having professional problems wasn't enough, my personal life also got fucked. Am a firm believer in falling in love once, and growing old with that person till death do us part. But clearly, it's too easy to lose feelings these days I guess. I guess having best friends who lost feelings for their better halves rubbed on to my love too. I still talk to my love and cry to sleep daily. God I wish I could just be there or turn back time, I'd have never left their side.

After a terrible GPA, being international and brown just added to my problems because only """"privileged"""" people born here or citizens of this country have it easy. Also, I am not in software or electronics, so west coast was out. I struggled to find a job. When I did, I started working and currently, I hate my mentor and I hate the job. I am a fucking engineer, born to make things, but being an international student, trying to keep my job, visa status and all that jazz, I am curbing my talent as an engineer. So much for this country being the land of opportunities. More like land of opportunities for those who came years back or are privileged to be citizens. For people like me, who made a mistake, who have talents that go way beyond my resume and soft skills, this country is really shallow. I need to have a """"network"""". I need to be a smooth talker. Bloody hell, sponsorship for visa is a fucking criteria to get a rejection from a company that needs people like me. 

When did a country made from immigrants, that created such technological advances with the help of immigrants, become so xenophobic? Why are international students don't given the same freedom to do what their passion is instead of sticking to a god damn degree? 

I wish this year changes things for the better. I hope I am able to move on or get back with my ex who I love dearly. If it wasn't for my friends around, I'd have broken beyond repair. Luckily, they keep me occupied with crap which makes me feel better. I love you guys, way too much :*"

All these posts about """"Nobody here knows me"""" make me feel bad. Is society at the point where people are presumptuous enough to think that in 4 years they can get to know someone perfectly? The human mind has such depth and complexity that I wouldn't even dare claim to know some of my better friends here. Life is a struggle and it sculpts us bit by bit: we are born granite and experience chips away at us until some semblance of a person is made. 
     I have learned in my time here to not follow the crowd, to not base my assumptions on externalities or single instances of actions, to not judge someone based on their political beliefs (we are still children), to think before I act, and to see money for what it really is: a piece of paper. Yes money is our livelihood and I don't believe in the """"do whatever you want in college"""" bullshit (unless you have the financial means) but money is secondary in our search for meaning."

Not working is so much better than working. You have so much more time. I don't feel fulfilled by work and I don't feel like I have a life because I have a job. I have no time for anything but work, eat, sleep. The world offers so much and I can't do any of it now. But then that stuff costs money and I can't get the money unless I work.

""Last semester was absolutely horrible. I feel that the only way to move on is to forget everything. I don't know how long this method that will last, because I feel like I might slip back into that state again. I think part of the problem is because I do not have much of a social life. I act very strangely and immaturely around people. I need to do something about it, because it is getting worse and worse. I am thinking about rushing, which I should have done last year, but I am scared I might not get in, because I am not outgoing and I look hideous :(. I don't even have enough cute things to wear for rush. Greek life is so financially expensive, but also so socially worth it, so I am very conflicted. I don't want to join band, although you people sound really nice. I really should get a job or join a team, but I feel like I am not qualified enough, and I don't have the motivation for applications and interviews and rejection.

Quite frankly, I think more products should be Made in the USA. Whenever you walk into the store you see low quality crap imported from elsewhere. There are so many countries that are taking away our jobs here in the USA and lot's of people come out of universities including from Cornell like I just did and can't find a job as a result. I would rather be a manufacturing worker and get good pay and benefits like a great life insurance policy, health care, and a pension plan than work at a fast food joint. Seriously, I had an great GPA (3.82 in Physics) from Cornell and the only job I could find was part time with no benefits at a pizza place. I feel like a worthless loser. :/  :(  It feels like sometimes I wasted my time going to Cornell to get a job that I could have after high school without wasting my parent's money. My parents never went to college and have been more successful than I have since they were able to buy a nice house and own a large business a few years out of high school and no they did not inherit shit from my grandparents. They earned it on their own during the 1980's, a time that was much better economically because of some great economic policies that allowed the middle class to expand and corporations to create more jobs. I think the American Dream is DEAD now, but I am hopeful that soon it will be back BIGGER and BETTER than ever before. I am a Christian and I pray and hope that God will help me find a job perhaps at the end of this year or maybe next year. I had to get this out, since I have been frustrated for the past few months....."

I hate being poor. There's the stigma others put on us of being poor, like we/our parents aren't as hard working or like it's somehow our fault. There's also the constant judgement my parents cast on me whenever I make any independent financial decision. ""Why did you spend $1.50 on water? You could have saved it up. Or if you were determined like us, you could have waited til you got home to drink from the tap."" Even when I got a job on campus, they still shame me for spending anything that wasn't absolutely (and I mean absolutely) necessary. When I ran out of BRBs last semester, I would skip breakfast and lunch and just use my dining hall meal swipes for dinner. Yes I have money in my debit card, but I can't bring myself to spend money. There's an extreme sense of discomfort whenever I pull out my debit card. I feel disappointed in myself for not being as frugal as my parents, and I feel ashamed of myself whenever I occasionally buy coffee at the cafes on campus. When I'm conscious of the fact that I'm poor and that I inevitably have to spend money on something, I criticize myself for being weak-minded and frivolous. And maybe I deserve to be poor if I can't be financially strong-willed. All I know is that I'm going to work ridiculously hard and land a good job and never have to worry about money for me or my parents ever again. Because being poor absolutely SUCKS."

I'm too young to be this cynical about life but I can't help it. I don't believe in love or anything. I mean my mother has had two failed marriages and its hard for me to want a relationship after seeing what she's been through. It doesn't seem worth it. I'm committed to the grind right now. But the thing is I don't know if that is enough. Working hard, going to the best schools, getting the best internships is hard work and it takes a lot out of you. I just don't know if it's worth it. I'm not some genius like my family likes to think I am. I have to work hard because a majority of the kids here are smarter than me. And sometimes its not enough. I had a rough start at Cornell. My first semester gpa was a 2.6 in engineering. I worked through that. Countless late nights reading and doing practice problems. Staying in on the weekends and studying. I'm a senior now and I've brought my gpa up quite a bit but not where I want it to be. My personal standards are high and I fall short almost every time. I've applied to over 60 jobs and have had only a few interviews. Maybe I'm entitled. But is wanting reward for hard work being entitled? I don't know. I also have never had a close friend because I find it hard to trust people. So, I don't think I expect much out of my life. Definitely cynical."

To the idiots who are putting graffiti on campus (excluding the frat house), throwing hammers and sickles on historic statues and buildings is not going to do jack sh*t for your cause, if that is the point. The administration may see it as they spend thousands of YOUR dollars to clean it, but they are not going to listen. If you are protest groups, then protest! If you are stupid teens, take your angst elsewhere. Why are you doing this? Why? But on the subject of the frat house, I am a victim of sexual assault so I can understand that pain. I would have loved to tag my attackers house, after no one listened to me. But I didn't, instead I got up the courage to go to a support group that  helped me get some of my life back. I don't know if graffiti will help them listen to that struggle either."

There was a post below about receiving your exams after taking them and there was a comment about why test taking and getting your test back are not mutually exclusive. I just wanted to say that I still think thats bullshit. When I take a test and I see something I don't kniw I want to learn how to do it. I took a semester long class to learn this shit and if I'm not being told how to do it afterwords I feel two things: one is that it makes me feel like nobody cares about my learning -- I want to be able to leave a class saying I knew how to do most of whats on the final. It also makes me feel like comparing the schools is more important than individual education, and if thats the case then please let me pack my stuff and go to another school. Instead of focusing on whether you're teaching the same thing or about standards an whatnot, I think much would come out of the administration making sure the students are actually learning. This semester I was only asked whether certain professors deserved teaching awards and not asked what they could do to improve. Not only does that put a positive bias on professors but it doesn't allow students to voice the very present dissatisfaction with certain professors."

A lot of people paint romanticized visions of college as the one time where you can truly pursue your interests and explore who you are and whatnot, but I feel like I have to instead treat college like some boot camp for the workforce. And it's very frustrating."

So guess what, undergrads. Listen up carefully. I graduated in May of 2015, with a 3.90 gpa in Biology. Worked my ass off. And right now I'm not exactly where I thought I'd be in my life. I'm in a tech position that doesn't appreciate my smarts at all or utilize my skills, that I thought would help me get somewhere, but hasn't, and it's been made clear recently to me by the incredibly ""emotionally fluctuating"" PI that it won't. I can't even read the shit on this page, or the yikyak at cornell or anything anymore. I hate to pull this...but none of you understand what it's like after graduation. Getting those grades? Freaking out and stressing so much about them? Isn't going to make an ounce of difference. You're going to graduate. Whoop de f*cking do. And then you're going to get thrown into the real world. And if you were an introvert like me in college, at least professor-wise, you're not going to be able to land shit. I didn't network, and now I'm not utilizing my skills, and i'm making $15 an hour. My advice? Stop worrying so much about your goddamn grades and start making sure professors like you, like you enough to help you get where you want to go. Don't end up where I am. Don't end up like this. Ivy league doesn't mean anything if you don't have connections. You've been warned."

She recently notified me that all her friends and family think I'm selfish, foolish, and entitled (as if that should mean the world to me and convince me to discard my set of values and replace it with hers...she actually believes that their opinions justify her disdain for me when all they've ever heard about me are her tirades). My father seems to support me but I keep forgetting that he only voices his support as a way of spoiling me, or at least that's how he sees it. Anytime I voice an opinion that's different from his own, he becomes a defensive, angry monster--""You're just a little girl! You know nothing! You just need to accept that I know more than you! Im not disrespecting my newly devout Hindu friend by sneaking beef into his food and then laughing about it when he spits it out!

I can't believe my professors are allowed to hold on to tests (after we are allowed to glance at our grade). The only possible reason a professor wouldn't allow students to keep tests is that he or she reuses the exam. I's lazy, disrespectful (you can't even be bothered to do a key part of your job?), encourages cheating, and hurts students. The purpose of an exam is to allow students to demonstrate what they know, and to help in assigning grades. Practical feedback on what students do and do not know or understand is crucial when huge percentages of our final grades (60,70,80+) is on the line. I've had to go into finals blind, without being able to study any of my prelims and without a single piece of feedback. Your job is to teach. Don't hurt our education, our grades and our futures."

Unfortunately, I know that it can only get harder from here on out. 
Cornell's community is amazing and supportive, but it is hard at times to stay positive when the light at the end of the tunnel is nowhere in sight.
Keeping your head up despite the struggle is sometimes the only thing you can do, and to this end I would like to offer you a few simple pieces of advice to carry you into 2016.  
Use those around you for inspiration.
Plan each week in advance. 
Everyone has something they can teach you.
Never be afraid to ask for help when you need it. 
Never quit on your friends.

My professors at Cornell always pushed CFL and LED lightbulbs as being great because they ""save the environment."" I am so glad I graduated Cornell this semester. Now that I moved back home, I replaced all the lightbulbs in my house to incandescents. No government-media complex will tell me what lightbulbs I can have in my house. I will use incandescents and buy as many as I can before the government bans them because they quality of light is better with incandescents and is more natural. I don't care if my house uses more Pennsylvania coal for electricity...it's negligible in the long run anyways since our impact on the planet is not even noticeable.

With rush coming up I'm so nervous about what it's like joining a sorority. There seem to be a lot of resources and information available for guys for recruitment, but not much for girls. My guy friend went to a greek info session on whats its like to be LGBT and greek, but it was only focused on frats. Will my possible sisters accept me for who I am? I'm scared if I go greek I'll just have to go back into the closet."

I've always thought myself too cynical and insecure about romance to be in a relationship. This one boy in particular managed to come under my skin and to, what I thought, take all of me when he left. I was tired; I was sick of love. And yet in the moments in which I was most repelled by love did I realize I needed it the most. Love is a right that you always need to give yourself, no exceptions. And once I built myself back up did I realize that he did not take all of me; my courage made me infinite. I am now in a wonderful relationship with a boy that I like very much. He supports me and encourages me to continue to love as much as any one can. Blessed."

""My ex and I broke up over several. So I should have completely moved on by now, am I right? Particularly considering that I haven't spoken to him properly in over a year. Then why am I a pathetic loser that still gets affected by what he does?
Last Christmas, my best friend told me that this particular ex has been hitting on her for quite a while, saying things to her that he probably never said to me. It hurt. It hurt like a motherfucking sonofabitch. But I internalized the anger as much as I could, and tried not to hate my friend and channel my rage only towards my ex. I ended up sleeping with a guy my bestie had a crush on, over New Year's. And a week later, she met my ex over drinks. I embraced the possibility of something happening there. I probably deserved it as well. Again, it hurt but I pretended like I didn't care and got through this year. Gradually, I fell back in my old pattern of blaming myself for the break-up and wondering if I could have done something to fix it.
This year, my bestie is back to visit me over New Year's and she brought up the ex again in conversation. It seems that my worst fears were true. They did kiss, but that's all, she said. He has been constantly dogging her for sex over the year: sending unsolicited dick pics, asking for nudes, video sex and all that stuff that she is not even comfortable with. The thing that was the worst was that he sent her a dick pic while she was in my house, with me, and told her that it would be so much fun to see how I would react if I saw that he was sending her nudes. While this grossed her out too, I think something in me broke.
I thought I was over him last year. But the loneliness of grad school, and being in your mid twenties and not knowing what one wants out of life, can become a black hole of self pity and depression. So I kept thinking that I could have done something to fix things and have him back. But, I think that I have never hated someone as much as I have hated him in my life. I hate him. And I think I hate living."""

What exactly is an ""old soul?"" Why does everyone say it? I like to have sex and I""m sexually active. Does that mean I'm not an old soul? Wait! But I like to netflix and actually chill too! And I like discussing philosophical theories and politics. I usually prefer reading over partying. No? Still not an old soul?

I can't help think that people who call themselves old souls as pious. That they think they are somewhat better than those who frequently hook up. The truth is, we're all just trying to figure out what we truly want. Some people just want more sex. But they could also want intimacy. The term ""old soul"" creates an ""us vs them"" attitude when in reality, people more or less want the same things. It's not that you're either into hook up culture or you're an old soul. So can we stop distinguishing the two?"

I am a premed who graduated from Cornell with honors in 3.5 years and I have a 3.875 GPA. I also struggle with depression and paranoia. I constantly feel that I am inadequate and worry about failure. Also, no one in my family cares about my professional aspirations and they are constantly nagging me to snatch up a husband from Cornell because they believe that marriage soon after college is the ideal path for a young woman. I tried very hard to secure a boyfriend for the past 3.5 years but I had trouble maintaining all my long term boy relationships. I am worried that something is inherently wrong with my character, perhaps I should be more passive, more compromising, more loving. Perhaps I should smile more, dress up better, and voice less of my opinions. Many of my family friends are professional women in their 30s and cannot get married, so I am worried that this might happen to me. I am really scared."

Today, I realized how screwed up gender dynamics in this world are. I've hardly ever talked about the times when I've felt terrified simply crossing a street because of some creep following me, because I've always felt some sort of shame, as if it's my fault that I'm being looked at in this way, like I'm property for sale. Compliments like ""you have a beautiful smile"" should feel pleasant, but I tense up waiting for the next line or move because I've been conditioned to fear even innocuous comments. I don't want to have to go out every day into a world like this. We're better than that.

Thankfully, I have not experienced any of this on campus, which gives me hope. Through discussion and awareness, I believe that changes will be made, and I trust the Cornell community to lead the progress."

So after my first semester at Cornell, my GPA is a 4.06. How excited about this should I be? I'm taking harder courses next semester because I came here to be challenged. I don't want to become overconfident and overload myself, but I really want to put myself to the test and see what I'm capable of. I've never gotten below an A- in my life, and I want to have my first B, because that will mean that I was challenged and learned a lot and focused on my learning rather than the grade. Idk what advise do people have? I don't usually talk about my grades and GPA because I don't want to brag, so I kind of wanted to let off this steam and excitement. I mean, I have a 4.06 at Cornell, a big scary Ivy where I was worried about failing! Am I celebrating too soon? It must get harder from here."

I feel like I'm not pretty enough to rush. I'm not so ugly, I get guys and sex but that's not the point. I hate being in pictures. I'm not super peppy, I'm not a fan of hugging or being all sisterly. I would feel so awkward seeing all these smiley people, even on bid day, having to be super huggy and happy. Though I of course appreciate the sisterhood, and that's part of why I want to rush. I barely have friends and had a bad first semester. I want to meet more people, friends and people to go out with. I don't really go out as much as I'd like, so I think a sorority would be good for that. But at the same time, I don't want to have to suck up to everyone I see for a week. I'm not a huge partier, but I drink some and like chill gatherings. I'm just not a sorority type girl, so I'm afraid I really won't like it. Any advice would be appreciated."

After crunching the numbers, it seems like my graduating cumulative GPA will be a 3.25 in the most ideal scenario (which will almost certainly not happen). Can I even get into any medical school at this point? What else is there to do with a bio degree? This is pretty distressing.

I am at peace. I can write. I can be fully myself--especially all the wonderful parts that I hide from everyone in Ithaca. I can write. I can play with my little brother. I can stay out until 4:30 in the morning with my best friends. I can write. I can hug and kiss my mother 10 times a day. I can immerse myself in the culture of my family and friends and city. I can write. I am in love with these moments and with this time.

Even so, I can't say that I don't look forward to returning to school. Certainly not now, or anytime soon. But when the new semester does eventually roll around, I won't be complaining. 

Everything's good now and everything will be good later, I've decided. I have PLENTY to be upset about, both here and there. But I don't feel like dumping all of that on you today. Like 7225 said, I'm not in the mood to contribute to the negativity right now, though I would add that I welcome every ounce of concern, sadness, and pain from others on this page.

One thing I promised myself I would do is to never compare myself to others when I entered Cornell.  I lied.  Everyday I always compared my GPA to my business friends and my success to my engineering friends in finding internships.  And it would always make me feel terrible about myself and how I am not doing well.

Other benefits -- no more alarms, you get to sleep as much as you want; going to class leisurely in the morning and being fresh and attentive when everyone else is struggling to stay awake; your professors will appreciate your focus, attention and attitude; you get to have breakfast for dinner!

When I first came to Cornell I never imagined I would join a sorority. I thought it was stupid, shallow, and elitist. I never drank in H.S., and never saw myself as the type to party or engage in the hook up culture. What I didn't realize, though, is how much those stereotypes don't hold true and how I would really come to value being involved in huge community at Cornell. I know that there exists so much tension at our school between Greeks and non-Greeks, but sometimes I wonder if it has to be that way. I acknowledge the valid reasons that the Greek system can represent a lot of harmful aspects of our society. I know the Greek system tends to be a hierarchy that is too obsessed with wealth, appearances, alcohol/drugs, and high-risk sex and how it tends to be noninclusive of minorities, lower socioeconomic groups, and LGBTQ peers. I know. These issues deeply affect me and force me to question my involvement with the Greek system. But, every time I think deeply enough about my involvement I remember all the people I've met in frats and sororities at Cornell who also care a lot about these issues, feel the same way animosity towards the culture, and recognize it's need for reform. I've met so many people who not only recognize these issues but belong to inclusive houses on this campus that don't represent those stereotypes. My experience in my sorority has been utterly invaluable to me because of the great people I've met and how much it's allowed me to connect with people on this campus who are both in and out of the Greek system. Not to mention how much fun it is. Honestly, it's such a huge community that it's really one of the best parts of such a depressing and isolating school like Cornell. Sometimes I wish more people would be open-minded about the Greek system so that we can begin reforming it from the inside. But maybe I'm just an idealist."

In light of the decision to combine AEM, Johnson and The Hotel School into one unified College of Business, I cannot express how sad this makes me. Ever since I was five years old I knew I wanted to come to the Hotel School. It has always been my dream to open restaurants, and I knew that the Hotel School was the stepping-stone to make this dream a reality. As a second year Hotelie, I can’t help but feel anger and confusion about this decision. I have become passionate about my home school and the thought of it being absorbed into something so generic and bureaucratic makes me furious. 

With no Hotelie representation within the newly appointed Deans of the College of Business, I am afraid that we will lose the culture and distinction that makes us so special. I am afraid we will become a tiny department within a larger entity that favors finance and marketing classes over wine and culinary classes. Combining the Hotel School, AEM, and Johnson under one umbrella institution will dilute the brands and reputations of each of these amazing Schools.

The Hotel School is the best school in the world for people passionate about hospitality. I have made my best friends here. I have found likeminded people who care about hospitality as much as I do. This decision is a slippery slope to eliminate a program that many people at Cornell and in academia seem to not understand. I have never felt such pride to be a Hotelie and such shame to be a Cornellian. I will continue to fight this decision and continue to speak out against it. I am proud to call myself a #hotelie4life.

Sincerely, 

A Passionate and Concerned Hotelie"

What I miss is having that person, you know? I'm sure I'll find someone great someday, maybe soon, maybe not. But I'm impatient, I guess. I want my person again. Someone to tell random things to, to listen to music with, to rant to and watch Netflix with, to be crazy and stupid with and to talk about life and intellectual things. Someone to study with, or not study with, to have crazy sex with and to cuddle and do absolutely nothing with. And yeah, I know everyone wants this and I'm being stupid and just have to let it happen. Sure, I've moved on. I've been with other people.

I was supposed to graduate May '14, then this upcoming May, and now it looks like it might even be December. I have been through a million challenges and wanted to just give up and go home so many times... And for the first time I'm truly glad I didn't. I'm finally starting to feel like ""me"" again for the first time in years, and I've allowed myself to connect to the campus. I'm happy and content for the first time in what seems like forever, despite still being in the middle of finals and personal challenges... And this is a pretty awesome realization for me. Keep pushing through guys... There is a point where things will turn around for you as they have for me. Also, don't be afraid to ask for help - I've had lots along the way.

It seems like I am living in the former Soviet Union having to hide my religious beliefs for fear of prosecution. If students get offended they can kiss my ass. I'm serious how can an adult student get offended by decorations? It just doesn't make sense. If you don't like it don't look at it.

As a closeted gay guy, it's really hard to find guys that are of ""good quality"". What I mean by good quality is someone with a great personality, someone that can make me smile, laugh and loves to talk, drink wine and listen to Adele (now Adele 25). For me that's an ideal man. But... since I am closeted, I have had no choice but to get into Grindr, a hookup app for gay men. 

On Grindr, you find all sorts of guys, but it's a hookup app (mainly for sex; rarely for dating) and it's hard for me to find someone (or at least get a taste of someone) that is what I am really looking for. Don't get me wrong... I have met both good and bad guys from Grindr. Some of them were cold (just wanted to come and go), some of them weren't intimate enough and some other were amazing!!!!!!, such as the guy I recently met. 

But... it's still not what I'm looking for. I feel disgusted after hooking up with some guys. I feel this is not really me doing this and sometimes I feel that I do it not because I have the desire, but the impulse of actually doing it (not sure if I am clear). Like... I don't do it because I want to get off (I prefer masturbation over Tumblr videos than a cold encounter from Grindr). I don't really know why I do it. I log in into the app and chat with some people, and things happen. But I don't like how I feel after encounters; this makes me realize that I am not the hookup type. 

What do I do then? I am a closeted gay guy. I have tried to tell some of my friends but it's hard. In fact, I told one of my sisters, and she didn't believe me until I actually had to describe her some of my encounters and what gay guys """"do"""". I am nervous, anxious, happy, sad, strong,weak, etc all at the same time when it comes to this business. But good thing is that I have already promised myself that I won't hide it if someone comes and asks me (no one has asked me whether I am gay or not), so if you think you know who I am, come and ask me. I will tell you the truth. This will help me a lot and make me more confident.

I will appreciate if some of you leave some tips on how should I proceed with this. I really want to come out before my senior year so that I can have really fun memories before graduation and find a SO."

Many of you post on here complaining how you didn't get accepted and how you're grades aren't exactly up to par due to the difficulty of the curriculum, atmosphere, etc. Some of you might even give up on your dreams because of how far south things have gone. But I just wanted to add some fresh perspective to this notion of the """"pristine"""" college student with the best internships who ends up becoming a roaring success. I have personally known students who have come from even the shittiest of colleges and have made a name for themselves on Wall Street, medicine, and engineering. The schools you attend only tell part of the story. One person I know actually went to a school ranked something in the 600s and had an acceptance rate of 75%. But today she's working as an equity research analyst for a top tier bank in NYC. I also know of 1 individual who lacks a technical background, attended a so-called """"crap"""" school and has just received 4 million in venture fund capital for his start-up. My own friend who was at the bottom of our high school class, went to a large state school, is today going to a well-respected medical school. 

The fact that you got into and succeeded at Cornell does not make you any better or worse than anyone else. But if you're a student at this school, there's a damn good chance that you have some hidden potential within you. 

Success does not come down to just your academic pedigree, your grades, and your fancy internships. Passion and hard work count for a great deal in this world. It might take some time and some luck..but I'm certain that most of you can achieve your dreams as well. 

Good Luck"

I have always been hot tempered and I feel that my friends here are starting to realize that and distance themselves.

""I've liked you since the first day of freshman year. We were from the same place and we shared so many interests. Your being here and succeeding showed me that I could survive in this place as well. 

Yet i could never bring myself to tell you how I felt. I know that you don't feel the same way, so there was no point in asking. Not that I would have wanted you to say yes. They say that you can't be happy with somebody else until you are happy with yourself. Well I've been working on improving myself so that I can like myself better. However, it was too little too late. I'm still not at the point that I want to be at, and I'm going to be away next semester. That means that I wont be able to see you for at least 8 months, when I come back in the fall. 

Maybe I'll finally be able to forget you after all that time, or maybe I wont. When I come back, maybe I'll finally be at the point where I can like myself enough to even consider the possibility that you might like me back, or maybe I wont."""

So long-story short, I'm having a young-life crisis or rather an ""A-ha"" moment regarding my professional plans.  I recently changed my major and I'm even taking classes outside of Cornell. Anyway, I just want to address how thankful I am to be in a college that allows me the flexibility to totally revamp my plans at the stage that I am at! I can't imagine how I could ever make it through Cornell, stuck in a path I've simply lost interest in. Finals aren't even over, yet I can't help but think about next semester in my new major! For the first time in a while I feel genuinely happy and grateful. Merry Christmas, Hanukkah, etc. everyone, hug someone you love today."

This term, I've started doing something - i guess it would be considered self harm-  again. I am terrified to go home because my parents might notice. I've gotten it over control, but there are still signs. I have to go get a physical (with my pediatrician) and I'm 98% sure she will notice. I'm legally an adult, so I know she should tell my parents, but I'm afraid she will. I'm hoping i can go by myself, in which case, i think i can talk to my doctor and explain. but if my mom comes with (which is more than likely) I'm screwed. I'm afraid she will try to make me leave cornell. or act really awkward around me. My parents are very un-emotional. I know they love me, but they don't know how to express their feelings or talk about anything. so they just watch me. constantly. which only makes everything worse. I'm more stress about the prospect of going home then finals. i actually hoping the plane crashes or something. I don't know what to do."

I dislike the label ""white"". My family comes from a poorer ""white"" country. I have lived in the US my whole life, but did not grow up with cable TV, video games, or a cellphone. When I was in high school, my parents took us to visit their home country and some areas are unbelievably poor. The majority of Cornell students have no idea. It's one thing to see a picture or write a paper with internet research, and another to spend more than a day there.

My immigrant parents worked harder than I ever will. This country is run by immigrants because they will do whatever it takes. If they get knocked down, they get right back up, no questions asked."

I must be the saddest person in the history of the universe! It's been a year since I had sex, a year and a half since I had sex sober and four years since I have had a boyfriend. I am not ugly (I hope) and while I might come of as obnoxious cos of my pointedly liberal and feminist believes, I am a nice person overall. I am chill, cool, drink wine and whiskey with equal ease and I am open to trying out anything. Then why am I so lonely and desperate? I mean, I get it, guys my age are not looking for serious relationships and neither am I. I would like a sweet, nice guy who I can hang out with, talk to and have sex with. Or maybe just even have sex with, at this point! Is that too much to ask????"

I have never lost anyone but I have had dreams where I've lost people close and dear to me. Even in those dreams I felt truly devastated, lonely, and hopeless. As much as I would love to end things and save myself the pain of living in this world, everytime I get close to taking my life, I see his face and I can't bear to be the one that delivers a blow like that to him. I should be thankful for him in every way possible (and I am) but I can't help feeling angry at him for giving me a reason to live. Sometimes I feel so sorry that I am the one he fell in love with."

If I see you in public, I shouldn't have to worry about whether or not it's cool to acknowledge each other without having to explain to either of our friends that ""we just hookup"".

This is for 7186.

I was rejected from Cornell regular decision. To be honest, I was rejected from every single school I applied to (including my ED school) except for 3 in-state public schools. It was devastating and and for a long time, I thought my intelligence was tied with the name of my school. It took me a long time to realize that your college does not define you and your college experience is truly what you make of it. I eventually transferred after my freshman year and was accepted into a few schools, including Cornell. So, if Cornell is truly your dream, it is possible to transfer into this school. Either way, I just wanted to let you know that I know how you feel and I wish you joy and happiness for whatever happens throughout your application process."

However, I get very annoyed when people claim to have seen the world, when the only ""abroad"" they had seen were the fancy little cafes of Paris or the ancient buildings in tourist cities. 

No kidding people cannot empathize or even sympathize with people who are struggling from climate change, war zones, extreme poverty, and more - they've never come close to witnessing their toils. 

So the next time you think that pollution isn't an issue, or that people abroad are poor and homeless because they don't work as hard as Americans, please stop yourself from offending someone who can empathize with those affected."

I need to find out who this girl is. She's probably the most beautiful human being I have ever seen. I saw her once in the bus to the Ithaca Mall, once on the bus to NYC for October Break, and around campus walking to class a couple times. Please help me find her. Even if you do, I probably will never have the guts to actually talk to her. But I'm content in admiring her beauty from afar.
Okay so, she has beautiful, porcelain light skin. She has a boy cut, her hair is kind of dark. I'm not exactly sure what color because the times I've seen her, she was wearing a beanie. She dresses like a tomboy - she had sweats but like the skinny sweatpants, like the ""jogger"" type. I think that's what it's called. Oh, and she wore Vans, the specific ones she wore were called ""Sk8-hi slim"" and they were black. 
She has such beautiful features, a real classic beauty. 
Wow, I'm reading this back now and I sound like I belong on ""To Catch a Predator"" or something. I swear I'm not a stalker, every time I saw her I was so excited and surprised that I ran into her. I'm not a stalker, I'm just a little freshman who has never believed in ""love at first sight"" until now. I have a huge crush on this girl and I just want to know her name. I haven't even spoken a word to her but I wish I did. Anyway, to this mystery girl: you are so beautiful and intriguing and I can tell you have such an interesting and beautiful mind.
I haven't seen her around campus in a while...I hope I can see her at least one more time before break!!! Stay beautiful, mystery girl."

Well, my last semester at Cornell is coming to an end. No, I'm not leaving here with a degree. I am transferring out to another university in the Spring. You'd probably expect this post to be a bash on the stress and isolation of Cornell that affects its students. While this is true, and stress and isolation have had a big impact on my time here, this is not the reason for my post. I believe it was my own fault that resulted in my withdrawal from Cornell. I did not make the most of my time here because of my life circumstances, and myself. This is a prestigious school, and I was just starting to make good friends here that I will soon let go of. A part of me wishes I could stay, but a part of me wants to leave, and because of personal and life issues, leaving was the path that I chose. I have no idea what the future holds for me, and I am anxious to find out and continue my journey that is life.

Freshman year I was rejected by a girl who I considered my best friend at the time. Me being so insecure, that really hit a nerve. After that I vowed to myself to never put myself out there like that again. The less you care about people the less it hurts later. I never let anyone near me. Three years later and I can honestly say that outside of my immediate family no one knows me well. And I like it that way. People tell me I don't work on relationships and blah, blah, blah. They don't know that I do it on purpose. I don't open myself up so they don't open themselves up. That way we both don't care about each other and there is no chance of getting hurt. I don't blame her at all. When I see her around campus, we never acknowledge each others existence and it bothers me a bit because its so awkward. But it means we don't have to talk and shit and that's good. I know. I don't handle rejection well."

As a senior who has a job after graduation, is it really necessary for me to give a shit about finals? As long as my overall GPA doesn't dip too low, does it even matter whether I get Cs in a couple of classes? I'm just feeling overwhelmed with all the studying I have to do and it's so tempting just to give up and watch YouTube videos. As long as I'm able to graduate do my grades really matter? Sure, I'll be fucked if I want to apply to grad school (there go my dreams to do research) but honestly, coming to Cornell has only made me realize how much my intelligence (or lack thereof) has limited my ambitions. My only goal is to graduate and live a life where I'm happy. So I'm just tempted to give up on this whole finals thing and for once, enjoy the days leading up to the holidays."

I used to have a friend at Cornell, but the friendship didn't last more than a few months. My friend had mental issues and I was trying to help them with finding the right path, but unfortunately they always wanted it their way even though they were wrong most of the time. But time reveals the truth and more and more the things we debated on are proving accurate. The recent shooting, which actually happened near my former friend's hometown, actually proved I was right on the issues, and we need to fix a lot of the issues our country has rather than be passive and hope for the best....that will get us down the wrong path. :( I hope one day they can come to the realization that I was only trying to help them, make sure they were safe..........Maybe they will never realize it and it saddens me everyday that sometimes you cannot help people."

I think we're both pretty introverted people, which makes things tough. And I think you might be uncomfortable with any type of obvious public acknowledgment, considering how young this is.

But I also think--and hope--that this will get better with time. And it's certainly worth the effort, because I really think there's something between us worth building on."

I am the most conservative person on this campus, and I am voting for Donald Trump come this election. If only the non-conservative people I associate at Cornell knew, I would need to hire a private armed body guard. I support all of Donald Trump's measures because he follows the logic of my favorite talk show host, Michael Savage. If only people listened to Michael Savage, we could make this country great again and reduce the problems that exists. I wish I could come out to more people and they could embrace me, rather than shun my beliefs."

I'm sorry but that is awful advice. You're basically saying forget passion, be practical. How could you advise someone you truly care about to settle for an unfulfilling career for the next decade?Some people have souls. If this person truly feels that art is their calling, have demonstrated the ability to succeed as an artist, and will do whatever it takes to live their dreams everyday, nothing will stop them. Not their parents, friends, or you. When someone is willing to leave engineering for art, maybe they never wanted to be engineer. When we decided how to spend the rest of our lives in high school as teenagers, some of us got it wrong, some of us were pressured by society,parents, egos, etc. 
Anyway, most people here have some form intelligence, I'm sure your friend has considered the risks. Clearly, you're afraid, maybe you aren't happy with your prospective career? Your friend isn't afraid and they have proven such."

The arrogance of many of the engineering students I know here is hilarious. One has literally told me, to my face, that he or she could do everything I do at Cornell (I'm in Arts & Sciences). No, you fucking can't; You're only taking courses in one field that you are (presumably) interested and excel in. Yes, Engineering does have the ""liberal studies"" requirement, but it is in no way a liberal arts curriculum, and engineering students are able to use AP credit to fulfill any of these breadth requirements. As an Arts and Sciences student, I am not able to do this, and I can't really use any of the ≈40 AP credits I have earned. I'm required to take high-level courses (e.g. a 2000+ level language course) across multiple different subjects. 

Regardless of whether I think I could complete the Engineering requirements at Cornell, there is a huge difference between taking all of your courses in the broad field (STEM) or narrow subject that you're strong in, and taking rigorous courses across multiple subjects in addition to your major. Get off your high fucking horse."

It irritates me to no end how much the Western world's value of free speech has been eroded in today's stifling politically-correct atmosphere. If we can't be honest with ourselves and work to assess the intrinsic worth of certain ideas or cultures that may be detrimental to our development as a society, why pretend that we are in any way better than the insular theocracies and dictatorships that have hindered human growth both in the past and today? America, the UK, France, and many other so-called ""bastions of free speech"" have failed to live up to the freedoms that were so hard-won by the blood of martyrs and political heroes. We no longer uphold progressive values when we cannot speak without fear of being silenced or cowed into submission by ad hominems including, but not limited to the following: racist, insert-vocal-minority-group-phobe, bigot, heartless cretin, etc. If any group claiming to represent certain ideological systems or subcultures feels it has been spited by the actions of a privileged majority, the key to addressing these issues is not by militant and verbose criticism of those in power. The only viable solution in a society that has progressed to the point of allowing an equal political platform to voice their grievances is through thoughtful debate and discussion. Any minority group that seeks to accomplish anything through other means ultimately betrays itself. Non-violent resistance may have been appropriate in an age when this was not possible. But to say that this is the only venue today? It is probable then that the ideas and values that that minority group espouses would probably not hold water in a proper debate setting. 
       Universities and governments have already progressed, and are still progressing, enough to protect equality--at least nominally--in the legal world. But the more and more it encroaches upon our fundamental rights as human beings, the further and further it treads into the realm of the absurd. Save for a few brave souls who publish satire and editorials without fear, much of western media has already bent to the will of particular groups over others. When the state and bureaucratic systems begin to coddle one group over another by nurturing a so-called minority's pride over the rights and freedoms of other groups, it is, I think, appropriate to deem it a symptom of cultural regression. 

Feel free to disagree if you wish by committing fallacies of logical reasoning and claiming you uphold liberal values, but I think if context were stripped from the recent events that have occurred on university campuses and the media in the past few years, and people were to analyze each situation through unbiased eyes, they would note that western society as a whole has moved from the constrained and restrictive atmosphere of the 1940's and '50's to a setting of hypocritical and unbridled chaos in which it is deemed liberal and positive in certain instances to speak out against bad ideas, but racist, phobic, or bigoted to speak out against others. 

Ideas and personages are not deemed infallible by virtue of their being members or by-products of minorities. It may be ill-tempered, in bad taste, and inappropriate to publish certain cartoons, or send certain letters or e-mails, or tweet certain things. But criticism, however satirical, however offensive should not even be discouraged. If your group--whether religious or cultural--is truly grounded in the incontrovertible truth or holds the higher moral ground, then logic will prevail and open our eyes to reality. Societies only progress when this messy, uncomfortable, but free exchange of ideas takes place in a public setting. That remains true for France, for the UK, for Yale, and a plethora of other places that should allow intellectual discourse, but are unfortunately being silenced by those who wish to apply free speech to themselves, but not to others. 

P.S. I know C. Confessions is a platform for sexually frustrated, anxious, and stressed out students. I don't mean to take away from your problems, fellow students. But I hope to catch the eyes of a few of you who have not yet mulled this over. Also, I am a pretty reserved individual in real life and don't get the chance to talk about this often and this really bothers me."

Have I overstayed my welcome?

Something seemed off yesterday. I felt like there was something they knew that I didn't, although whether or not I was supposed to know is beyond me. I’m usually the one who always wins. I’m the one who people need. I'm the one who doesn’t need people, right? I’m the one who doesn’t care, right? Yet I left that place over-analyzing every interaction for some reason, wondering about myself. When you stand out so much already, the margin of error is low. I want to tell myself I was thinking too hard. But I’ll never know.

Some people seemed wary of me this time, and more than the usual, expected amount of wariness that comes with being so unexpected. Joyful people were subdued in their greetings. I feel like I made mistakes that I don't usually mistake, but I can't determine the specifics. Someone said I was welcome, and I know I am. Still, at the same time, some people sounded like they didn’t believe themselves when speaking acceptance into reality. Almost like they regretted lying.

Sometimes, briefly, in moments of awkwardness, I get a sense that I am still a surprise, when maybe I don’t want to be anymore. Is it because I am not emotional enough? Did I say the wrong thing? I wish I could slough off this cloak of fear, doubt, and uneasiness surrounding me. I've never wanted to be apart of something more badly than I did at that moment. I've never wanted to be accepted, to be apart of the group, more than I do for these people. 

I hope I'm overthinking all of this."

We don't want to be that girl you just want to ""hook up"" with. We want to make sure you respect us and that your feelings are true.

You don't strike me at all as someone who doesn't care about your life. It sounds like you're just trying to figure out who you are and where you belong. Walks and discrete mixes help a lot with figuring that out. My advise, for what it's worth - if you find engineering interesting, keep at it. Make a career out of doing something good for the world with it. Take art as a minor. In 10 or whatever years, if you want to make art or something else your thing, you'll have the money from engineering to make a smooth transition. You may not care about money now, but once you have to start paying rent and electric and buying food and insurance and then your car needs repaired and your dog needs surgery, you'll be glad you have the financial ability to do so. Just stay away from debt. Ok that's it. Keeping being good to yourself. I think you'll be just fine."

Take the time before you leave this semester (or before everyone else leaves) to tell your friends and family that you love them. Tell them how much they mean to you, it can make a big difference in both of your lives.
This semester has been an emotional roller coaster for me; my best friend from back home was in a near fatal accident and spent a week in critical condition at the hospital (while I sat helplessly here), my sister was diagnosed with a life threatening disorder, I've spent more time sick and bed-ridden than not, and I've struggled to stay up in my classes because of it, at a time where my GPA and job prospects are slipping away from me. But through all that, I was able to meet a girl who I love more than anything else in the world right now. She has changed the way I look at myself and my other relationships. I realized that no matter what shit I was going through, I needed to take the time to put everything in perspective. I now take the time once a week or so to tell her a small thing about how much she means to me - making myself feel better in the process, and inspiring me to be the person that she is for me, for my other friends and loved ones.
I know how hard it is sometimes to be positive here at Cornell, with academics, the weather, social isolation, or whatever else. I don't have many friends either. And I fucking hate the winter. But it's better for you in the long run to put in that work to be positive, and to be a positive influence on others. So tell your friends and family how much you care about them; you might be surprised how much they truly care about you, too."

There's always a reacher and a settler. I'm happy to say I have finally stopped settling after you brought nearly nothing to the table. Sometimes you only realize a situation is not what you wanted at all when you finally have the bravery to let go of it. Now all I ask is that you stop reaching for me by attempting to live peripherally in my life. Do you realize how pathetic this last stunt of yours was? All it did was reflect horribly on you and make you look desperate af. We all know you're desperate, but have some self respect and at last try and hide it. I tried to be friendly to you because I felt bad and because I suck at holding grudges, but from this point forward let us be strangers to one another. I don't know you(I don't think I ever knew you beyond the construct I had built up in my mind) and I don't want to know you."

I lost my grandpa almost one year ago. We've been talking over phone calls since I came to college. Because of his bizarre life path, he knew a lot of things, from rocket science to composite materials. My grandpa was always my source of inspiration, and I'm proud to be his pride. After he passed away, I couldn't count how many times I dreamed of him and found myself waking up in tears. Sometimes I felt guilty because I screwed my school work up, and I was afraid that he'd be disappointed at me. My relationship with my parents is not particularly well; we get along well, but I just don't find that much confidence and inspiration my grandpa gave me. I feel so lost now; I really wish I can drag myself out of that mentality, but I just can't."

Going back to my comment about building the people mover system at Cornell, I decided to scrap my plans and instead invest in more extensive people mover systems at Cornell since it comes to my attention with all the latest market research I have done that students at Cornell would be too cheap to pay $2.75 per month or $150 a month in order to justify building my system. I simply would not get enough students to pay in order to make a profit, unless of course I could get the university to subsidize the rides instead of subsidizing the disgusting TCAT buses."

My favorite thing to do is to mix coke and whisky in a bottle and go for long walks around campus and Ithaca. Its a good way to relax. I guess one of the benefits of being a guy is that its not really dangerous. If you notice a guy with bottle of coke in his hand just lounging around, feel free to say hi. On these long walks, I do a lot of thinking. Mostly random stuff. Sometimes I think about how little I actually care about my life. I don't really want/need a high-paying job. Partly because I don't know what to do with the money. I don't have a lot of loans. I don't spend on clothes or food. I really only eat a meal a day. My hobbies are inexpensive so what am I supposed to do with the money. I don't care where I end up. I wouldn't care if I died tomorrow. I'm pretty much a lone wolf anyway. Sometimes I think about what if I chose a different major. My parents picked engineering for me and I just went with it. Turns out it's pretty interesting. But what if I chose art? or history? or wines? It's weird that I've also thought about a detailed plan to kill myself if I ever want to. I don't know if I'm depressed.

Been hearing and reading a lot of news about all the time and money going toward this Anabel's Grocery project. Can someone explain to me what the big deal or importance of this project is, because I'm not seeing it. I understand that food is an issue on campus, but they keep making it sound like it's a food supply issue and our current issue is not supply, its cost. Everyone knows the on-campus grocery stores suck but we have many nearby ones with bus distance- Target, Tops, Wal-Mart, Wegmans, and Aldis, and all students have bus passes. I'm an upperclassmen without a meal plan and I use the bus when needed to get to any local grocery store to get the groceries I need , so accessibility is not difficult or limited to only people with cars. The only value I see in investing in this grocery store on campus is if they're going to be cheaper than those markets or provide financial aid for food. If not, I honestly don't see how this addresses the issue of food security and I see it as a waste of money unless someone can better explain the value of it."

You youngsters don't know what it means to have grown up during hard times. All you do is complain how hard Cornell is and how much work you have or how society is giving you a hard time. Try growing up during the Depression like my parents did, raised us, World War II happened, and then we had to cut back on basic necessities to support the American troops and war material movements. I then attended school at Cornell, served in the Korean War and returned back to finish my education. That was the real deal folks. My parents and I grew up during the worst of times and made it through believing in faith and that God would help us through. We sure made it and grew up knowing not to take things for granted and how to have respect. We don't go pose selfishly for pictures in front of everything and we don't complain about everything like many of you youngsters do. We did not go waste our parent's money on coffee from expensive chains like many of you do and complain about inequality. We worked our butts of to get where we are. I don't know what depression even is because the hard times made me who I am today and that is a very strong individual like my parents were. My children and grandchildren were raised right and grew up to appreciate things and not complain about everything. They still do not spend money on bullshit and take selfish pictures.  They also know how to respectfully talk to others and not spend their lives looking down at their phones."

Today's university libraries are little more than Starbucks with internet, no one is actually reading the books, they are just using the workspace and internet. Well you probably have a desk with internet in your apartment/room. So why go to the library? Why be confined by a narrow space and social norms when you can eat, talk to yourself, be dressed however you like, and be as comfortable as you like in your own home while studying, surrounded by your things? To me studying is a personal thing. I absolutely don't understand why the vast majority of people go to ""libraries"" to do it. I tried it. I do much better at home."

People bump into me on the sidewalks and reach over me or sometimes sit on my things (even me) on the bus.

I'm in love with two different women. One is my girlfriend. We have been together forever and we know everything about each other. I can think things and she can know it without me having to say anything. I'm always comfortable around her and we love each other deeply. Spending time together is always fun. That's not to mention that we have been through everything together. Our life together would be amazing; I know it.

The other women is a close friend. We spend time together, work on classes, and generally have fun. But there are times where I can see myself with her as part of a couple. I can see myself getting to know her better and it seems like an entirely new adventure. It is really difficult to just be friends and the attraction is definitely there.

I wish that people would stop perpetuating racial stereotypes by making crass and un-funny racially-motivated jokes about people that they've never met. I'm black. My parents (who are married, and have been for almost 30 years) make quite a bit of money. We've never lived in the ghetto, and we almost certainly never will. We tip generously. I think that BLM has some good points, but some of their more militant ideas, and how they go about communicating those ideas to people, turn me off. I had straight As (except for one B+) in high school and good SATs, so I'm pretty sure affirmative action wasn't my ticket into Cornell. But reading things like ""black people score lower than other races on standardized tests; they wouldn't get into college without AA"" gets tiring, and very often leads to assumptions being made on my (and other black people's) intelligence, before I (we) even get a chance to demonstrate my (our) skills and work ethic.

Reading and hearing that stereotypes still play such a huge role in how people view members of your race - as though we are all carbon copies of one another - gets really old, really fucking fast, especially when you fit almost none of the stereotypes associated with your race. I just wish people would realize how harmful these assumptions are, stop making them, and actually attempt to educate themselves by talking to people and listening to their experiences. People aren't the caricatures that you think they are."

I graduated in engineering at Cornell coming from a poor family and being the first one in my family to go to high school and graduate college. I still talk simple or like I ""come from the slum"" according to the way people giggle when I talk to them. They don't consider me educated in any way. My family has no connections to really help me with jobs and I have not had one job interview since I graduated in engineering. I also don't have any real friends from my time at Cornell because it was hard for me to adjust to the environment here because a lot of people come from far more wealthier families than I do and I have trouble adapting to people's lifestyles. For instance I did not understand the resources that were available to me as a college student being first gen. I had to work long hours to support myself and to do well in school so I did not have much time for socializing either. The only job interview I recieved was to be a manual construction worker which I have accepted as I have no other choice and need to pay back some of my loans and sustain myself. It's back breaking work but I hope one day I can move up the ranks and become a foreman or supervisor. I now realize how hard life is to move up social classes even though I graduated from Cornell rising out of poverty. At least maybe one day I could help my children if I decide to have any, with either going to school and finding a job or finding something out of high school. Some nights I cry about the fact that I've wasted my time at Cornell as I had no direction in life since my parents did not have any advice to offer about college or high school. My guidance counselor told me going to college was the best thing to do...I guess not."

I am going to develop a project and a proposal to create a people mover system underneath Cornell with station entrances inside the most widely used buildings so people don't have to walk outside during the brutal winters. What's more is the people mover system will be near the massive steam mains going underneath the roads through Cornell. It will be a win-win with a warm tunnel where students who are willing to pay the fare could get to class. If you don't want to pay the fare, you can freeze your ass above ground when it reaches below 30F. I can then charge $2.75 or more per trip with a monthly pass available at $150. My whole system would be powered by electricity produced from Pennsylvania coal, natural gas, or nuclear power plants so that my expenses are minimal and the system could be reliable.

I’d really love some help. From anyone. 

As children, most of us want to make our parents proud. And that’s what I want. More than anything in the world. 

And I know that I’m not. I’m not making them proud because I’m failing here. I did really well in high school and managed to get here. I guess up to that point, it was easy for me. 

My parents aren’t rich. At all. They can barely afford Cornell and I try to pay as much as I can with my job. But they put everything on the line and just work so very hard for me. My older dad works in a different city than my mother and my mother went back to strenuous work at the age of 60 just to help with the costs.

I’ve always had the dream of being a doctor. I can’t imagine myself doing anything else in the world. Having been a healthcare worker in my hometown, I know that this is the only thing I could ever want. And so naturally, I joined the hordes of vicious pre-meds.

But as a sophomore student right now? My GPA stands at an outstanding 2.082. It just sickens me. My entire freshman year I was freaked out of my mind, stressed beyond anything, and just unable to get good grades. My letters came in D’s, C’s, and a few minority B’s. That year’s performance has depressed me beyond anything. I no longer feel happy about anything. In any way. 

My parents were upset, of course. But they aren’t the kinds of people to scream at me and hit and threaten me. I thought they would do that. But no, they were upset, and supported me after. Tried to make me smile, just simply told me “it’s okay. You’re just going to have to get better grades next year. Okay? Please do that, you have to”. 

And of course I want to. I need to. I pushed myself this semester so very hard to. Even to the point that I took the organic chemistry lab class without the lecture portion (because I still had to take general chemistry due to not being able to complete the general chem sequence last year) just to trying to show initiative. 

I’ve gotten much better grades this year, but my GPA will only be a 3.5. Which would only raise my overall GPA to 2.5. 

I’m trying. I really am. But I’m depressed. So severely depressed, yet I walk up that damn hill every day to go to these classes that seem impossible for me to compete in and get med-school worthy grades. 

When my parents smiled at me this Thanksgiving break, laughed for me, did everything they could to take me out to dinner and movies, and outings, despite me pleading for them not to, because of the costs, and because of me knowing I didn’t deserve anything? I just broke down inside. 

I couldn’t care less about myself. It’s my parents I care about more than anything. And I feel broken about how badly I have failed here. They know I have a dream and they want me to achieve that dream. But how can I? How can I considering how badly i’ve done my freshman year? And how slow and hard it will be to get my GPA to a good position??

I really wish killing myself was easy. To ease the financial burden on my parents. To erase the pain of a failure who probably won’t achieve their dreams and make their parents proud. 

My college has been so cold towards me on these issues. Restricting my classes and looking at me as a failure. Which I suppose I am.

Mum and Dad, I love you more than anything in the world. You sacrificed everything for me and all I want is to make you proud. 

I suppose I came to this page because crying isn’t enough. And I suppose I would just like a stranger’s impression of my situation. Or advice. I’d appreciate it so much."

I graduated and got as job. Now my parents are guilt-tripping me hard for wanting to move out, like ""why do you want to leave us, don't you love us?"" and similar sentiments. How can they not understand why I would want a place of my own, and not need to have them ok my every action and breathe down my neck for almost every decision I make? It's not like I don't love them, but every time this discussion comes up I'm apparently being selfish. What, do they expect me to live in this same house forever? They're already talking about arranging my marriage in a few years... like, I feel so goddamn stifled."

I knew I had problems with masturbation. I was very addicted to it; I used to do it at least 3 times a day. I mean, what else could a closeted gay guy do? Being closeted is not a pleasant experience at all because I can't be who I want to be, or talk to guys in a public manner (just like I'd do with friends). It's simply hard!

I have had Grindr for a long time and it was hard for some time because I'd not send a picture because of the fear of being exposed or """"out-ed"""". I had some encounters but not with the right people, and after having those encounters, I'd feel depressed because I'd regret them and then get back to a lot of masturbation. So I decided to start sharing my face on Grindr just to see if I could have more quality moments with other guys that would not normally respond because I didn't have a profile picture so I could stop masturbating so much.

And it did happen. I have met 2 really sweet guys (individually) in the past 2 weeks with whom I had a great experience and a connection with them I never had with anyone before. I have stayed away from masturbation ever since then because I actually fell in love with one of them. Yes. It was love at first sight. He's the ideal guy for me. He was sweet, caring, careful, very masculine, tall, mature, etc. But he's 29 and I'm barely 20, and to make it worse, I met him in a trip to NYC so we live in different places.

He was sweet, made me have a great time when I visited him and has had me thinking about him the entire week. He didn't log into Grindr for 5 days!!! I was going crazy. I couldn't focus during my classes for the entire week because I just kept daydreaming and remembering all of his words, his voice, etc. I needed to tell him how I felt about him and that I wanted to see him again and so I did when he logged in again on 11/29 and he told me that was really sweet. He said that if I lived in nyc we could get to know each other better and talk but I am sure that the age difference prevents him from feeling the same about me. Like, he's a stable person, even with a PhD, and I'm barely a junior in college.

So here goes my hopes of falling in love for a long time. I know too much happened in my head in only one week but I never felt like this about anyone, not even about the previous girlfriends I had before admitting to myself I had a thing for men. Now, I'm really sad and not sure how I will deal with the next 2 weeks of the semester left and get back to nyc knowing nothing will happen between us. 

P.S. I also don't have the energy to masturbate. So I guess this situation will help me stay away from it for a looooong time."

I had an eating disorder for 7 years now. I can't go a day without being scared of my disorder. I love food and but i hate myself from the first bite. I started this disorder because people used to make fun of me for being fat. I lost the weight but I am paying the price by being mediocre and weak at a time in my life where I should be working towards my goals. If only I could go back in time ,I would go slap myself in the past when I first started this behavior. I wish the people who called me fat never did. People make so many off handed comments without realizing the consequences. I know I should have been strong and shouldn't have let those comments get to me. But I am human. I was a teenager, lonely and badly wanted to make friends. I didn't want people to be disgusted by me. I think I am a fun,interesting and a creative person underneath all my layers of fat. I wish someone would appreciate me for who I am. I wish someone would treat me like a pretty girl too.

I love you, but I can't tell you. Because I know you doesn't feel the same way. Guess I'm just not perfect enough for you.

I constantly look back to the times we spent together. The cuddles and jokes. The arm you wrapped around me. The gentle care. Maybe it doesn't mean much to you, just two friends hanging out. But it means the world to me.
Remember the time when we said goodbye. I smiled and waved, and turned around and cried silently. Because I hope those few days had lasted forever. Yes we will still see each other around, but it would not have been the same. 
I wish you forever happy and young, like the guy I hopelessly fall in love with that winter. I wish you would one day meet a girl you love. I wish you would take her on adventures, skiing or visiting museums, walking along the gorges of Ithaca on a bright winter day, just like we used to do. I wish you would kiss her at that moment, just like what I hoped you would do, but never did.

Were they just pretending I looked fine before? If I gain back the weight will I no longer be ""the way I should""?

To #7052, the confused TA:

I have seen this happen too (I'm not American). I TA a big class, and I've felt this a lot too. The prof - who has a reputation for being a friendly, down-to-earth guy - barely ever acknowledges me, but is friendly with the other TAs. He knows only my last name, and has mispronounced it at least half the times we have spoken. He never says anything other than what is required, and just nods when I make conversation. With the other TAs he'll discuss everything from their careers to their dinners.

I would speculate that it could be something to do with me not fitting in with a majority-white course staff, but that is not true. Both my off campus jobs involved working in offices full of white people, and I had no such problems in either of the places. People treated me like they did the other interns, I never felt left out in any way. It was like people never saw race.

TAing is a thankless job if you look for validation from profs or your peers. My satisfaction comes from other aspects of this process.  I don't really care about the professor recognizing me, but I think you do and you should know that you aren't alone. 

I think a lot of weird social stratification I see is part of the Cornell culture somehow. I have always felt at ease and involved interacting with Americans off campus, whether it's a job or karaoke night. I thought this country was very unfriendly until I spent a couple summers (+semester) elsewhere."

When I was in first grade, I got a winter Barbie doll as a Christmas gift. I loved this doll! But I lost one of her shoes and was devastated. One day I was playing in front of the mirror and I saw a blue shoe in the reflection and I thought it was the missing shoe. I was jubilant and so grateful for a second (this might have been one of the happiest moments of my life tbh because it was such a pure and innocent happiness), until I realized it was just the original shoe I hasn't lost. If there was anyway we could start over, I would feel the same way I felt when I thought I found that lost shoe. As a child, I blamed myself for losing that shoe. I don't blame myself for us breaking up because it was a two way effort, but I know there were things I could have done differently and I know there were things you could have done differently. I know it's insane  since we ended on such an acerbic note and I can't think of a time when our relationship wasn't tumultuous so getting back together would only be a quick fix for some discomfort I'm experiencing now and only hurt me more later. Perhaps this is just the me who is still healing and dealing with the aftermath of our breakup speaking because it could very well be we are better off without each other, but there were some great times between us and those are the times I long for. I don't miss the last couple of months, but I miss all that was before and I don't understand: where did we go wrong? One day I did get over the fact that I lost that shoe (probably right after the holiday season) so one day I will get over the fact that we lost everything that was good between us (hopefully it's that quick :p)."

You recognize that today is another day not only to love yourself but to be your best self and that the wrongdoings of your past must be left in your past. No matter who you are, no matter the changes you want and have yet to institute, you are the one and unique you and that is something not only to take gratitude in this thanksgiving but to rejoice in."

I'm a freshman and am scared as shit about Greek life and being hazed. Half the battle is that there's such an overwhelming pressure to join a fraternity/sorority to augment your social life, and everyone seems to be in a rat race to prove how ""in the loop"" they are to the whole process. The other half is realizing what you actually could be getting into, and reading about some of the hazing you'd never know about before rushing one of these organizations has kept me up at night in fear of a psychologically grueling experience."

So I'm a TA for this class. And I'm not a timid or shy person; I always ask people how they're 
doing, say hi, etc. 

I've always felt weird about this prof who I TA for.  I'm not sure if its something just in my head, but I've always felt she treated me differently. like for example I've always noticed that she'll walk around the class, and always talks to the other TAs (who are white), and ask how their weekend was, or what plans they've got. When she walks by me, she rarely acknowledges me. It's really strange. I don't know what to make of this, and i feel like I'm like getting pushed into self perpetuating some stereotype about submissive and easily ignored Asians. 

Anyway, everything else besides the weirdly being ignored part was fine until today. Today they just had to take a prelim, and I have been so swamped with work, that I hadn't had time to finish some grading. there's like 3-4 files to grade per student each week (which is a ton, its awful). I did finish the grading the night before the prelim, but without her noticing on Blackboard. She sends me this very angry email. 

Ok, thats fine. I understand, I should have graded it earlier. During class, we talk and she basically says she's not happy with me. That's whatever, fine too. Then the other TA comes in, sits down and she purposefully turns around, completely blocking me off, to whisper to the other TA about the exam and what students were asking while I stood right behind her. Clearly she was actively making a point of excluding me or something, like hello I am also one of your TAs. Is this some type of retaliation/punishment for the grading issue? I didn't really know what to do - she kept whispering to the other TA while I just stood there, so i just walked away. 

Does this seem weird to anyone else?"

Over three years ago I submitted a confession thanking a TCAT bus driver for waiting up for me instead of driving away. The reason is that I ended up dating someone I met on that bus and things looked promising. Someone commented that if things end badly, I'd be pissed at the bus driver.

That person and I ended up dating for three years. They were the love of my life. Our relationship sadly ended on bad terms. I'm still grateful for what the bus driver did, though."

For me, Cornell isn't that academically difficult, but the thing that ruins this school is the people. The majority of people here that I am around really do not know how to deal with a friend who is depressed. Giving somebody the option of just leaving a group of friends they have spent month in is not helpful at all, it just makes a person feel hopeless. I understand that not all people are made to be friends, but is it that hard to be a kind and respectful person? It seems like the only times my so-called friends care that I exist is when they think I am going to hurt myself. Other than that I feel like I don't exist."

Is there any social justice group on campus that does work other than self-advocacy? I'm really interested in getting involved, but I have yet to find any of the kind of groups I'm looking for. I'm hoping to find a group working with rights in developing countries. Specifically, I'm really interested right now in access to feminine hygiene products. It seems mundane, but there's a real problem that girls can't go to school in rural areas because they're spending one week out every month bleeding from their body. It's unsanitary, and they aren't able to go to school. In some places, it's by far one of the biggest barriers to development and equality for women. It doesn't require any significant paradigm shift to solve, women just need access to reusable pads. That's the kind of movement I want to be involved in.

Is there any group like that on campus? Not necessarily for feminine hygiene, but for developing countries."

I can't stop thinking about you. Ever since I broke up woth you you're the only person on my mind. I wish we could have ran away from this school and got married when we had the chance.

Just ask her out (or him).  Send her a message.  Mention hanging out next time you see her.  It's super simple, and you should do it because why not?  If you don't do it, you'll always wonder ""what if?""  If you do do it, there'll be no wondering and potentially a lot of good memories :)  Chances are that she'll say yes, since she's shown signs of interest.  And if she says no, no is just a two letter word.  Move on knowing what you now know!"

It has been one year since our break up and I honestly never thought I would be where I am today. I often think about the fact that I spent 1/6 of my life with you, which is crazy! I spent nights crying over you. I spent mornings crying over you. I even went to EARs and spent two hours crying to a stranger about how much I missed you. I haven't talked to you or seen you since that cold Friday night in November and at some point over the summer, I stopped wanting to see you or talk to you. I am so grateful for the year of lessons that this heartbreak has taught me. I have matured in ways that I never thought were possible and learned to step out of my comfort zone over and over again. When I was ready, I entered another romantic relationship. It didn't pan out the way I wanted to but our break up has taught me that life goes on. This time last year, I starved myself for two weeks and I contemplated jumping every other day. A year later, I am the happiest I have ever been in my life. Yes, I have bad days and things don't always go the way that I want them to, but I am happy and in love with my life and in love with all of my decisions. It's a wonderful feeling to think about how far I've come in just twelve months."

I don't know why I'm here anymore. What's the point? I used to be the ""smart"" one, a good student, a social person. Here, I have friends, but more often then not I can't see them because I'm studying. Last round of prelims I didn't study that much, and I got the average. This time around I studied my ass off just to end up ten points below the average for both math and science. I'd be perfectly happy with B-s on my transcript, I just really don't want to get Cs. I've worked too hard to settle for Cs. Every time I think about my GPA I end up locking myself in the bathroom and crying for an hour, only to get up because I'm wasting time I should spend studying. My professors have made it clear that they can't help me get a better grade, that all I can do is ""work harder"" and my TAs have actually made fun of me because of my bad grades.  And the sad part is, if I drop out of engineering I'll feel like even more of a failure. If I didn't have the support of my long-distance relationship to keep me going, I probably would have killed myself by now. I just keep wondering, what's the point of doing this?"

It's been a little over a year since we last parted ways, and I've had so many new experiences I wish I could tell you. Friends have come and gone, my major has changed more than a few times, and even a few girlfriends have taken your place. But as I sit in my empty dorm room on another dark, cold Sunday night, I can't help but reminisce on the pure beauty & innocence of our high school relationship.

Although I know you have moved on now and are happy, sometimes I selfishly wish you weren't. Or rather, I wish you weren't able to find another person to love so quickly, leaving me in the dust feeling unlovable. I know there are plenty of fish in the sea, but sometimes I despair that I may never experience the same beautifully visceral connection I had with you again.

I guess all I can do is keep searching."

One day early last semester, I stared at myself in the mirror for a long time. I was a bit depressed that I never had a best friend, that I never had a girlfriend, that I was not smart. Three years into college and still no one I would want to keep in touch with after college. I mean if you live with someone and you don't say hi when you see each other on campus. What are you? Acquaintances. I remember saying to myself ""Fuck this."" I was going to pull myself out of this. Fast forward 8 months and I couldn't be happier with my progress. I willed myself to get up early and work out. I disciplined myself. I wasn't fat before but I certainly didn't have a six-pack. I forced myself to study like crazy. If I under-performed on an exam, I studied like crazy and got myself the highest grade on the next one. I wasn't going to let some exam bring me down. Over the summer, at my internship, I became pretty good at this adult thing. I learned how to cook and manage my money. I also started teaching myself another language. When I got back on campus, some people said to me ""There's something different about you."" I just responded with the smile ""I'm still the same."" Little did they know that my life did a 180. Another big thing I did was accept my introverted nature. I started going out and enjoying nature more. I didn't feel bad for not having close friends. I was complete without others. Social media is a good thing and a bad thing. It sometimes makes you feel bad about not having friends. I got off of most social media sites except facebook because I still need that for group projects. I feel good. Really good. As Thanksgiving approaches, I'm thankful for all the things that happened that led to this. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't easy. There were some bad days early on but I got through with brute willpower and discipline like a champ. You might be thinking that I'm being arrogant and bragging. But, I really don't know anyone well enough to talk to them about this. So anonymously feeling good about myself is the next best thing. Also, to the people struggling, I'm not going to pretend I know your situation because frankly I don't. I wasn't in that bad of a place as some other people. I'm also not going to tell you that things get better. You can't wait for when they get better, if they do. You have to make it better. I was tired of being on the losing side of life. The anger combined with a desire to prove to myself that I can be better drove me. The reality is that you're the only one on your team and only you have the power to put your team in the winning column. My 21st birthday is in a few weeks and when I think about where I am and who I am, I can't help but feel proud of my journey. I still have a long way to go."

I'm taking a class right now where the professor is a bit on the young side, so he understands things about our post-teenage culture, like memes and random songs. However, he's also a bit of a dick, and recently I learned just how much of one he is. Some kid asked about the way the class was graded, and instead of pointing to the guy to the syllabus like any other professor would, said professor decided it would be okay to mock the student and tell him to look at the syllabus via a meme. It came across as like... ""why would you ask such a dumb question, just read the syllabus you moron"".

I mean, don't get me wrong, the kid is super annoying and I would probably do that too, but a professor should respect his students regardless of his personal views on their demeanor.  I don't think that kid did anything wrong, but the professor probably got tired of his shit. Sorry not sorry? The kid didn't seem too fazed by it, but I think I'm going to refrain from answering questions now, lest the professor mock me for giving a wrong answer or some shit. Man, what a world it is, where you can't even trust your professors to show you some respect."

It's like my brain wants to like them, because they're perfectly good people who've done nothing wrong, but my heart and gut are screaming NO. And this is purely due to the ""aura"" they give off, which is usually a combination of their overall personality and tastes. I genuinely wish I wasn't so judgmental (granted, this only happens to a small percentage of people I meet, but still significant enough). There's already so much hate in the world, and I'm unfortunately only adding to that :\ I wish a professional could analyze why I feel this way, and whether this is a normal, ""human"" instinct to have."

What happened?  I was a serious flirt in elementary school.  Me and Tom were inseperable.  I cried when Matt moved away. Jacob and I held hands in the story circle.  I'm using this confession as some serious reflection.  I'm a senior in college now, and I've never had a boyfriend.  I'm definitely attracted to guys, and have been since a young age, but something happened along the way, I think, that has made it hard for me to move forward in relationships with guys.  Maybe it's just that Mr. Right hasn't come along.  I've had the potential to have boyfriends - several guys have made their feelings for me quite clear, and I just haven't reciprocated the feels back at them.  The guys I do like either end up having girlfriends or are intimidating to me for some reason (I can't explain it; I choke up).  In any case, I keep looking for that ""feeling,"" you know, of being smitten or whatever.  Really, really liking a guy.  Maybe that doesn't come right in the beginning though.  Are you supposed to date someone and then get that feeling?  Please let me know if you can.  Maybe my standards are too high, or my perceptions of how this works are off somewhere.  
I do know that later in elementary school and in middle school having a boyfriend was seriously shunned by my dad.  I'm sure he had the best of intentions, but I really looked up to him and wanted to impress him.  It felt good saying ""NO"" when he asked if I had any boyfriends.  It felt good pretending boys had cooties and that they were gross to interact with on the playground.  I don't know if that's weird.  I don't know if that's just me blaming someone.  
I do know I long for closeness with someone.  I want someone to hold hands with, and to go on dates with, and to laugh with, and cuddle with, and to hug all the time.  I long for that feeling of excitement and happiness of just thinking about someone for whom you care about on that level - I have had that before for one person, but it obviously didn't work out.  He didn't love me back or we weren't right for each other or something.  I don't know how to go about finding that right someone.  I don't go to parties and hook up with people.  Dating apps are just strange and cause me to lose faith in humanity.  All-in-all, I'm a pretty lost gal.  I'm good at learning, but I feel like this is something that can't be taught.  Or maybe it is and I'm just looking in the wrong places.  Maybe I'm just being impatient."

There have been guys that I liked in high school and we spent so much time together, but never had an ""official relationship"". I have met some guys that I am attracted to here at Cornell, but I feel like I have no chance. I am also isolated somewhat because I am a Freshman that knows nobody from back home.

Many sophomore were nice but the freshmen grouped off into pairs immediately, and the seniors were bullied. Parties were raunchy with lots of drinking and swearing and singing songs that made fun of Harvard.
I never knew what was going on and eventually stopped showing up. When I did show up, the seniors would make me feel bad for it and I just quit.
I wish I'd never bother to join at all - big waste of time.
But I'm happy for those who found a family there, even though I sure found it elsewhere."

Honestly, I think that the protesters at the various schools are directing their efforts at the wrong people, specifically, what's going on with racial relations has little to do with schools and their administration. Save some energy and direct your anger at the perpetrators instead."

Ladies, ladies. Please! Wipe your little sprinkles off the seat. No one wants to squat over them or clean up someone else's dribble. Also, please remember to flush at all times. Cause sometimes you forget. Look behind you to make sure it all went down. Gentlemen, I've walked in on you twice now in that certain secret unisex stacks restroom. You are not the only person who knows about that haven of privacy, and that's why the lock is there. Please make use of it so you don't have to clear your throat to warn me. I'll try to remember to knock next time. 

This is all like Kindergarten 101. Why are these things an issue at an Ivy of all places? 

Oh yeah - don't forget to look up from your phone and look both ways when crossing the street. I have seen some of you not do that. I don't want you to be hurt."

To the undergrads reading this, hello! How was your day today? I hope this message finds you all well wherever you are:)

As one of the TAs on this campus, I wanted to urge you to seek help from your TAs and/or professors when you need help as soon as possible. Earlier the better. We are honest when we say we want all the students to do well. If you are not well, whether physically or psychologically, or something is preventing you from submitting assignments on time, etc., reach out to us! We were once undergrads too, and we know that life doesn't always go according to plan. If you need an extension, it never hurts to ask.

With the end of the semester around the corner, I notice that many students are stressed, with multiple deadlines and exams coming up. However, it's often the case that many of those struggling appear to be doing fine on the surface, wearing smiles on their faces, so we are caught in a bind of ""should we reach out more actively, or should we keep the student's privacy and keep distance?"" If you are uncomfortable, you do not have to share the details. But please, just reach out to us and let us know how we can help you succeed!

Come to our office hours, or email us to set up a time to chat if you cannot come to our office hours. We (at least me and the professors/TAs I work(ed) with) are here to listen and offer support. You are also welcomed to come in just to chat or talk about current events, projects in other classes, etc.! 

You can do it! 

Wishing you all a wonderful day😉

(If your TA or professor is not supportive, then I'm sorry...but know that there are those of us who genuinely care about students' well-being, and I hope you come across at least one during your semesters here at Cornell!)"

I’m a non-Asian who has been a member of an Asian cultural/performance club on campus for a while, so I’m used to sticking out. I can’t easily identify with all the cultural things/references/jokes/influences, but I’ve tried my best to adapt and learn. That being said, I’ve always had a feeling that I didn’t really belong with the group, or shouldn’t be a part of it.

While with the club, I’ve never been discriminated against (at least, not to my face,) and this feeling is not due to the attitudes other members express towards me. They’ve been accepting and I’ve made a majority of my Cornellian friends through them. Still, it just feels weird to be at events with crowds of people who probably would never have expected to see someone like me. It feels even weirder now that I’m in an elected position in the group. I often imagine it’s like seeing an iguana running with a pack of 20+ dogs, not away from them. 

Perhaps it’s just a backwards way of thinking that’s been created from living in a heavily stratified area prior to coming to Cornell, but I secretly believe that I hurt the image of the club by not being, well… Asian. I really care about this club, but now that’s led to me wondering if being a part of it is actually bad for it. Do people judge the club differently because I’m a part of it?

It’s made me question my role a lot, and I’ve never really shared this view with the other members. I feel like they would support me (I hope they would), but in doing so, brush off my concerns as ones that aren’t really valid. After all, they’ve accepted me, why wouldn’t everyone else? I wouldn’t want to get into a dispute about how they aren’t representative of everyone else in their views. I feel like that would just be bad for team spirit. 

If I could go back to freshman year, knowing what I know now, I probably would have still joined the club to learn all that I have learned and make the friends that I have made, but I probably wouldn’t have gotten so involved. I feel like it may have been better this way, for establishing group identity and strengthening group image, to have that random guy off to the side, seen occasionally, but never really heard.  

While my claims may be unwarranted, and may seem like intuition gone wrong, I still feel like I’ll have to deal with them until I graduate and can put this all behind me (which sucks, seeing how the club has a pretty strong alumni network, with past members visiting quite often given their busy schedules…). At that time, at least, I’ll have no real role in the club, and no real effect on anything.

To be clear, I haven’t been discriminated against while here at Cornell. I just feel like I either should have been, hearing all of the campus stories and current events in this country, or have already been discriminated against, just not to my face. The latter option is what scares me the most."

Just to echo #6963 & #6934 and to join in the I love BRMB craze, yet another freshman bandie confession:

Dropping by at the BRMB audition during orientation week is one of the best decision I’ve ever made.

I’ve always have some slight issues of low self-confidence and social anxiety. When I first came to Cornell, I was worried if I’m gonna make friends and where I can belong. Never have I expected to find a place in Cornell where I can feel so much love and support as I now have in band. BRMB is more than a club, it is a big family. It’s where you can go to when you had a really shitty day and just want to cry, when you are homesick and need some hugs, and when you receive such great scores in a prelim that you are desperate to tell your friends (speaking from personal experience). It’s the spirit when you are more than willing to walk 30-minutes to rehearsal when it’s 40 degree outside. To this day I can’t believe how lucky I am to be accepted in such a caring community.

Many times I find myself singing along the chimes of evening song coming from the clock tower. When we shout out during NCFS “we are the best in the ivy league,” I truly feel that I am proud of being a Cornelian, and furthermore, I am proud of being a part of the Big Red marching band. 

Thank you band. I can't possibly imagine my college life without you.

 

Also, since it’s anonymous I might as well say it lol:

I have a secret crush on a senior in my section. I wish him a bright future and I’ll really really miss him."

To the guy who posted on HONY about people not liking him for being active on Piazza and trying to help people:

I think it is great that you try to help people.  Even though others might make it seem like you're a know-it-all, at least you try to help people! People should learn to not be isolated, unhelpful assholes who don't even look at those walking by them.  

And anyone who says negative things about someone behind their back (or in your case, right in front of them in class) needs to look in a mirror and realize they aren't God's gift to creation and their judgment doesn't mean anything.

You do you."

I just realized that CMS is the coldest, most impersonal system ever designed because it severs the connection among students and between students and TAs/Professors. My complaint is that it is too streamlined and efficient, and I admit mine is a very subjective judgement and I'm sure the system exists for very good reasons. However, I still miss that time when I am in a small class (and by this I mean <200 students), I hand in my handwritten homework to my TAs and they would give back handwritten corrections and say things to you face-to-face. When getting back the homework I would discuss them with my neighbors, who also just got back their homework. If I forgot to bring my homework to class, I would just turn it in during OH, which is also a good chance to talk to people. But CMS shuts me out. I'm deeply disappointed. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying we should get rid of it or anything, but we need to think about how technology can change our lives in unexpected ways."

I just got out of an emotionally abusive relationship. It took me a while to accept it for what it is, because I never expected the person I loved so much to be the person hurting me the most.

I always thought I'd be smart enough to stop it before it got too far. But before I knew it I was manipulated and internalizing everything he said. I lost confidence and started evaluating everything I did based on how he would feel about it. I let him isolate me from the friends that he felt threatened by. I did everything he said, because he's the person who cared about me the most right?

I realized far too late that that's not love. Love isn't trying to change someone, it's not trying to get them to see the world your way. It's accepting someone for their flaws, not belittling them for their insecurities.

I wish I had seen it sooner. It's hard knowing everyone around you sees it but you. But the worst part by far is being so attached and altered that I keep wanting to go back. Because he's changed the way I think. I feel like I need him, I'm dependent on him. Because he only wanted the best for me right? I can't shake the conditioning of the past year that tells me every problem we had was all my fault.

It may take me a few months to fully detach myself, but at least I can see it for what it really was. The urge to keep going back will be hard to suppress, but it will go away. Emotional abuse is real. It doesn't leave scars, but it changes you forever. I wish I didn't have to learn that the hard way."

You're so annoying to me at work, but whenever you tease me, I can't help but smile and get these crazy butterflies in my stomach. I don't know why I am feeling this way, considering I am leaving next semester, but I want to let you know that I did have a little crush on you, totally unexpectedly. Even though the amount of time that I knew you was short, I would like to let you know that you were a great friend of mine, and I wish you nothing but the best in life."

I didn't realize I was gay until freshman year when I read something in a class that brought up that women would feel angered/unsatisfied/negatively emotioned if they were in a relationship with a closeted gay man. Until that point, I thought I would be able to have a relationship with a woman, because I personally am repulsed by sex; I really just want the romantic aspect of a relationship except for sex to have children. But over the past four years I feel like I've realized this is less and less practical. And now I am wondering if this last year is the year I ""come out"". I've been trying to tell myself I'm not even closeted, and I'm not ashamed of being gay, but since I don't care about sex I've never discussed it and I feel like my sexual orientation is moot. But I'm still hesitant and sometimes cry about this because I want a heteroromantic relationship but I feel like I'll be judged. 

I have gotten by so long because this isn't something that I put much thought into--I don't care for the most part. But I do care when I occasionally dream about having children and what memories I'd share with them only to remind myself that this will never happen. (I know adoption is an option but every dream is of my own blood children.) I also begin to care when there is this guy I'm inexplicably attracted to (the only one I have ever been) and I'd like to talk to my friends about him but, again, I'm hesitant to ""come out"".

Not even sure why I posted this because I'll anonymously look over comments and ignore any suggestions. I don't think I'm ashamed of being gay. I just don't want to be gay. I just want a family."

The NRA event held by the Cornell Republicans on Monday was awesome! I acquired a free extension to my 5-year strong NRA membership and some cool gear! The free pizza was amazing too. If only the people in my field knew I was an NRA member. I'm sure they would have ostracized me from group projects and other social gatherings. Most likely my grades would also suffer if the profs knew since they are quite liberal in my field.

Schuyler House is by far the most asocial and lonely place I have ever lived at. I have moved a lot in my life, lived in shared apartments and residences etc. and I am just so shocked by how cold people who live here are. People don't say Hi on Hallways, slam the doors even at night when it is obvious that others are sleeping, just make noise in general and worst of all, don't clean up after themselves. I'm just so happy when I finally get to move out of this place, it's not the facilities that make it so hard to feel at home here, it is the people. Ignorant, egoistic and careless. I tried to be nice to people in the beginning but I'm slowly giving up because it makes me feel even more lonely when friendliness is just not returned."

Premed can be such a struggle when you messed up your first semester here and have to drag your GPA back up like a boulder over your head that's just waiting for you to mess up.

I'm not even disadvantaged in any way: I'm one of the ""ideal minority"" and whatever garbage it's called when you're a brown dude, I'm middle class, and I have the most wonderful parents anyone could ask for. I just got depressed beyond my control first semester and even though I'm much better now it's so damn frustrating that not only do med school application processes see a mention of depression as a ""sign of weakness"", but that also I have no room for mistakes anymore.

It feels like so many premeds just had the sense for what to do from the moment they entered and I'm just struggling to bear this stupid load that's been on my back since day 1 here."

What is the problem with guys! Like seriously, how do we girls even know if a guy is into us or not? For all the ""women are effing complicated"", men are even worse. I mean, one week we are kissing on a street, two weeks later making out in his apartment, then no texts for a week? Days of silence followed by a one day of texting? First he says stuff like, ""I need an excuse to see you"" or ""We should meet up"" or ""Are you around and free right now"" but when I say let's get coffee, then he doesn't have time? I'm pretty sure it's not just a booty call, cos in that case he wouldn't have asked me to see him in a public place. But what is it? It's been almost two months and I am sick and tired of this hot n' cold routine. The past four years have not exactly been idyllic years of singlehood and all I want is spend some time with the guy I like. Nothing scary or serious! Just some coffee, just some holding hands and some conversation. Am I asking for too much? Am I being some ""crazy"" woman here? Ugh, I wish I knew what was going on in his head. Or I wish I had the guts to just ask him outright :-("

In response to #6948, I thought your confession about frats was extremely apt. Unfortunately I can't like it publically because I'm in a sorority and the smallest things can start drama. I suspect other people involved in Greek life agree but won't like it in order to avoid any confrontation. No one involved wants to admit it, but frats and sororities do propel a huge sense of entitlement. While I consider some of the girls in my sorority some of my best friends, I do see a lot of them going along with hookups because that's the culture. When I go to mixers, guys are very upfront about just wanting to hook up with me and nothing more and if I don't go along with it, they make it clear they will just hook up with one of my sisters. In fact when I dont go along with it, they flirt/go upstairs with other people right in front of me. It's actually pretty degrading. Also when I go to date nights/formals, guys expect me to hook up with them. Shortly after meeting a guy and going on his date night, he pulled out a condom and was shocked I wasn't going to have sex with him; his sense of entitlement was clear. Like the OP said, some frats are OKAY, just as some frat boys are. But I saw my ex get reeled into frat culture when we were dating and it was pretty sad to watch a good guy lose his original thinking and succumb to the expectations of frat life. Dating is hard within Greek life. Though not impossible, highly improbable."

 I have yet to date another Cornellian. I'm attractive, ambitious, and treat those around me with respect (sometimes not, I'm not perfect). Yet, something about me (maybe, maybe not) keeps others away. I sense it in myself. Recently, a friend of mine even questioned my sexuality, but I like men, I always have.
      The truth is I never got over you. I still remember the last time we spoke in high school. Now, whenever I think I'm crushing on another guy, something in me hesitates, pulls back, because deep down inside I haven't let you go. Baby, you are the last thing on my mind before each night's sleep. Being here, in Ithaca, is a special kind of hell, because it means we're a thousand miles apart. 
   Honestly, I'm tired of being alone, singledom bores me. Last I've heard you're playing college basketball back home. During break, when I see you next, I'll let you know my true feelings, either I put put this behind me or we move forward."

To the author of #6934:
I, too, feel the same way about joining the Big Red Marching Band.  It was truly the best decision I've made my entire semester.  Had I not joined the band, I don't think I would have made it through the semester without a mental breakdown (because I wouldn't have had such an amazing group of friends).  It'll be a sad moment as the season ends after this weekend's Penn (sucks) trip, but at least I know I will have friends to talk to next semester.  Conversely, it will be nice to have — you know, bandies — a few extra hours each week for prelim-studying and paper-writing next term.  I look forward to the next 3 years in the BRMB and meeting the classes of freshmen that come with that."

When half of your friends just want to party and the other half spends all their time with their lovers. When you feel like you've spoken only about 500 words this week and half of those were ""Hi, how are you? I'm good thanks. See you later."" When you have offer your friendship to someone you thought you were hitting it off with only to be rejected again and again in the subtlest of ways.

what's with cornell students being so secretly envious of the other ivies? No, I'm not some hostile columbia student, but seriously, why can't I even mention harvard in a conversation without people here jumping down my throat about how we're academically ""on par"" with them because of the whole Ivy League moniker. It's like there's some sinister groupthink that enforces this heavy delusion on us, and that all of this shit is due to some inferiority complex that plagues everyone here. Like, why can't you admit that you weren't good enough when you were applying to college? I, for one, am totally open about not getting into Yale or Columbia, my top two schools and instead, I willingly accept that some people are better than me, more deserving of a truly top-tier education, and ultimately, get what is justly theirs. It's saddening how we have to keep our inferiority out of sight, out of mind, and frankly, this mentality is babyish. One of my friends even told me that some drunken kids, late at night in in collegetown, nearly beat him up due to his wearing a harvard sweatshirt. Really, guys? Quit being prestige-whores and accept your place."

To paraphrase Alan Dershowitz ""They want complete freedom over their sex lives, over their personal lives, over the use of drugs, but they want mommy and daddy, dean, and president to please give them a safe place, to protect them from ideas that maybe are insensitive.""

We got to realize that we live in a bubble when we're in college, no one in the real world cares if you're overly sensitive or can't take criticism ..all that matters is if you're a good employee ..."

I'm in a frat, but I'm starting to question the morality of them. I know that mine is OKAY and that some others are OKAY, but in a general sense they just add to a shitty campus culture where students are segregated by class, race, looks... It breeds superiority and inferiority complexes, promotes an unhealthy view on human relationships- social, romantic, and professional, and it overall just has a lot of people acting like pricks. Guys go into it to get laid and binge drink, and girls go along with it primarily due to a lot of free stuff (alcohol, food), and the superiority complex (""I got invited to a formal/wine tour/whatever? I'm so much more attractive than those girls that didn't!"")"

I'm a senior with a 2.1 GPA. I'm also on academic warning, which means that if I get a C- or below, I'm permanently dismissed from Cornell. I'm pretty sure I'm close to a C in two of my classes. I live with unbearable anxiety every single day. If I fuck up and don't get my degree, all the time I've spent here ( and all of my parents money) will be for nothing. And even if I do graduate, who is going to take someone with a 2.1 GPA seriously? I'm scared. I never understood why people commit suicide, but after coming to Cornell I've started to understand why. I'm an atheist, but sometimes I pray to God so that it will all go away."

I want to let everyone with mental disorders know that it does get better, but only if you put in the concerted effort to make it better.

I was born with the nasty concoction of anxiety, depression, and self-esteem issues. I hated my life, I hated myself, and worst of all I lacked the belief that I had the ability to improve my life and my mental conditions.

But after wasting 17-18 years of my life wallowing within my own misery, something within me clicked. I was sick and tired of living life the way I was living. I was tired of my shitty existence. I decided then and there that I would put the concerted effort towards improving my mental state, improving my life.

I spent most of my free time scouring the internet, reading self-help articles, self-help books, and self-improvement books. I started meditating. After a while, I gained the courage to put what I learned and read into practice in real life. I tried talking to more people, putting myself out there more, smiling more, being more positive. It was the hardest thing I've ever done. But it started working. My negative thoughts and my lack of motivation started to evaporate. I started getting along with others. I started to love life.

I'm not nearly at the place where I want to be, but the amount of improvement I've made in the last few years is, in my opinion, insane. To my brothers and sisters who are struggling with mental disorders, I just want to let you guys know that it's possible to pick yourself up and carve out a better life for yourself. It's hard as FUCK, believe me I know. I know firsthand that misery is so, so, so comfortable. But i promise you guys that if you work hard, you have the opportunity to make it better. Love you guys, peace."

I love that you feel sadness because it means you feel. I love your ugliness, your beauty, in and out. I love your intellect, your common sense, your occasional dingy-ness. I love that you're experiencing the best and worst of Cornell and life. I love your hunger for more. I love that miss the people you love. I love that you are energetic and want to change the world.

Bernie Sanders (Congress)

My grandfather went to Cornell and met my grandmother, and he told me stories of how he used to travel by train from Ithaca to Buffalo to see Niagara Falls or to Binghamton to relax with her on either the Lehigh or the Erie trains coming into town. Today the stations are abandoned (one was transformed into a bank & the other is a Greyhound stop as my grandfather showed me on a personalized tour of Ithaca & Cornell) and I wish I could be like him. :/ Life must have been great when the Route of the Black Diamond or the Erie trains were traveling through Ithaca. Today we only have freight trains and I only hear the whistle twice a day. I wish we could have trains whistling all the time in Ithaca so that I could travel more and relax. Anyone at Cornell interested in trains? I wish we could form a club maybe with the transportation engineers and talk about train travel. Another great thing about train travel is it is long and forces you to talk to people who you would never talk to unlike the short travels we have today on buses where people text or look down on their phone and develop no social skills when they have their hands on their damn phones all the time. So many opportunities are missed and you could get a better view of the world around you if you just look up rather than looking down all the time on your phone or on the sidewalk. I see this phenomenon all the time on campus and on the buses. I don't understand why people are so afraid of each other not to look at one another."

When no one is around Sage Chapel, I love to sing ""I Know that my Redeemer Lives"" by Scott Soper and hear my voice echo across the arches: 
""I know that my Redeemer lives, the One who calls me home.
I long to see God face to face, to see with my own eyes.
I know that my Redeemer lives, that I shall rise again.
I know that I shall one day see the goodness of the Lord,
when God will wipe away our tears, and death will be no more.
The last day I shall rise again, shall be remade like God.
My home shall be by God’s own side, the dying, rising Lord.""
It makes me feel happy to visit Sage Chapel a few times a week, whenever I am depressed because I know Jesus gave up his life for me and for others so that we may live in his name. The world no longer feels big to me and I can feel safe again and that things are in order again because God will make them that way. God Bless our campus and the world so that people may hear the word of God, live in peace, and may enter the kingdom of God. I pray that I may find my soulmate one day and we could be married in God's house, and live through and spread his word."

I have to admire your skill at breaking hearts though. Now that I have some distance from yesterday - hats off to how casually cruel you were, almost unconsciously, really.

To the people who were commenting on #6866:
I just feel obligated to clarify a few things for those confused...
1.) If it is an actual service dog, the guy who posted that needs to get a grip. Allergies suck, but whatever that person is going through is worse.
2.) If this was a public place as in outside or somewhere dog friendly, that's not the owner's fault.
3.) This is the one most relevant to the discussion of emotional support animals. The laws regarding ESAs only protect the owner's right to house them in ""no pets"" housing and in some cases to transport them BY PLANE (and to bring it on a plane you have to go through a huge hassle telling the airline, giving them a doctor's note, etc.). If the dog is an ESA and not a service animal, it is not allowed in buildings that don't permit animals, and it would not be allowed on buses. The only animals allowed in these places that people may mistake for an ESA is a dog trained to calm people with PTSD, which is classified as a service dog.
I don't know the specifics of the case the poster dealt with, but those are the rules.
Source: I have an emotional support animal for my depression which has to bypass housing rules, so I have researched the topic extremely thoroughly."

I'm in an abroad program this semester. And I have gone to more classes than I ever did at Cornell and I do all my homework. It's harder. I'm making my best grades, but they still aren't good enough.

The thing is, the grades aren't reflecting it. There isn't a curve. Everytime I get a paper back it is full of corrections that I know, but just chose to omit due to the length. I realize this is on me, however, it's frustrating to see kids who never do the reading, never participate, consistently outscore me since they lack original thought in their essays. Or maybe I really am that stupid. 

Here I am, not at Cornell, making my highest grades, yet still somehow not coming up to snuff. I think I was underperforming at Cornell to protect myself from caring when I really do try."

This confession terrifies me. This confession terrifies me because I'm afraid that a boy who I have feelings for, and who (may?) have claimed to have feelings for me, will think that I'm playing games with him and give up on us as well. But for me at least that's not the case. Maybe this person isn't intentionally playing games, maybe they are confused themselves, maybe you think you've made your feelings absolutely clear but in all actuality you have not. Who knows? I hate to see people give up on love, so, if this is ""love"" like you claim it is, maybe you should have one final open and honest heart-to-heart talk with them. Maybe loves worth it. Maybe they're worth it. Or, of course, maybe not."

Abusive parents have a way of making us feel guilty.  I dealt with similar experiences growing up, and I've started talking to a CAPS counselor.  I am still dealing with the effects of the way my dad treated me growing up, and one thing I realized is that it's okay to say that he is a jerk (you could use harsher words if you wanted - I personally am not much of a swearer).  It's okay to say that out loud and to acknowledge it, and it actually feels good doing that.  And it's okay to focus on yourself and not feel bad about doing that.  I think I know your conflicted feelings - you love your dad and appreciate the good sides of him, but the bad sides are really bad and make you want to avoid him.  I've been there, and I'm thankful that I've been able to grow a little away from my own dad while at Cornell.  I'm realizing that I am a real person with valid feelings, and if he doesn't acknowledge how I tell him how he makes me feel, then it's okay that I don't want to spend time with him.  We are young and figuring out our own lives for ourselves - our parents had their chance to do that; now it's our turn.  It's super easy to set up a CAPS appointment.  Even if you can't get one right away, I would sign up for one and go to it."

Just a reminder for all of the girls out there in STEM: having ""self-confidence"" is different from having a huge superiority complex and being an asshole (i.e. saying your major is better than others). I really don't think most guys think that this is a good quality, regardless of the boy's major. I get that you don't *just* say stupid stuff regarding this topic to impress guys (duh), but it's really not a desirable quality. You're turning a lot of people off. And not just guys either.

This place has changed me a lot. I am counting down the days to graduation. If not for my parents, I wouldn't even go to graduation. I'm trying to forget about this place as soon as possible. The day after I graduate I will cut ties with anyone I knew here. This place taught me that no matter how hard I work I always suck. I kept on waiting for the hard work to pay off and you know what? It didn't. I don't have a job lined up and will graduate without one. I wish I had gone to my state school every day, but you have to live with your mistakes I guess. If I ever have kids, I will not send them here. I wouldn't want them to suffer like I did. The only good thing about going here is that I'll graduate with only about $3000 in loans. My ""friends"" have no idea I feel this way. They will never know. I never let anyone get close to me. I tried once freshman year and it didn't turn out well. So, I surrounded myself with a barrier so thick you would never get through. I've already started to ease my way out of friendships. I know what its like to not have friends from high school, so its no big deal. The only thing that makes me smile is thinking about my life after Cornell. Living in a shitty apartment, working some job that I hate that probably has nothing to do with engineering, and coming home too tired to do anything but sleep. Maybe a dog or cat if I can afford it. At least, I'll be away from Cornell.  Future students, you have been warned. Other Cornell students might not agree with me and that's okay. Everybody has their own opinions. But, it's better that you hear both sides of the story and not get caught up in the prestige and name. Ultimately, it's all up to you and you have to live with your decisions and that's not easy. Take it from a guy who regrets his decision every second of his miserable life."

I thought I really liked women (as a guys), was sort of a male feminist due to my mother, and was actually kind of a homophobe, but my experiences this year and a few very recently have made me feel a very strong disgust towards women...I just can't imagine spending any part of my life with a bitch, who is self-obsessed, ungrateful, and unclear in her communications (being passive-aggressive). Even though the idea of having sex with a man used to sound disgusting to me, I think its psychologically better for me to date a guy - the guy won't have all the feminine issues, would think like me, and be clear in communication.

This is just a rant. I, at this point, hate girls, and am reconsidering my sexual preferences."

I keep getting mood swings and have trouble concentrating on my studies up here. Example: I can only read ~5-10 pages of my genetics textbook per hour when I'm performing at top speed. Each time I catch my thoughts wandering and keep moving through these feelings of invincibility and elation to rock-bottom depression all within the course of a few hours. I just can't seem to find a happy medium where I'm calm and focused. I'm thinking of getting myself tested for bipolar or ADHD, but until then I have no idea what to do. I can't deal with this stress. If anyone's gone through this before, do you have any suggestions besides drugs?"

I'm confused about the MillionStudentMarch... The demands are so mindblowingly dumb that I’m not sure if this is supposed to raise awareness for the fact that students are in debt or if it's something like make huge demands so that they meet you half way. I'm blown away that people actually believe in these demands. If you know any economics then you would know that these demands are insane. The movement might as well be called: “let us go to school for free and pay us while you’re at it and oh, also take a hit in your endowment by divesting.” 

I know you'll bring up Scandinavian countries that provide free education but let us not forget their insane tax rates."

Anyone who watched the Yale students surround and berate Nicholas Christakis see the students throwing things similar to temper tantrums? ""When it hurts ME! It's all about ME!"". Especially that girl who screamed obscenities at him at the end (ironically she was part of the committee that hired him!); that was disgusting and despicable. I think the Mizzouri U students deserve commendations for what they did to combat racism and systematic ignorance of their problems for so long, but I think the Yale students are being little privileged dickwads who can't stand anything unpleasant at all. People really have double standards when it comes to racism, because it seems okay to many of the activists to call the black students who don't really agree with them ""Uncle Toms"". Why is that okay?

And spitting, jeering, and harassing the students who attended the Free Speech panel over at Yale...my god.

The sad thing is, I'm posting this on confessions because I feel like if I posted my opinions elsewhere, I'd be blasted by people trying to deride me with strawman attacks, ad hominem attacks, or otherwise just sarcastic and patronizing comments. Instead of someone considering an opposing viewpoint calmly, rationally, and if they thought I was wrong explaining it to me in a non-patronizing non-derisive manner. Too many people I know get off on insulting people with beliefs that aren't 100% progressive, and it rattles my soul.

I'm a racial minority (asian specifically) who grew up without a green card or citizenship in the US on borderline poverty level family income up until I was halfway through high school, so I really hope I don't get ad hominem'd with ""check your privilege"". I experienced racism and I hate it just as much as anyone else. But a white girl wearing a Mulan costume for halloween? I feel like you have to be REALLY sensitive to find that offensive"

I cannot help but be hateful toward certain people. Now this is not the kind of hate that actually influences my action; I just keep them at the back of my mind. When I interact with people I use a completely different train of thoughts and reasons. But when I am by myself, I feel the urge to mentally pick on random people around.Pretty sure this is a superiority complex of some kind. I have been telling myself to cut this shit, but it keeps me going in this highly competitive environment. With it, I feel obliged to prove to myself that I can justify my darker thoughts by being the best at what I work in. I fear that if I lose this drive, I have nothing else to keep me going."

I'm the kind of guy who likes to think of everything in terms of math. I like to believe that if you aggregate all the qualities of someone, you get some number. And I like to believe that this number is generally fixed (e.g. someone who is good at one thing has weaknesses in another area). That's why whenever I see someone who is amazing at something compared to myself, I instinctively feel the need to find out what they are not good at. This is terrible, I know. I can easily recognize when someone's good at something, but I feel the need to justify to myself why they aren't perfect. I apply this same analysis to myself. I like to believe that I am a strong STEM student but struggle in the liberal studies. This is why I have been content my entire life not getting perfect grades in liberal studies classes. Conversely, I have taught myself to not tolerate anything other that As in STEM classes. By following this system, I have been able to remain confident in my abilities and focus on perfecting them while not acting phony in areas I'm naturally weak in. But this system is dangerous. If I do poorly on a STEM assignment (and I assume that I haven't gained an appreciable skill in another area), I automatically assume that I am a deficient person in that my friends and colleagues and those around me have something they are consistently good at, something which defines them, while I don't. STEM defines me and without my proficiency in these subjects, I don't know who I am. I feel as though my existence is so fragile. I need to desperately find something else that I'm good at because if I happen to now do well in STEM, then I honestly don't know what kind of person I am."

I'm a CS major, but sometimes feel like I shouldn't be.

Well, I think I possess the mental ability to learn all the stuff I need to learn, but I just don't have the time to do it unless I take 12 credits a semester or something (aka something I cannot do if I hope to graduate on time). If the average kid takes x amount of time to learn something, I take 5x amount of time to pick up a working knowledge of the same subject. It's hard to focus on the actual learning when I feel like I'm perpetually running a race that I'm losing. 

And for those who say that learning is a journey and not a race or whatever, when your grades are set by being compared to everyone else's grades, it is a fucking race. There's no time for me to stop and smell the roses and appreciate being here. 

I know there are a lot of resources like office hours and stuff, and believe me, I go and ask questions. But my understanding is so far behind that of the average student, and there's literally zero time to bridge that gap because of the nonstop onslaught of things that I need to get done. As a result, getting a project done basically involves crying to some TA or a friend in the class until he/she relents and feeds me small parts of the answers. 

This makes me feel really fucking gross. Why can't I ever experience the process of figuring stuff out by myself? I guess I could, but I'd turn in everything late then. Or I can continue doing what I do now AKA whoring myself out for answers because of 73489204789748932074983743 impending deadlines.  

I like the subject, I really do. CS involves some really cool stuff. But how on earth can I ever enjoy it if I'm always struggling like this? I feel like the only solution to this problem is go back by like five years and start learning what I need to learn now all the way back then. Of course, that's out of the picture. 

I don't know, maybe I just need to study harder. Study more. Sleep less. Socialize less. Work while eating and eat while working.  But there's only so much of all that you can do without totally reaching the point of mental breakdown.  

I used to think I was unbreakable, but this place is pretty close to breaking me."

My father punched me on the face when I was 14 years old, almost breaking my nose. He used to hit me when I was a kid too, but because of my culture, everyone justified what he did as ""Oh, our parents used to do that to us too, and now look at how we ended up!"". But I didn't like it. It always hurt really badly, and I don't appreciate being hit/touched by an older man. I don't think it ever made me a better person, and although he hasn't hit me since (he has come close to it sometimes when I'm at home on top of screaming at me, or when I had to defend my sibling who he was about to hit once) I'm still very much afraid and angry at him. He's making me feel guilty for not being a good daughter that cares about him. I do care about him a lot. Honestly I don't want anything to do with him now though, and I don't know who to turn to. I don't want another person to tell me to forgive him just because he's my father, because part of me is done with that. Then again, I don't want to leave my father either.

To combat all the depressing posts about Cornell, I just wanted to say how incredibly grateful I am for the professors that teach my classes. For the first time in my life, I have felt so emotionally invested in a lecture that I was nearly moved to tears (for all good reasons!). I can confidently say that a single professor has made me feel intellectually curious and eternally grateful for my place in this institution. Sure, classes can be extremely hard and confidence-busting, and I tend to have breakdowns when I realize how much I need to do in my years here, but I know that all the learning that I will be doing is forever worth it.  To all the newbies reading not so happy confessions--Cornell can help you cultivate your intellectual self as long as you are open to receive all it has to offer."

I have a legitimate question. I don't want to offend anybody, I am just honestly confused. First off, I am a white male. I know that minorities face many challenges that I can not even understand. However, I am unsure of how I can best support and help reduce those challenges and create a more inclusive society. I have been told off for not doing xyz (posting in solidarity on FB, attending demonstrations, etc), but I have also been told off for doing those things (""you can't understand what we face, don't pretend you can"" etc). What is the best why I can help? Even the recent issue with the Black Students United at Cornell. They don't want a scheduled protest to occur because of the ""lack of people of color"" involve in the planning. On one hand, I understand that, but at the same time I don't. What do they want the ""majority"" to do? participate? or stand back? or occupy some middle ground of copious FB posts in empathy but no actually action. I really want to help support my fellow Cornellians and fellow human beings around the world, I just don't know how without offending anybody."

Just a reminder for all of the guys out there in STEM: having ""self-confidence"" is different from having a huge superiority complex and being an asshole (i.e. saying your major is better than others). I really don't think most girls think that this is a good quality, regardless of the girl's major. I get that you don't *just* say stupid stuff regarding this topic to impress girls (duh), but it's really not a desirable quality. You're turning a lot of people off. And not just girls either.

I am in a frat even though I cannot really afford it. When I joined, it was all colors and beauty and I liked all of the brothers and enjoyed doing all the activities I did with them as a pledge. It was good for me because I literally had no friends to hang out with so they were there whenever I needed them. However, after I started paying dues, roughly $3k a semester, I got a taste of what they really do with the money we pay and I feel I'm not really getting my money back worth of stuff. 

I have been just in a bad mood lately because of that. I didn't enjoy my summer at all, saved every penny I earned and used some of my financial aid to pay for the dues and I have been working a lot of hours per week during the semester to pay for rent and other bills. I don't know what to do. I am not happy in it. If I was getting my money worth of something for me, I'd not be complaining about it but it's hard to pay that amount of money just for a couple of beers every other weekend and hangout with my brothers.

I don't want to quit because then I'd be alone and have 20+ guys and people around them hating me for that but I really cannot afford it without working so much and saving every penny I earn. Like, I don't go out with other friends, or buy clothes or a new pair of shoes that I'd need because of that. I know I got myself to this but I don't know what to do either. Don't get me wrong, I have had a good time many times with them but I just don't feel it's worth $6k worth of hard work a year to pay for what it takes to be part of a frat.

I cannot talk to  any of my frat brothers about it because they won't understand me (since they are all rich) and some of them are shitty enough to tell me ""why did you join then?"". I really don't know what to do."

Let me first start by saying that I do not choose to be ""the special snowflake"". My existence is actually very lonely.

I grew up feeling alienated from other kids because I always felt like I was too ""smart"" and I couldn't relate to them. I feel like I am just wired that way, you know? In fact, the last time I checked my IQ, it was actually 138. I am an over thinker and I love to talk about ideas and science. While I like to go to parties to have fun with drunk people, the only people I can be ""friends"" with are those who I can have deep conversations with. 
This is why I worked my ass off to get into an ivy because I thought I could finally feel at ""home"". And I did. It was amazing. Now that I've graduated from Cornell, I'm back to feeling like an alien again. My brain wiring makes me feel like everyone is so...superficial, and I have really tried to relate to them, but I just can't. What should I do? I'm really considering doing PhD in the future to feel ""home"" again."

The vermin college students and other radicals at the University of Missouri attacked the poor president who had not one thing to do with the racist events that occurred at the university. It's funny how everyone always attacks the top person in power, even if they had not one thing to do with what happened. Unfortunately managers of any institution take the blame for any shit that happens in their organization. If we had a sane nation that would take these protesters and paddle them really well for their disrespect we would have a stronger men and women growing up in America. Without a good whippin', we have rebellious college students who are fucking pussies who don't take any blame themselves for their actions, but shoot off their mouth at others along with blaming things off at others. This sort of protesting style goes up all the way to events like Occupy Wallstreet with the street rats protesting. What they need is Jesus in their life and a good paddlin' when they were young to become constructive members of society who want to make America great again without burning and looting."

Gay guy here, (not trolling) I don't understand the crazy passion and anger that went into the rights for gay marriage. Sure it's a nice thing, but at the end of the day, it's a meaningless ceremony that started as a religious one. We don't live in some Bob Ross world where everyone is a happy little person with equal rights, sometimes you get the butt-end of the stick and you just deal. I don't understand why any gay person would want to be associated with a religious ceremony that scrutinizes homosexuality. People need to chill. Also fuck those SJW shitters at Yale.

I think ""netflix and chill"" is a funny term that we have added to our lingo, but hear me out on this: does it all contribute to what some people consider ""rape culture?"" I know ""netflix and chill"" is now a very well-known innuendo for engaging in sexual activity, and if you consent to ""netflix and chill,"" you imply your consent for all other unspecified activities... but actually that's now how it works, or rather, that's not how it should work. I think it's possible that the popularity of this term represents a very subtle, mostly harmless (if an aspect of rape culture can be considered so) way we have let the idea of consenting to one thing that usually leads to sex become a substitute for actually consenting to sex. I don't imagine that I will be raped next time I consent to ""netflix and chill,"" but I think it is in the same line of assuming that someone will have sex with you if you walk them home from a party, plan to study really late in their room, or crash at their place. This will probably get a lot of hate from people who enjoy using this comical term, and I expect that, but please consider the underlying connotations with this very popular innuendo."

I'm having a very hard time here. I have no idea who I am or what I want to do. I have lots of personal and mental problems that make it hard for me to socialize and make friends. I only have three or four friends and then a few very minor acquaintances and I don't feel very close to or fulfilled by them. I don't feel like I'm a good friend and I don't know how to become one either. I have no self esteem or motivation, I'm falling behind and I don't know how much longer I can continue on like this. I tried to talk to CAPS but I don't know how to explain my situation and it feels a little narcissistic to just pay someone to listen to me talk about myself(although, logically, I know its not narcissistic to seek help). I feel like I should be able to fix this by myself."

I miss my girlfriend who happens to have the most amazing blue eyes anyone has ever seen. They are like the color of a deep clear blue tropical oasis pool. I'm currently in Chicago after having to spend a few weeks on business doing work for a subsidiary of a company I work for in New York. I miss her so much since she's back in New York. I imagine the trip back home in 2 weeks each night before I fall back asleep. I am sitting there in a Pullman dining car having dinner and then falling asleep in my sleeper. When I wake up the next morning we are almost pulling into NYC. As we pull into New York, I know my girl is waiting up in the grand concourse for me and soon I can tell her what I have to say: That I love you, love you, pretty blue eyes. Yeah we both love the song ""Pretty Blue Eyes"" by Steve Lawrence and that's playing in the concourse too and we kiss in front of everyone because we can finally see each other after all these weeks of being separated. Call me crazy, but I love my girl."

We communicated, we hooked up, and then all of a sudden you texted me saying you weren't interested anymore. 

We started texting a couple of days ago. Then you texted me asking to come to your place for Netflix. I was excited to get to see you again, as I hope you were to see me again.

But then something happened: you cancelled on me again. For a second time. You have the right to make whatever decisions you want about where you want us to go from here, but you owe it to me to have consistent communication and to not juggle me around as if I were dispensable. 

I would like to see you again, one more time, for old times' sake. If you want to as well, then text me; you know who you are. If you don't, then just text me letting me know, and we never have to play this game again. I'll get the text and I won't respond."

My advice to any of you who are doing poorly in school and have a lot on your plate--go seek help now. Don't be like me.

I like the quote ""Great men are forged in fire. It is the privilege of lesser men to light the flame."" I know it's a Doctor Who reference and this post will probably be cheesy, but even still, I think that it's an optimistic way to view the pressures of Cornell, the pressures of life. 
Maybe I'm one of the great men, hunkering down and growing stronger against the pressures of Cornell, of my life leading up to it, of my life after it. 
Maybe not. 
Maybe I'm one of the men lighting the flame, adding to the competitive pressures of Cornell and real life. 
Either way, I'm going to fight with all my strength. Either I'll be pushed to greatness or I'll push someone else. Either way, I'll be in the fight. And I won't give up easily."

I'm such a loser. My GPA at Cornell fell from a 3.3 freshman year engineering to a horrendous low and I was forced to take a leave of absence my senior year. Because I started off ok, no one really cared to look at my grades until the end. I was so stupid that I really thought I could turn my life around that I never looked to get help. I was just too scared to go and meet with therapists and counselors. I still am. I must be one of the few engineers whose grades actually fell progressively through the years. I look around me at all of my friends and even kids from high school that graduated already and they're all doing so well. Many will be making high salaries in exciting career fields or going to prestigious graduate school programs--even the ones who were far below me academically. I fucking hate what I've done to myself. I want to get help, but from where? My overbearing and high strung parents who will probably disown me once they find out I haven't been going to school? My overachieving little brother who has a tougher major than me and is doing very well? The worst thing is...being a member in a minority Asian ethnicity makes this whole situation 10 times worse. The whole ~1,000,000 strong community is tight-knit and news travels fast. When they find out I'm not going to school and that I'm a basket case, they'll all look at me disapprovingly and pat their prestigious-college attending, highly successful children on the backs and thank God that they didn't fuck up like me."

Of all the things I think about people judging me for whenever I step outside of my dorm room, I now have to add to that list the thought of people thinking I'm a disgusting human being when I walk barefoot to the kitchen three doors down the hall to get some water. 

I think it’s reasonable to argue that at Cornell you will encounter more germs on door handles and classroom desks and chairs than you will encounter bacteria on communal floors. And the people such as yourself who are deeply concerned with this particular aspect of hygiene and the incredibly small potential for foot fungus will be wearing shoes to reduce their exposure even further. But you don’t hear sh** about the prevalence of microbes and foot problems on campus. You hear a lot more about the flu and the cold, and you’re being exposed to those viruses every day when you share classrooms and educational spaces with a countless number of other students. And those illnesses, unlike your common foot ailment, have the potential to completely keep you from fulfilling your responsibilities and coursework for a week or more. But despite the huuuge costs of airborne illnesses, most of us don’t turn our noses at people for not using purell on every doorknob, we don’t call them disgusting for placing their bare hands on top of the desks. 

So if someone walking barefoot is not going to negatively impact your own health, why be bothered? Feelings of disgust towards things like bare feet are motivated more by cultural norms than they are by a rational cost-benefit analysis. Even if you have a visceral and upsetting emotional response, it's pretty easy to avoid looking at someone’s feet anyway. Try looking them in the eye instead, strike up a conversation maybe, and have an emotionally rewarding experience as opposed to passing inane judgement. Unquantifiable disgust like this crops up among people arguing against gender neutral bathrooms. Disgust like this has also informed arguments against public displays of affection among non-heterosexual and inter-racial couples. It’s better for the people around you, as well as better for yourself as a human being, to think critically about what things you find gross and why you feel that way. Try not to close off your mind, even when it comes to something as simple as feet."

I hooked up with a Cornell professor who gave me herpes. I know it is him because he was the only person I hooked up with in a long time, and I instantly got signs of the outbreak 2 days later. This came up as a big shock to me, because I am always very careful, and never expected something like this. I don't know if he knew he was having an outbreak or not, but I do remember he mentioned he wasn't feeling too well a few days before we hooked up, and then said he was fine. He also gave me a lot of alcohol and wanted to have sex with me but when I strongly refused, he didn't push forward although he showed signs that he was clearly pissed. I told him not to take it personally because I don't have sex with people before I am in a relationship with them. He said that I will never find a gay boyfriend if I don't have sex with guys before I am in a relationship with them because ""that is just how gay guys are.""

When I told him he gave me herpes, he said herpes is super common and that I should be bothered by my weak immune system instead, because I wouldn't have gotten an outbreak had my immune system been strong. He did keep in touch for a few days and then stopped communication. 

I don't blame him, because I can't be sure he knew, but I still believe he should have been more apologetic and also should have agreed to get tested when I told him to do so in order to prevent transmitting the infection to other people (he said he doesn't know if it's him who gave me herpes and don't think it's an issue). I felt very vulnerable and ashamed of myself for months following this. I am better now, and never go unprotected even for 30 seconds of oral sex, because you never know. Protect yourself guys - oral sex has a lot of risks too."

I feel sexually repressed.

I say this because it seems as though everyone around me is having sexual experiences, and I can't focus on my work or social life without the burden of having to find some sexual partner (a girl) to have some fun with. I do not objectify women, but view sexuality and companionship as something that allows me to focus to my greatest potential. There is nothing quite like the warm embrace of a caring woman at my side.

I have also never had sex in my life. It is frustrating to have sporadic make outs occur once every two months at best, and yet never have sex. It is a thought that consumes me; a barrier that I feel needs to be broken down sooner rather than later. I need to have sex, soon. Otherwise, I fear I may break down, and that's not healthy.

In short, I know it's not right for me to have this thirst for sexuality, yet I cannot find myself able to focus unless I am engaged in sexuality. All I ask for is to have sex, one time, and then I'll be much better. For now, I'll continue to have this never ending desire to have it, and it will consume me to the core."

My roommate is an engineer and is constantly working on homework/labs/problems sets, which I understand and am very impressed with. What I find issue with is how she looks down on my work because I'm a humanities major. I get that engineering is hard, but humanity majors have to read upwards of 300 pages of difficult reading a week AND put it into context with their lectures, planning all the while for the essay they know is coming. I hate that she mentions often the lack of prelims in my life, but I write papers almost every week. The one time I brought up my opinions she didn't talk to me for a week, which scares me because I don't want to end up living in a hellish nightmare of a room.

Hi Friend,

I feel this confession big time. You might get some comments in disagreement, but I would honestly say it's possible. Just use discretion. If you're honest without being overbearing and this person is worth your time, he'll at least respond. He might even appreciate the courage and spontaneity! From there, how you navigate that conversation will determine whether or not you can mitigate any lingering suspicion or awkwardness. Starting non-intrusively and casually, with a VERY brief message, shouldn't scare him away or weird him out to the point of completely ignoring you. If it does, he might be a bit of an asshole.

I've done the whole message thing and had success, and it's always best if you have a reason to want to talk to them. What is your relationship with this guy? Do you have overlapping social circles/interests on campus? Have you been in groups or classes together but never had a one-on-one interaction or exchanged words? Is there any other way you might be able to get in touch with him via a more in-person medium, an event, or a mutual friend? These are all things to consider, because I've also had some pretty memorable failures, but I'd need more context to really give you an informed suggestion. You're definitely not worse than me; I'm almost sure of it. All in the presentation! :)

Sincerely,
The most socially inept guy on the planet"

I had a mental breakdown on Friday. I had a big fight with my closest friend the day before and I got pulled over on Tower road across from Uris Hall for riding through a red light - on my BIKE!! Can you believe the bullshittery and nitpickiness of the Cornell police? I can't. Anyway, the cop took my drivers licence and went back to write up a ticket for me. Thinking about my bad luck and fight with my friend, I started crying. Then, I forwent the crying and went straight to screaming. I think everyone on central heard me because a guest staying at the Statler hotel came out and asked what was going on and how everyone in the hotel could hear me. It got so loud that several vehicles on either side and several, several pedestrians stopped and stared. I never felt both so alone and so surrounded by people at the same time. The cop actually had to call for two backups. TWO. My voice still hasn't recovered. Two of my friends who were walking past stopped and helped me when they recognized the person screaming their head off was me. I love them so much for doing that. I know several 'friends' of mine who wouldn't give a shit and would continue walking, acting as if they didn't know me so it means a lot that they stopped and cared. Don't bottle up your emotions. Evaluate your friendships. It's always revealing to see who stays and loves you still after you completely break down."

I'm a scumbag. Well, maybe that's a little harsh, but I'm not the nice guy girls tell me I am. When I first came to Cornell, I most certainly was the nice guy, the guy who complained about the ""friend-zone"" (spoiler alert: it doesn't exist). As soon as it was possible, I entered a relationship with a very sweet, nice girl. She was very into me, and I was thrilled to have someone who liked me for once. This was all well and good for about a month, until I realized I didn't like her, I just liked the idea of her. Trying to be fair, I broke it off. I tried again, but realized I had done the same thing to an equally sweet girl who didn't deserve to have to deal with me. I realized all the things I was doing wrong, my misgivings about what love/relationships meant. I stayed away from the dating game for a while, focusing on actually being friends with a girl for once. I still felt empty. I got better at conversations, saying the right things at the right points, stopped being ""weird"" in public. Acne cleared up, cleaned up my wardrobe, and realized I could hookup with girls, almost no strings attached. So I did. I tried to fill the void with meaningless sex, constantly lying, saying anything to get with these girls because I selfishly thought that would make me happy. Don't get me wrong now, these girls were almost certainly using me as well. I'm booty-called more often than I booty-call. Consent is sexy, folks. Now, I look at myself, constantly shifting between different girls to hookup with, and I'm still not happy. I thought I believed in love. I thought sex would fulfill something in me. I thought I was living the college male's dream. Casual sex, no strings, no drama, no bullshit. I don't know what I want, and I don't know if I'll be able to be happy. I'm not sure what I'm trying to say here, but all I know is, I can't seem to make myself happy. And that terrifies me. I'm not looking for sympathy, I just need to say these things, ya know?

I am appalled by the recent protests at Yale, which are calling for professors to resign because of their opinions of cultural appropriation on Halloween. Cultural appropriation is an issue worth discussing, but it's embarrassing that students at a school as prestigious as Yale want to be sheltered from different perspectives. At Cornell, I have learned far more by talking with those I disagree with than by talking to those who share the same views. I hope our student body never becomes so arrogant as to try to silence professors who disagree with us. I am also very relieved that President Garrett spoke about the need to protect freedom of speech at Cornell."

Not being around you, makes me realize I don't need you. You're unsupportive and condescending, and it has been leeching the radiance from my soul these past years.  I wish you all the best, and I know you'll go far in your career, because work is all you seem to care about. More importantly, congratulations on being my only regret. You see, I wasted valuable time and energy as I somehow managed to latch myself onto the one person who doesn't want or need me. I'll probably never tell you because this is something that has been building up over time, it's hard to articulate. I've witnessed you do the same to others, it was only a matter of time before the same happened to me. From this point on, I'll focus my energy on my passions and anyone who can love as much as I do. Although I've never told you, you'll probably know who wrote this because deep down you know this true. You're not as kind and generous as you make yourself appear to be."

I completely bombed an interview for a job I really wanted, and I'm so embarrassed about how poorly I did. I don't know how long it's going to take me to get over this, but I feel absolutely horrible. Most of my embarrassment comes from the fact that these were ""easy"" questions catered to my areas of strength, but I was unable to give quick/polished answers because I did not have sufficient time to prepare. As expected, the rejection letter came fairly quickly. At least the interviewer and I were both on the same page with regards to that."

This is in response to the couple previous post about STEM major writing off non-STEM majors.

I'm a STEM major. I know the world needs all kinds of professionals - engineers, lawyers, hotel administrators, writers, therapists, etc. But at the same time, its frustrating when I see my friends in A&S/CALS/HumEc spending a couple hours a day in class, a couple hours on HW, and then having buckets of free time to hang out or do fun things. I feel like I never have free time. 

I am taking 20 credits this term. My flowchart has me taking 19 credits/term as an upperclassman. My flowchart. as in the minimum requirements to graduate. My friends in other schools are averaging around 14. They have to petition take 18. I have to take 19 just to graduate. Thats not even considered the fact that all credits are not equal...

I know that I choose my major. I know that all of the majors and careers are equally needed. But, yes. I am bitter that the workload is so uneven. This is what leads me to ""look down on"" other majors (which I am not proud of). It is something I am working on, it is something a lot of us need to work on. But at the same time, I hope non-STEM people can see where this is coming from."

OP of #6748 thanks for speaking up because I also dislike people who are so fucking environmentally conscious, and have to tell me how to live my life. I hated living in NY for that reason and I am so glad I live in Pennsylvania now. There is less influence from environmentalists and as a result things are more reliable, especially my electricity which is 50% cheaper than upstate NY. I don't have to waste time recycling everything to be in compliance with the law because my town does not even have curbside recycle that's mandatory. I get to pay less fuel taxes in Pennsylvania as well and don't have to worry much about environmental horse shit unless I'm in Philly maybe"

I've recently taken a leave of absence from Cornell for mental health reasons, and I already feel like nothing's ever going to get better. I haven't spoken to anyone or left the house in days, and the only conversation I've had with a Cornell student since I left has been maybe 4 messages long.

But then again, the only alternative is going back to campus, where not only am I invisible, but I also am surrounded by Cornell students who are doing actual things with their lives.

Either way, I can't seem to imagine a future where I actually matter to someone, and I can't imagine a future worth sticking around for."

I always felt like your “backup plan”.  I knew we were just friends but I was always willing to drop my plans to be there when you needed someone to study, get dinner, or even just hang out with. I thought I was okay with that. I was wrong. All the plans we made that didn’t happen, the times when I wouldn’t hear from you for days, and the unanswered messages have finally taken an emotional toll on me. I do care. Probably too much. I think I need a break from you, from us, from wondering if we would ever be something more. I’m sorry if I seem a little cold lately. Its hard for me too, but I think its my way of forcing myself to finally move on. Its probably something I should have done a long time ago. Maybe then will I stop being anyone’s backup plan."

I really shouldn't blame myself. It's okay to be alone, and being alone does not mean I am a lesser person. I shouldn't question my self-worth because I am alone, and yet, I still do.

A message to the sisterhood and beyond:
Back in high school, I had terrible, chronic episodes of self-doubt and anxiety. I'd spend hours of my time every day worrying over boys and relationships. While fretting over questions like ""Why don't boys like me???"",  ""Why doesn't he like me back???"" and ""When will I finally get a boyfriend too??"" I began to lose sight of my value independent to the admiration of boys. Getting dressed up, learning how to do makeup, and forcing myself to smile with the end goal of pleasing somebody else only made me tired and more insecure about myself. 
Then, over the summer, something clicked. After cutting off ties with the boy who exploited my insecurities and lead me on, I felt something I hadn't felt in a long time: empowered. I'd finally done myself justice. I felt a sense of independence that made me look at myself and everything around me differently. I stopped caring about unearthing the campus for a relationship or trying be ""pretty"" so boys will like me. Fuck that, every day I make sure I'm living life for me and the people who I know love me (ie family, friends, my dog Charlie) I am more confident and sure of myself than I'd ever been previously. And, as a bonus, confidence really does attract more boys than a fragile personality and cheap smile ever will! I work hard to be the woman I am today, and that pride will carry me far. Because once you know who you are and what you will not stand being defined by, the world is your stomping ground.
My one bit of advice is, to my ladies and gents who are struggling being comfortable in their own skin, to the beautiful people who sigh looking in the mirror, know that the quality of your life is completely dependent on your mindset and attitude. Building confidence is a journey. Every day literally pick yourself up to the mirror and say out loud ""I am beautiful. You are going to do great today."" It may sound foolishly simple or straight up dumb, but trust me. That's how I started to become more confident. And once you say it to a physical face, you'll start to believe it in no time. And if you feel like you ""fucked up"" today, get some sleep and try again tomorrow. Good luck!"

It bothers me when people blame Cornell for all their issues. It feels almost like if you're in college, you can blame everything on the administration being bad, or the classes being badly taught, or the environment being weird. Just because you're paying a large amount of money for it doesn't mean it's going to be perfect. Life will be hard, there will be challenges, and yes, you will doubt yourself. Of course there will be a class now and then that doesn't suit the way YOU like to learn. That's only part of the experience. We are here to learn how to survive in the real world. And in the real world, things will not always go your way - however much you want them to. You just have to deal with it."

On Tuesday, I had an absolutely wonderful conversation with a girl during an almost cinematic scene on this resplendent, infinitely spontaneous, aesthetically delirious, and vibrantly alive campus. On Wednesday, I had another one with a different girl in an equally beautiful setting. And these are just the icing on the cake. In general, I've been doing so much better with interactions, recognizing a good friendship that shouldn't be corrupted, challenging my own previous notions about romance, etc. 

Now then: I would love to stay in this world of change, good friendship, and sanity for as long as I can. I am SO glad with where I am right now. They always tell you cliches about college changing you. But my goodness, have I changed, and in so many ways. These conversations could never have happened without all of my learning moments from the past. I NEEDED to go through all of that and I couldn't possibly know where I'd be or what I'd be as an almost 21 year old without all of those frighteningly awkward and absurd mistakes from my 16-20 year old past (though really, you could go much farther back if you wanted to, but I digress.) So for that I am grateful.

 Still, I am an extremely sexual and highly romantic being at my core, and while I don't currently feel that I'm suppressing anything, I know that I'm liable to ruin one or more of these interactions soon. And even though I'm more confident and I make much better decisions now, I am afraid of dealing with the possibility of my past, oft-rejected self by making a move on one of these many great friends I have. I'm not afraid of rejection, just wary of my own imperfection, if that makes any sense. Some of these friends are quite literally VICTIMS of my poor decision-making that have come back over time, and our friendships have rekindled magically. 

I don't want to fail and slip back into my old ways or rely on terrible things like porn and fetishization and desperate social media endeavors/ill-advised, random, romantic ventures as a filthy, foolish, and angry/sad backlash to my feelings of inevitable failure. Please don't tell me to just be brave and reach out to one of the people I'm interested in--I'm still in the process of learning how to actually read signs and I don't want to rush anything.  But I also don't want to get bored and do something stupid."

I read your confession and I thought it was me writing from last week...I had 4 ten-page papers due last week and a prelim, and I ended up having to turn in one of the papers 3 days late, I thought I was completely alone, I'm on academic warning, and I might fail a class. A lot of it has to do with the fact that I have terribly low self-esteem, but that's a navel-gazing essay for another time. The point is that last week life felt impossible, and I thought I was going to fail my late paper. But this week, I got that paper back with a grade of 99, a random stranger stopped me on the sidewalk and told me he couldn't resist introducing himself because I seemed like a fascinating person, and when I reached out for help against my better judgment regarding some personal issues, some people on this campus really stepped up and helped me despite that there was no benefit for them in doing so. 

I guess what I'm saying is that things may seem terrible now, but next week might be amazing. It's easy to get so bogged down by the negative things in an environment like this, and lose sight of the positive.

Mental health issues plague this campus. Maybe you disagree with the extent, or maybe you haven't had much exposure to it, but it's mental health is an undisputable issue and part of the reason attending this school has so much stigma. We as students need to make a greater effort in our lives to make others feel more comfortable and happy at this school. It ultimately beneifts us all. I think we can all agree Cornell is a competitive, grueling, and oftentimes miserable environment. It's worsened when we aren't making an active effort in our daily lives to care for each other. It's worsened when we only care about ourselves and our own grades and neglect the people we encounter daily. It's worsened when we go through the motions of our daily routine in isolation and don't connect to the people around us in class, on campus, at home. Whether it's the people we live with, take classes with, or see when we go out, why not make a greater effort to make others feel heard and appreciated? Cornell is oftentimes a place where people think they don't have the time or energy to make emotional investments in other people. This is obvious in the hook up culture and in our classes when people are focused primarily on themselves and concerned with advancing themselves at the expense of other people. If we want to change campus culture, we have to change ourselves. Think about how many people you may know who are struggling but maybe are too afraid to ask for help or can't admit it at all. Think about all the times you didn't bother asking someone how they're doing or didn't make the effort to get to know someone beyond the surface level. Think about how many people struggle socially at this school, are completely alone, and may have a hard time making friends. Think about how on any given day, you may encounter someone who has contemplated suicide, feels worthless, and has nobody to talk to at our school. Take brief moments out of your day to be a friend to the people you encounter, even if you are busy. Make the emotional investment, even when it makes you uncomfortable. As idealistic as this sounds, it makes a huge difference to us all when people feel less isolated and connected to their peers. This school really needs a better community mindset and that begins with simple acts of kindness and caring for each other."

When I say I'm ""alone,"" I mean in a romantic sense. I have everything I could ever want, and I really shouldn't be crying over this, but I want a guy in my life to love who will love me back. I can live without him, but still. And I've actually been through several relationships, all where the guy breaks up with me in the end, and I tell myself, ""No big deal,"" and continue on my merry way. 

I know that I won't be forever alone and that people will come and go throughout my life, but it's during times like these when my confidence falters and I wonder if I'm wrong and that I'll truly be alone. I know I shouldn't judge my self-worth off of whether or not they stay with me, but sometimes I just can't help but wonder what is it about me that makes guys realize, ""Oh fuck, this girl isn't as cool as I thought she was. Big mistake. My bad. Gotta go.""

Last week, I was discussing post graduation plans with a close friend and I was incredibly disheartened by his reaction. When I told him that I accepted an offer as an investment banking analyst at a high profile firm (GS/CVP/LAZ/EVR), he proceeded to go on a long rant about how I was destroying the world and how investment banks are ""evil."" I asked him why and his answer was that banks steal from the public and don't contribute to society - which, clearly, is not what investment banks do.

This attitude is exhibited by a lot of people in the general public, but I didn't expect it from a Cornellian. People need to educate themselves about what they're judging before they formulate their opinions. Nine times out of ten, someone ranting about bankers screwing up society will not be able to tell you why they think that if you ask them why they think that. If you look at the articles about the unfortunate Moelis and Goldman suicides from this past summer, all the comments are uneducated and honestly inhumane insults proclaiming that the individuals ""deserved to die"" and ""the world is better off without them."" There's so much undeserved hatred to the industry that I don't even want to tell my relatives about my job even though it's a position that I've had to work extremely hard for and will work extremely hard in - it's something that I should be duly proud about. 

So what do bankers do? They advise companies on mergers and acquisitions by valuing the company they're representing - that's it. Analysts work incredibly hard to do this and spend upwards of a hundred hours a week at work. They have it tough enough without people who don't even understand trashing them so please be courteous and don't bad mouth an industry that you don't comprehend just because the media tells you to do it.

For the people on here to who post about depression, anxiety and etc. I just want to say that it is important for you to seek help. Seek help now before you convince yourself that you can magically ""fix"" yourself without actually changing anything in your life. There is no shame in therapy, and it can be beneficial to anyone, even if you feel that you don't have anything ""wrong"" with you.

That being said... if you are considering CAPS... you should consider it more as a first step rather than a long-lasting therapy solution.

Quite frankly, CAPs is overbooked and filled with overworked counselors (and some of whom are just plain bad and don't care) who see you as part of an overstressed tide of Cornell students. It will take you a while to get an appointment, especially if you are unlucky. Once you do meet your counselor, don't be surprised if the session is extremely impersonal and even unhelpful. I can't provide any concrete proof of this, but I have heard stories from friends of students who went to seek 'help', confessed suicidal feelings, and were forced to withdraw from Cornell for a semester.

My personal experience was not great. My counselor kept making generalizations about me based on my status as a Cornell student and my race (apparently, all of my problems stemmed from my race, ""culture"" and parents... and not me as an individual). They never asked any in-depth questions or seemed to care about getting anything but a surface understanding of my problems. I can't really blame them though, because I was probably the 1000th student they'd seen. 

The best thing you can get from Gannett CAPS is a referral to a therapist, psychologist or psychiatrist in the Ithaca area."

After reading #6717 (about being drunk, having sex and not remembering if consent was given or not)

In the confession, the person didn't remember if consent was given or not. So it opens the possibility that the person acted as if giving consent, and the guy believed that the actions were an honest expression of consent. I don't think he should be punished for that.

Honestly saying, the way the person describes the situation doesn't feel like a traumatic experience, and I feel like if it wasn't traumatic, then it shouldn't become. Sometimes we make decisions while we're drunk, and we shouldn't go after someone else simply because we regret it later. But if it was traumatic, then this person should seek help and support, and go after their legal rights, because using force/coercion to traumatize and use a person to get your sexual needs met is never acceptable."

“men act like they’re in high school” or “don’t have it together” are not sour grapes or losers’ laments; they reflect a true and growing reality.""

So, when it's women that are falling behind men by almost every measure there is, it's because society and the system and patriarchy are to blame and whatever. But when it's men that are falling behind, it's simply because men are low quality?

Seriously, it really bothers me to see so much hypocrisy in the world. What a bunch of BS."

White people need to learn how to act around minorities. Minorities spend their entire lives learning how to get along with white people, and white people dont care to learn about others at all. Like how hard is it to not want to wear black face and not use the n-word. Then they want us to be their tokens so they can ""learn"" or look good to others but those minorities just end up having to appease them more. It's crazy"

As a member of an MGLC organization it irks me to no end when a Panhell or IFC member asks why the MGLC is needed. You hear all these stories about IFC frats not wanting black girls at their parties, and panhel sororities not wanting black sisters and it's easy to see why someone of color would not want to be in those groups. While some students do not mind being the ""token"" colored person, I should not be ridiculed for not wanting to be the token, and for wanting to be around people who don't judge me on my skin color. All my classes and organizations are mostly white and I only feel comfortable around MGLC members and am thankful for its creation. MGLC and other organizations for minorities were not created because we are racist or do not want to be around white people, but because white people are racist, whether implicitly or explicitly, studies show this to be true. So do not question my involvement with the MGLC when I interact with you all on a daily basis and don't question your implicit bias against those with a darker hue."

Alright, here's the thing, people. Bernie Sanders is not actually a socialist. Socialism is defined as a socioeconomic system in which the means of production are socially owned. Thus, a socialist advocates for the transformation of the preexisting economy into one in which the workers collectively and democratically manage their own workplaces, instead of one dominated by privately-owned businesses.

What Sanders identifies as, a reformist democratic socialist, refers to someone who seeks to achieve that goal through reforms within the existing political system. But he only seeks to through reform make capitalism more regulated, not with any ultimate goal of abolishing capitalism itself.

Thus, Bernie Sanders is not actually a democratic socialist, but a social democrat. The Scandinavian countries he talks about are also social democratic, not socialist. Social democracy is a capitalist ideology that advocates for a more regulated economy and government intervention in social welfare, and it is not socialism."

I'm a Cornell alumni that graduated last year. I have been seeing a lot of negative posts about Cornell and just wanted to say this: If I could leave my home country and come back to Cornell, I would do so in the blink of an eye. It was definitely a stressful school. I was so depressed in my first year that I sought out counseling from CAPS. But guess what? The pressure that Cornell gave me and the support I got from CAPS made me a much stronger person. Cornell changed my personality, which is helping me thrive at work today. Of course, there are pros and cons to every school. But Cornell is such a big community, you would surely find people that you can click with and call them your secondary family. 

If you are feeling stressed, just remember that this is temporary. Cornell pushes you out of your comfort zone, but that's not a bad thing. Appreciate every day that you have there as there are so many of us out here who can only wish to be back to that beautiful environment. One day, this could be you :)"

I'm terrified of how sad I can get at Cornell. It's my second year here, and I've noticed such sadness here, even if it isn't obvious. Before coming to Cornell, I'd never felt such hopelessness or despair for  my grades, my social life, my future. It's difficult for me to know that even thought I study and try my best, I'll still only be either average or a slight bit above in my classes. I try so hard to keep smiling every day, but it's just getting harder. Sometimes it feels like I'm losing control of my life and it terrifies me. Cornell is a beautiful place but it can be so ugly sometimes."

To #6685:

I am sorry you have had those experiences. It is up to you to decide if, when, and how to tell (or not tell) people at Cornell about your girlfriend. You can also be selective about who you tell and not include everyone if you don't think it's in your best interest. I hope you do find some nice friends who are sympathetic to your situation and delighted you have a girlfriend, regardless of how you internally or externally identify. 

In the meantime, I would recommend seeking out resources that may be able to help you with this, such as EARS and/or the LGBT Resource Center.  Even though it may be intimidating opening up about your situation, these people should be able to provide you with support for how to best handle this. If nothing else, you're not the first person at Cornell to have dealt with something like this and I am confident you will succeed ☆."

It's frustrating that I can't be talented at anything ""practical"", like STEM, accounting, business, social networking, etc. Things that will supposedly give me a more stable life. Instead, I have the most useless **** talents that won't take me anywhere- or if they do, it will be with great risk, determination, etc. which I just don't have. Life is unfortunately biased towards the ""smarter"" STEM people. People who enjoyed building computers when they were 10 years old, and not say, painting pictures. These people have it so easy in that they get all the well-paying jobs that they ALSO happen to enjoy doing. There is a demand for their work, and I can understand why. After all, ""practical"" fields are the reason we have so many of the advancements we do today.Other talents, such as music, art, and so forth only add beauty to an otherwise black and white world. Don't get me wrong, they have their own merits too, but one really has to be extraordinary in order to make a good living with them. I guess I'm just jealous that some people are able to get jobs/internships so easily while other people like me have to struggle, or settle for being an average player in a ""practical"" field, instead of being able to do what I'm more naturally inclined towards. I just really needed to get that out of my system."

You and the original poster both speak as if all opportunities are now for minorities which is entirely untrue. There is a still a great lack of diversity in most STEM fields and the few programs you see are working against that. Most of these programs provide inexpensive experiences that women and students of color would not get simply as a result of structural racism and sexism. You're complaining about an issue that minorities have faced from the beginning time. It seems non-minorities only care about inequality when it affects them, their privilege and their success. The majority of you stay silent when students of color or women in your classroom face racism and sexism on a weekly, if not daily basis."

Cornell has increased my anxiety and depression so much to the point where I feel as if suicide would be the only suitable answer to submitting my paper 3 days late. This university has historically punished me severely for missteps like late assignments, so my own demise seems easier to face than an unforgiving professor telling me that I am going to fail his class. Not to mention, I am a senior who is already on academic warning, so if I get a low grade its over for me. Failed class=no degree=no job=no way to survive. I am lost."

I am trying to get a health leave of absence for the semester, but my biggest concern is that I will have to pay back all of the tuition I got in aid, which was around 20k for this semester.  Needless to say, I don't have 20k, so the amount I have to pay back is the biggest factor in whether I decide to go on leave or not.  

So I called up financial aid and asked this question, and the woman told me ""We can't tell you anything until we know the leave date."" Are you f******* kidding me.  Can anyone who has gone on a health leave of absence, didn't have tuition insurance, and is here on financial aid please tell me how much of it you had to pay back?  The fact that even with an overpaid and underworked army of staff here I can't have simple questions answered is supremely frustrating."

Many people say that college is about finding yourself. I have definitely found myself in these 4 years. I'm quiet and shy and depressed. I'm addicted to pain. I like it. I'm not talking about self-harming. I don't do that. I'm talking about emotional and psychological pain. I look forward to rain and cloudy weather because it makes me feel sad and I like it. I get really pissed off when its sunny. I take a lot more credits than I can handle. I don't do great in those classes. I do ok but the point is I stay busy. If I don't, I find myself getting into destructive habits like being drunk every day, smoking cigarettes, and doing drugs. When I take a lot of classes, I'm constantly doing work. I sleep 3 to 4 hours a night, don't eat, and pretty much just survive on caffeine. These habits are less destructive than the other ones so I just go with it. Plus its not like I have any friends to hang out with so doing work distracts me from all that. This past summer I worked two jobs. I don't even have that many student loans. I worked just because. I wanted a third job but my parents stopped me. I always hope that I would get into a fight with someone so they can beat me up. I want the pain. That's all life is and the sooner you accept that, the better it is. I'm scared I won't find a job where I can work 70 hrs/wk. I'm scared what will happen if I have free time in the real world. I don't even care if it pays well. I just want to work myself to death sooner rather than later. Something to escape sedate me while I live this meaningless existence. People on here are always like you should message me to talk. That's very sweet of you people but I'm too far gone. No one can do anything. And the truth is I would never be able to talk about this in person. When I think about how much this place has changed me, it really surprises me. I wasn't like this in high school. In college, all my ""friends"" drifted apart and I realized how hard it is to actually make decent friends. Soon after, I stopped trying because its really pointless. I can't wait to graduate and forget about these 4 years which probably have been the darkest of my life so far. I have promised myself to come back here at least once a year to reminisce because no matter how much I hate this place it made me into who I am today. And you can't forget what made you and who you really are."

now change conservative and change it for liberal, it is the exact same argument.

everyone now is so entitled that they think they are right on their political visions, heck even as a minority i cant be openly about being ""conservative"" because i will get attacked and discriminated by my own peers.

sometimes (not always) some ""liberals"" can be more wild that your standard conservative.

also, about being more conservative, which i assume you read in an online article i saw floating a couple of weeks ago; the people who came up with that ""measurement"" are comparing conservatives today with a more liberal benchmark, ie it makes liberals look less liberal than what they currently are, when simply conservatives have not moved much from their beliefs for years."

College itself doesn't have to be hard. There are those teachers who make it hard by giving you work prior to teaching it, and then making it count for a large percentage of your grade. That's a cheap way of making it seems like class is hard--it's not, only your way of giving work is. If teachers taught the subject first, then gave work based on it, we'd all be happy. I know that every course is accelerated because so much material must be given in the span of 3 months, but that doesn't mean a teacher has to give us, say, a problem set on crap they won't cover for another week and expect it done when we're still in the middle of the material. Great...I learn how to do every problem set after I hand it in. What a great representation of my capabilities as a student."

My wife and I graduated from Cornell but we are very traditional. We came from low income families and recieved financial aid at Cornell but we always felt like we were judged at Cornell. Today we are still just well enough off to pay our bills after graduating nearly 8 years ago. I don't donate because we feel as though we did not make it better than lower middle class. I work and my wife is a housewife because she couldn't find a good job in the area in which we live. We live in a regular trailer out in a rural area because we couldn't afford a home even after graduating Cornell. The reason my wife decided not to work is because our taxes would be higher if she did and she's a great organizer who saves money in our household by shopping wisely and saving a lot with coupons as frugal living has become necessary for us. She's also great at taking care of our trailer so we don't have to hire a cleaning lady. We figured we can live frugally and save money that way. I am just happy we can live comfortably even though we have a little bit of debt left on our student loans. After finding out what Cornell really is, I don't think I would send our kids to school here or anywhere in general because it's not worth the hard work and effort we had to put in especially if we had to pay full tuition. Our kids might be better off getting a real career as a plumber or as a skilled union laborer rather than going to school. These people make more money than most kids graduating from college these days and they have a skill sought out in the real world rather than a theoretical textbook view that most jobs could care less about. When we both graduated and started looking for jobs no one really asked us about what we knew but it's good that we both had some skills since my dad ran a business and allowed both of us to get some real world experience that helped us more than our wasteful education at Cornell. It's just a piece of paper that's worthless. I'm glad I didn't have to pay much to become a janitor."

Since everyone seems to be confession about their penis, let make take a crack at it (no pun intended). Mine is an average length but a really messed up shape. It's like a pyramid shape, really thick at the base and then it tapers off. I would kill to have a normal uniformly sized body with a slightly larger head, the way it's supposed to be. But no, it's like a triangle. It's flattened too, not cylindrical. I think that's from prone masturbation which is all I did until I was 18. Then I read how bad it can be for the penis. If anyone out there is doing that -- DON'T!. Alas, the damage has been done. I also have a lot of foreskin and it doesn't retract even when the penis is erect. So honestly, length is not all that matters at all. Having a normally shaped penis is much more important. So be thankful if you have that."

What most women don't understand is that a lot of their suffering in relationships comes from the fact that they don't really evaluate the guy's character before entering a relationship or hooking up with him. 

But for men it's different. Men suffer because they can't get into a relationship or attract a woman in the first place. And feeling unlovable/invisible is even worse. It takes a toll in the guy's self-esteem and self-confidence, pushing him into a cycle of self-abandonment that can last for years and further diminishes his ability to attract women and increases his isolation. And when society, women, family and friends tell him ""woman like a nice guy"" and ""just wait, I'm sure you'll find someone"", he follows this advice and it doesn't work. Meanwhile, he sees all the women in his life get into relationships and having sex with guys they just met and/or treat them bad. 

And he feels bad, defective and ashamed. And he might even become angry, but that's not misogyny. Misogyny is anger towards women, simply because they are women. He is angry because he feels fooled and he perceives life as being unfair. He is just a human being that's hurt. And just as women, he also has a responsibility in his suffering. Because he's not been honest, with himself or with other people, and he's choosing to keep doing the same things that doesn't work.

And for the guys who identify with this, and for the hurt guy that still lives inside me, there's only one way out: integrity and working to become your best self. Just know that you're not alone, and don't give up. You deserve to be happy too."

To the Student Assembly, Gannett Health Center, President Garrett and people who currently are in struggles: 

To be boldly honest with you guys, I love the opportunities, resource and classmates in the school. Yet, the reputation of depression hasn't been regulated a bit EVEN the school increases the fee of our health insurance. 

I have experienced family loss which result in depression and grade suffering. When I actively asked various department officials for help , they would basically said:""I would like to help you but I am actually not in charge of this issue, you may want to talk to your advisor/director/dean/professors/bursar office/ financial aid office/ Gannett etc"". Guys, Cornell is a BIG and DECENTRALIZED campus, I need to walk to different buildings and tell everyone about my circumstance again, again, again, again and again, but no one could actually speak behalf of me(I understand it's my responsibility); it drains my energy and frustrate me when they kick me back and forth like a BALL in the snow; eventually I could not find a reliable people. In the end, they would ask me sequence of doubtful questions""have you thought about commit a suicide/ Do you hate people etc."" with doubtful/anxious/pretended caring attitude. Eventually, they would ask students to take the health leave in order to protect the school reputation, because if you make any troubles outside of the campus, that would not be their responsibilities since the school official and Gannett ask you to leave. (*Please don't misunderstand me, I am not saying health leave is a bad idea in some situation) Eventually, it's like an infinite loop, the depression in the school will never be regulated effectively.

I stay positive, but I need your help to be vitalized; I need your actual support and advice while studying in the school with depression then gradually come out of the struggle. A setback is a set up for a comeback, our Cornell students have potential come through struggles then thrive. The system of the school has the problem; it's too decentralized when dealing with depression problems. You need to get in touch of our experience and stop kicking students like a ball in the snow then traumatize us; this is the serious issue."

This is an oh-so-typical confession but there's a guy who I keep on running into on campus who I really want to approach. We met at a pre-Cornell event and I remember thinking that he seemed really sweet. As luck would have it, we have had many large classes together and we have run into each other quite often over the last few years but I've never had the guts to introduce myself.

This guy seems incredibly nice and is 100% my type but I have zero clue how to approach him. I keep on trying to gather my courage but my confidence crumbles every time I even consider introducing myself. I am already a junior and I don't want to pass up this person simply because I'm afraid of humiliation/ rejection/ attention..."

To 6661: I am a man who had a similar and extremely intimate experience with another man. I understand the fear, as I also am perceived as straight and would like to think I am. Sexuality is a gradient though, dynamic, and constantly in flux, subject to the experiences of that moment. In this moment, you are gay. If you love her, or even like her romantically, then l believe you will do what feels right. For me personally, those experiences greatly shaped my understanding of sexuality and I welcome the uncertainty of whether or not I'd be willing to fully out myself should I have another moment like the one that occurred years ago. I also welcome even the remotest of emotional attachment or strong love for--any male friend of mine. I'm not afraid to tell a guy friend that he's good looking or that I love a certain thing about him. Anyone that wants to shrink back from or feel uncomfortable about that is not worth my time. For you, it may be that this is not just an exception, but rather that your internal conflict is resisting other signs. Or maybe not. Either way, this is all apart of the process. Not sure how much this helps, but if it reaches you, feel free to reach out to me through here and I can give you more specific advice! No matter what, you'll have your girlfriend. :) :)"

I am a woman of color with thick curly hair. It is frustrating that almost everyday a stranger (usually white) puts their hands in my hair without my permission. This is usually followed by some back-handed compliment. I get even more frustrated when these same people get upset when I say that I don't like their behavior. My hair is not a playground nor is it a zoo. I don't care if you're curious. And no, I am not being sensitive. My hair is very personal to me. Please respect my personal space."

As a minority woman in a STEM field, I don't know how to feel about affirmative action. It has indisputably helped me. I have won awards and scholarships designated for females/minorities. I know that I probably would not have gotten accepted to Cornell if I were a white male. Yes - I believe I am qualified, but so many equally qualified people are rejected. 

I know affirmative action is designed to correct the supposed disadvantage I face. But I don't feel like I've faced any disadvantages in my life, only advantages. I've never been the only girl in my hard science/math classes. I've never felt looked down on or had people assume that I'm stupid or can't do math. Yet I have received opportunities purely for being a minority women. The thing is, I know many (most?) females and minorities do face this issues. They deserve AA, but I don't. 

I watch my (white male) friends struggle to find scholarships or internships. I'm not saying its easy for me - it isn't. But it is undoubtedly easier for me than it is for them. Some companies, like Google, have designated women/minority internships. Far more have quotas. Quotas that I fill. I know that I am qualified, but still, why me? and more importantly,  if I am filling that quota, am I taking the spot from somebody who actually deserves that spot? Somebody who did face disadvantages but prevailed?"

I am depressed. People wouldn't know it from looking at me because i plaster a smile on my face but something has come over me this semester. I'm worried about myself because I keep crying all the time even when I'm in the library trying to do work or in class I have to wipe away my tears and pinch my leg so I don't just start having a crying jag. The worst part is I'm hiding it from my boyfriend and I feel like I am lying to him. I feel like if he knew how I've been lately he would think I'm pathetic because he is  more strongminded then me. I'm also worried I'm going to lose him which makes me even sadder. I just want winter break to come. I called caps and they can only get me in at the end of the month because I presented myself as low risk even though I feel like I'm dying inside and can't stop crying"

I agree with you, even when I am a minority.

Why? because lately programs are focusing on ""how you look outside"" rather than what is actually going on. Based on what you said, I assume you are not well off, as in with money.

I wish programs focused more on income rather than just race, because it honestly makes it unfair to people who are poor and white, you are pretty much at the bottom of the ""preference"" list.

And to the person who commented, true, but does he need to pay for that? If your parents did something wrong/had privileges, would it be fair for everyone else to deny you opportunities based on that? Or the color of your skin?

We should strive for a more fair world, not one that creates more division."

I don't know what I expected. The first hookup was a surprise- it caught me off guard, but I went with it, even though I felt a little uncomfortable. To be honest, I had never hooked up with someone like this before outside of a relationship. I went farther than I wanted to, but I convinced myself that I really liked you, and that it would be ok. The next hookup, I was more confident. I guess you could say I was truly an ""active participant"". We had a sleepover again, and the more I talked to you, the more I liked you. I thought we got along really well, and we had great physical chemistry. You introduced me to all of your friends, and you mentioned how much you wanted to hang out and how ""lucky you were to have found someone like me"". You made a point to say hi to me, and you made me happy in a friendly way. Then, your texts and snapchats became less frequent, and eventually, nonexistent. I asked you about it, and you said you didn't want a relationship, which I understood (because I felt/feel the same way). I even asked to hang out, and you said you'd let me know when a good time was. Of course, you never did, but I assumed you were busy. But then I saw you holding hands with someone else. I wouldn't have minded that if you had just told me the fucking truth. Why didn't you have the decency to tell me that there was someone else? Why did you let me believe that you liked me? Even as a friend? Why did you drop me so suddenly? What did I do to make you dislike me so much? What is wrong with me? How could I be so naive? Why did I let you take advantage of me? Why was I so weak? Why couldn't I have said ""no""? Also, I guess that I have to admit that I did lie to you one time. No, I didn't have my period. I'm a virgin, and I was worried that you wouldn't want to talk to me again if you knew the truth. Little did I know that you were going to drop me anyways. :)"

I swear to God if I ever have children I will accept and love them unconditionally. I will tell them I love them just the way they are, Mr. Rogers style. Even if they end up being the second Charles Manson I will visit them in prison. I hope for the strength of character to allow them be their true selves and to give them the values and tools to help them get there. I don't feel that it's right to bring another PERSON into this world if you're just going to try to mold them into what is your own ideal and not theirs.  

For the rest of my life, I will likely have to deal with the emotional damage and crippling depression that comes from growing up all my life with parents that never truly loved me or accepted me for who I am but only for what I could be in their minds and my achievements. My parents, my father in particular (I can't call him my dad), pretty much let me down at every point in my life that I needed a role model. Instead, they always put unreasonable standards on me and brother with their words rather than leading us with their actions. They are the epitome of 'Do as I say, not as I do'. 

From little things, such as criticizing me for not being masculine enough, to big things like belittling me for suffering from depression, the consistent message I get from my parents were then and are today, 'We don't really like you for who you are. Why can't you just change to something we can like more?"" 

First-generation Asian parents are in general, a truly awful and emotionally abusive group of people and what makes me truly sad is that gathering from what I've heard from others, my parents weren't even that bad in the grand scheme of immigrant parents. But in the end, I have to try to understand. My parents were in turn raised by old-school Asians and unlike me, they didn't have the benefit of being raised in a relatively enlightened country such as the United States to help them see their errors. 

In any case, the cycle ends with me."

To cut a long story short:

 I'm lonely, I'm frightened, I'm behind, and I can't speak about any of this because no one here knows me well enough to care or want to help me.

 I'm afraid to let people know me, mainly because I'm secretly a somewhat soft-hearted, well-meaning, very weird/contradictory naif who's put up a shell of coldness and aloof behavior to deal with constantly crap reality.  It's not that I don't want/have friends - but this wall I've put up makes it so difficult for me to reach out and make human contact. I can't stop projecting it now though - without it, I'm naked, free for the metaphorical vultures to peck at. You live with the mask for long enough and it's all that the world can see. 

I know there might be ""easy"" solutions to this problem, and that my problems in the grand scheme of things are relatively meaningless, so if you'd like to criticize my behavior on either of those fronts, go ahead, I know these things are probably true. I mainly just wanted a venting session though, and now I've gotten it, so I'll be attempting to get on with this business of living. 

Best of luck to all of you."

Going back to what poster #6621 said about the United States being the only place where the first amendment still stands. I want to add something. Not only should you embrace other people's ideas but engage in discourse and debate and argue with others about their opinions. Do NOT accept one opinion as final but expose yourself to others. That's how people learn. Not being close minded to one opinion and sticking to it because they never experienced anything else and have lived their lives that way. I used to hate guns and thought that all people who shoot them were evil. A few semesters ago I took Handgun Safety and fell in love with the shooting sports and learned about the many misconceptions that are portrayed about gun owners and the sport. I found out that the sport is very safe compared to others and safety in the sport is taken very seriously unlike the media, that preys on negativity of everything, tries to portray it as something unsafe. In other words what I am trying to say is be fortunate you have the first amendment and use it to your advantage to experience other viewpoints and learn from others. After all that's what learning is all about and at the end realize how fortunate you are to live here in the United States as once again we are the only country that sticks to it's guns and guarantees free speech as written in the 1st amendment. Also if you disagree with someone by debating them and can't come to a consensus don't hate someone for their different beliefs. Shake their hand and tell them ""peace be with you,"" and both agree that it was the 1st amendment that allowed you to argue and engage in public discourse. If we lived this way without political correctness or worrying about what other people say, we would have a happier and more prosperous country, if not happier and prosperous world. In light of what has happened recently on campus with news agencies being banished, stand up for your 1st amendment rights because they are the reason why Cornell Confessions is here too. If not for the Constitution and it's 1st amendment, we would be living in a very dark world without different perspectives and without prosperity. There is a reason it was 1st: because it's the most important! After all, why shouldn't we stand up for our rights including the 1st amendment, WE ARE AMERICANS!"

I’m getting kind of sick of the frequency of these research/internship applications where minorities and under-represented groups are encouraged to apply. Don’t get me wrong, I think it’s great that they exist, and it marks a huge turning point in our country. But it seems like literally every paid position (in biology at least) that I’ve come across is geared towards minorities. And for a white male, that basically seems to equivocate to “don’t bother applying”.  I have no problem accepting the privileges I have as a white male, but it seems impossible to get anywhere with my career. Since freshman year I’ve applied to every program I could, but I always end up working through the spring to be able to afford a lousy unpaid summer internship that isn’t taking me anywhere. It was extra frustrating in the case where I knew the person who won over me was completely unqualified. It seems like the only way I’ll ever be able to work abroad is to buy my own plane ticket, and pay for my stay while I volunteer, and there’s no way I can afford that. I get good grades, I do great in interviews , and I have an insane resume.

In general, I see people here with their lives together and I just feel profound sadness because compared to them, I'm nothing. Having only really one true friend to talk to (with others who hate me) doesn't do much for my self esteem either.

In response to all these pro-conservative confessions, here's why so many people here are against Republicans.

When I talk politics with people, many of them accuse me of being anti-conservative or anti-Republican. They would be correct on many different counts. I disagree with Republicans on social issues, economic issues, global issues, etc. But that doesn't mean I am anti-conservative. 

There are some things I think the Republicans have right. I do think we need more tax breaks, but they should be affecting the middle class, not the rich. I do think we need to cut spending, but on the military budget, not on social programs. I do think we don't need to regulate Wall Street as much, but ensure that they do not manipulate the market.

When I'm accused of being anti-conservative, I correct the accuser and say that I'm not anti-conservative, but anti-bigotry, or pro-equality. The Republicans today are more conservative than they've ever been. By one popular index, they're more than double as conservative now as they were during the Reagan administration. This leads them to be against many things. Gay marriage, fair gender pay, women's rights, etc. Their name is now tied to anti-equality. And this is what I stand against, and this is why I am so passionately against a Republican Congress and White House. 

Because the Republican party has become the party of bigots and extremists. Because they stand in the way of progress. Because they would rather shut their eyes, cover their eyes, and scream ""LALALALALA"" than admit that we still have problems that need solutions. That's why we're ""anti-conservative."""

Response to 6595 (Summary: Honestly, Cornell makes people miserable): I think this is better stated as ""Cornell makes (a lot of) not extraordinarily extroverted people miserable"". Let's list reasons why!

Disclaimer: I think the vast majority of people here are pretty cool, its just circumstance that makes things difficult. I'm not personally bitter I just am trying to encourage people to realize that there is a problem with students being pushed into miserable situations and we as a community should rally to create tangible change. I remember the other week with a bunch of crap about mental health 'awareness'. To me that was just a bunch of kids posting trendy pictures on facebook (sorry about the edge, maybe it helped someone), but what did it do for the many kids who are left feeling isolated and rejected by the Cornell community as a whole? Mental health effects all sorts of people, but I think that particularly isolated individuals are at the greatest risk. I think in order to address this we can both lighten the stress load on everybody while maintaining the same level of academic excellence and we can provide social opportunity that is tangible even to more introverted students.

Assumption: Stress and social isolation are the main causes of misery.

1. Clubs and Greek life (No this isn't a frat hate post). These two groups probably compose the majority of the social scene on campus and they are by nature exclusive. I would imagine the general idea is to increase the amount of connections made by cutting away the amount of people. Kinda the inverse of the ""alone in a crowd"" idea. But to be in these groups you ought to be relatively outgoing and social to begin with, cite rush, application/interview process, or even for open clubs, the mere act of showing up (I personally hate putting myself out there; I'm just uncomfortable with it and no amount of patronizing will change that). Well crap, that means for introverts it's hard to meet people beyond classes. Unfortunately for big classes we get the whole alone in a crowd effect so that just leaves us with small classes which normally don't come until further on once friend groups have largely been established further locking people in social bubbles (what about active citizen stuff? see 'showing up' reason explained below). Oh forgot a note: Since the most extroverted people use these avenues to socialize it allows them to in a sense isolate themselves among other extroverts (ideally I think a mix of introverts and extroverts probably more indicative of a healthy community). Also clubs allow for a bit of racial stratification, but the effect of this point is debatable.

2. Student culture! Okay, this one is my biggest concerns. The culture of over competitiveness and dick sizing is ridiculous. It makes everybody miserable and doesn't serve the main instigators to any measurable degree.  On the saltiness of freshman year  (Luckily people (for the most part) grow the fuck up): Get over yourself, you're not even close to the best here (unless you're a medalist at an olympiad or do something crazy like take grad QFT freshman year, then free pass sorry; at least you get to big fish?). Just work hard and treat others with respect. Yes, you are graded on a curve, no, screwing over your peers one at a time will not make a statistically significant impact on your GPA. Now this problem is mostly an ego issue with the students but I would argue its slightly exacerbated by the way that Cornell departments normally grade students ( a good alternative might be a professor establishing what a 'A' quality work is as done by numerous other ivies). Now go out and tell your nearest narcissist to chill the fuck out! (Nicely though, no need to be mean) Also people here would stand to be a little more.. polite. The dismissiveness of some students gets on my nerves from time to time, but its New York so I guess I'm just not used to the culture. Oh and before someone talks about how over competitiveness breeds better students, note the over. Competition is good, but somehow other colleges seem to graduate perfectly damn good people without nuclear ego wars. 

3. Weather. Goddammit Ithaca.

4. Housing situation. This is by no means minor. If Cornell administrators think that they can push half (less but I have no idea what the actual figure is. Its a good chunk.) the student population off campus and not lose part of the ""vibrant Cornell community"" I think they're poorly mistaken. Build more housing please. The last thing we needed was a damn atrium. Also this is an observation but not much of one that has an easy solution: the fact that housing differs vastly by grade further stratifies social interactions making it harder for students to meet people/break out of social isolation.

5. It's a big university. A large university means a lot of freedom for an individual, but a more divided and apathetic community.

6. Passion. Maybe it just seems this way to me but most people here just don't seem to be very passionate about their majors.. It's either just a dick measuring contest or a ""I just want my six fig already"" type attitude. Where's the love ya'll?

Fixes: A couple thoughts
a. I actually really like the big-little system that some sororities use and I wish departments (especially in the hard sciences/engineering!) would use a similar method to cross that grade gap and provide mentorship to lonely lil nerds. 

b. Making the grading less competitive would make life a lot better too. Also pass-fail for the first semester of freshman year would have made life so much better (MIT and Caltech[trimester but w/e] do this and I've heard its stunningly successful).

The other problems are maybe too big to tackle directly. The butthurt of Cornellians is refreshed every year, clubs and fraternities will always exist (not that they shouldnt), housing is administrations problem and they couldn't care less. We could switch to using exclusively coal based energy in order to speed up global warming I guess.

*Barriers to 'showing up': I'm explaining this from my own mentality so ya maybe not so general. The reason why I'm scared of showing up is two pronged, a. I don't feel like I belong and b. I'm an incredibly proud person. Honestly I don't have much time for clubs because of my class load + research, so if I go to a club its basically for the sole reason of making friends. When you go to a club I feel like it ought to be because you're interested in the activity itself, but for the most part I don't really care and thus I don't feel like I really belong. For the second bit, I hate feeling like I have to use a club as an excuse to bolster my social life. I already dislike the fact that I have to use people as emotional crutches in general (i.e. for staving off loneliness and depression, I'd rather just be friends with people I really care about, but when you don't know very many people you don't have much of a choice)."

All these people saying Cornell over-reacted and was censoring Fox News really need to re-examine the situation.

1. All outside media news organizations need permission from Cornell's community relations department in order to film and interview on campus. This is not all that surprising. This policy serves to protect Cornell from the kind of stunts Fox News just pulled, and it helps to protect the privacy of students and staff members.

2. Fox News did not obtain permission to film or interview from Cornell's administration. This means that they were in violation of the policy. People argue that Cornell is public land since it obtains money from the state. If that was the case, then there would be no such thing as a private university, since just about every university gets some money from the state. Cornell is a private university, and as such, is well within its rights to have this policy in place and to react accordingly when it is violated.

3. Cornell did not pursue any actual means to censor Fox News. They could have issued a persona non grata. They could have had CUPD escort them off campus and have patrols running to make sure they don't interview anyone. Did they do that? No. They allowed Fox News to continue their ""story"" off campus without impediment.

4. This policy does not violate the First Amendment. It does not say ""Fox News cannot record or interview students on campus."" It says that all outside news organizations must obtain permission to record and interview on campus. This is the same ordinance that many townships have about organized protests:  you need to have a permit in order to stage your protest. This policy does not actively engage to limit free speech, nor did Cornell do anything to actively prevent Fox News from conducting their business at all (besides saying they can't do it on campus). This policy may be abused, but by itself, it is not limiting free speech or violating the First Amendment."

Not to draw away from problems that women face but I think there's a lot of unrecognized sexism against men as well, and it really frustrates me that a lot of people don't take me seriously. For example, guys are often victims of rape and domestic violence (at a rate of 1/5 to 1/3 of the total victims, if you don't count prison rapes) but do you know what happens when you call a hotline regarding it? ""Sorry, this service is for women only."" Fucking hell, as a victim of sexual abuse..."

Because everyone speaks of this 50's shit, I have to say I like the guy who plays at Penn Station NY near the 1,2,3 train entrance at the end of the LIRR terminal walkway near the McDonald's. He's awesome whenever you hear Bobby Darin, Frank Sinatra, or The Temptations covers. Anyone with me or know what I am talking about all you city Cornellians? I cannot wait for Thanksgiving Break to be home again in the big city again. After all I love New York over this prairie. I had no other choice, because Cornell was my safety school and I could not get into Columbia. So like Frank Sinatra sings:

Start spreading the news
I am leaving today
I want to be a part of it
New York, New York

These vagabond shoes
They are longing to stray
Right through the very heart of it
New York, New York

I want to wake up in a city
That doesn't sleep
And find I'm king of the hill
Top of the heap"

I grew up known as “boy crazy”. My first crush was in pre-k 3 on a cute blonde boy. I was the girl who was always, at any given moment, crushing on some guy. My room was always decorated with posters of attractive celebrity males. Once I cried over the beauty of Harry styles. Throughout high school I was really into this one guy for two and a half years and I still get a bit nervous when I occasionally see him. I was the least person you’d expect for this to happen to. 

At the beginning of my senior year, I met this girl and she completely changed my entire life. She was very gay, and I thought she had a crush on me – she would give little hints and act a certain way with me. It didn’t really phase me and I continued to be friendly with her and got to know her very well since we were on a traveling team together. We spent a lot of time together and she soon became one of my best friends. She wasn't obvious about her crush on me anymore, and she told me recently it was because I looked and acted ""completely straight"" and she believed it was pointless to crush on someone like that. At the time I thought I was all wrong about the crush and it was just me being cocky. Anyway, we got really close and I considered her my best friend. However, slowly, I began to feel something more, something different. Without realizing it, I began liking her as more than a friend. It was like a snowball rolling down a hill of snow - starting small and slow and getting bigger and faster exponentially. I denied it and denied it until I couldn't anymore. 

One day, in the car with her after a tournament, I looked over at her. She was looking out the window. She looked so damn beautiful and I took her hand and held it. She didn't move, (our team was all Latina and very touchy – we all would always cuddle in the car after tournaments and hold hands) She must have thought I was just being the usually touchy teammate and best friend. But for me, holding her hand this time was different. I’m embarrassed to say but I literally started tearing up. Half of it was because I was overwhelmed by this feeling for her. The other half was me saying “Well, fuck. I like her. She’s a girl. A fucking girl. How is this possible?!” I finally admitted to myself I liked this girl and that’s how it all began. For the next sleep away tournament we were roommates and had to share a bed. We cuddled every night. We were in a very beautiful place with beaches and pools and activities but every single second we had free without games, I just wanted to spend with her. 

During that trip I made it blatantly obvious to her that I was interested in her. She pretty much made it seem mutual. Even other teammates noticed. Three days after we came back, she told me she liked me. I told her that I liked her as well, and from there a long series of events happened including our first kiss, the day we started dating, family drama and way too much more that would turn this long essay into a novel. Well, we’ve been dating for about 7 and I am very happy with her. She treats me like a princess and I just want to make her happy. I love and care for her very much. She is completely open about us, her parents know and accept it and love me very much. My side is different. My dad doesn’t know. My mom found out and flipped out. She’s still not okay with it but she tolerates it kind of. My sister’s humiliated about it. 

Anyway, my problem is this – I want to tell the entire world about my girlfriend and show her off and post every picture. The thing is, I’m scared to be labeled “gay” because I really don’t think I am. Obviously, I’m a little crooked. I’m with a girl, for goodness sake. It’s only her though. For now, at least. She’s the only girl I have ever felt attracted to, mentally, physically, and sexually. I feel like if everyone here knows I am with a girl, they will automatically assume I am gay, and honestly I am not ready for that label and I doubt I ever will be. I don’t know what to do.

I know the usual advice – don’t care what people think, don’t label yourself or let other people label you, just do what makes you happy, etc. It’s not that easy. I don’t know anything and I am still confused about how I feel this way. A little over a year ago, if you told me I would like a girl, I would have laughed in your face. But it happened and there’s no going back. Is it possible to be straight with one exception? I don’t know. All I know is I love this chick in an extremely stronger and different way than any platonic friendship should be."

When I was younger, like elementary school aged, I was a really big trouble maker. I would talk back to the teacher, say ""bad words"" that I heard from other students, and I would smack kids who didn't agree with me. I was on the road to be a ""bad person"" according to the principal of the school and many of my teachers. My mom and dad then instituted corporal punishment in order to improve behavior. Every time I got a note or phone call from the teacher, my mom or dad would give me a good spanking over my britches with the ""Board of Education."" A few months later I improved in school began getting better grades, after almost failing second and third grade. By the time I entered fifth grade, I was a high honor student and I went into accelerated math by the time I entered sixth grade. By the time I finished middle school I was placed into Pre-Caculus into 9th grade. I took AP Calculus BC in 10th grade and scored a 5 on the AP BC Exam. So the corporal punishment was temporary, but actually improved my behavior and made me into a great person and very successful at Cornell. I'm not saying it should be used until high school or into adulthood, but sometimes a kid who receives some spanking or has some fear instilled into him or herself is more successful. I think not having anything to fear is a bad thing for a trouble maker kid. I think everyone of us needs fear to achieve our goals in life, whether its the fear of becoming a drug addict or poor if we don't succeed in our school work, or the fear that we will end up massive losers. Fear is everywhere. When my parents opened up their own business they feared failing. A healthy amount of fear is necessary and sometimes corporal punishment can instill a healthy amount of fear into a trouble maker kid, and propel him or herself into becoming a successful and contributing member of society. It did work for me and I think if I ever fell into depression or a low point in my life and refused to be successful or work hard, it would work again for me to receive another good spanking with the ""Board of Education"" as my parents called it. So therefore, I agree with the OP that corporal punishment should be used in some circumstances to improve moral and encourage someone to become successful. I believe if more students who were troublemakers received what I had in elementary school, they would be able to make it into a great college or become successful in their vocations, future businesses, or careers."

In regards to all the references to confessions being ""trolls"". Let me post something ""trolly"" myself. I feel like ""troll"" is the most used and incidentally misused term on the internet. Any time anyone says something annoying or defiant or ranty or sarcastic, it's automatically labeled ""troll"". People certainly modify their opinions when you introduce anonymity, to make them more stringy and ironically in the context of ""trolling"" -- more honest. Everyone has opinions that they know they cannot express in public because they will be ridiculed (often rightly), so they keep it inside, and they use anonymous internet posting as an outlet. Sometimes they enhance them a little, just to add to their point and stick it to people who think otherwise, like a child does when they don't get their way. It's not some crazy phenomenon, humans have been doing this for thousands of years. It doesn't make the content of it dishonest or invalid. If anything it makes it more honest. And even if some posts are completely fabricated to stir controversy -- what do you care? Can you ever test for that? Can you read minds? Does it matter? Are they opinions people actually hold? Yes. So why do you care? You're the trolls by calling them out, by your definition. You're the ones stirring controversy.

This post was a good example of my point -- I'd never say this in public. I am being a ""troll"", but the point is legitimate."

And because I like him and I want this to be more than a meaningless romp, I feel like I am obliged to tell him the truth before anything happens between us. But, I am sure that this information will drive him away from me faster than rats fleeing a sinking ship. I don't know what to do, and this scares me because I actually care about him and I want him to like me. :-( Actually, I do know what to do, so I guess I am just going to spend the next couple of weeks, eating junk food in order to build up the cushy layers that will cushion the inevitable blow :-("

Even though I don't agree with Fox News, I think the university's response was exaggerated. They should have been allowed to interview students because students are adults and can consent as to whether or not they would like to be interviewed. I would defend to my death, anybody's right to speak out and say what they believe in even if I do not agree with them. After all that is a right granted to us in the Constitution under the 1st amendment, which protects offensive speech. You do not need to protect nice, flowery language ever. Ours was the first revolution in the history of the world that changed the course of government under the three words: WE THE PEOPLE. We the people of the United States have rights and that includes our 1st amendment right to disagree with others and say what we want but WE WILL NOT BE SILENCED DAMMIT! I am embarrassed to go to Cornell, which was founded as a land grant college and as the ""First American University."" Yeah Ezra, a Republican, must be rolling in his grave as basic American values are violated especially how the new president wants to regulate speech. My ass that will ever happen and I will sue the university since it does get state and federal money to operate under financial aid programs, DARPA and research grants, and to operate the statutory colleges of NY. Don't you dare limit my free speech. Skorton was so much better, even though he had extremely liberal views, he was open towards freedom of speech and academic freedom, as well as a fiscal conservative who grew up from humble beginnings as an immigrants' son. Lets not go farther than that were we currently are standing. I wish he was back again. I will really miss him even though we differed on a lot of opinions. :("

I feel like a lot of the misery at Cornell is self-inflicted. So much of it can be avoided if students just take a step back and evaluate what they want. There's no need for anyone to take 18 credits of crazy classes and destroy their GPA / future job prospects. As a senior, I have never felt overwhelmed or stressed during my years here because I took 12 credits of easy A classes every semester. That allowed me to do almost no homework and skate through classes with a decent GPA and with my free time, I was able to network and land a banking job at a top-tier firm. The kids in my classes who obsessed over grades and tests and classes are still struggling to find jobs. Anything you learn in class, especially if you're in A&S, will never be applicable in your job so just take easy and fun classes and relax. 

Cornell isn't about what you learn, it's about how much fun you have and what you get out of it."

To the Student Assembly, President Garrett, et al., in response to ""Mental Health Week.""

Cornell has had a history of depressed, suicidal, and over-worked students, and our reputation for suicides dates back well over a hundred years. If you want to actually address mental health on campus, then talk about the real issues that students struggle to deal with: weak financial aid, unhealthy work loads, grade deflation, sub-par and underfunded Gannett services, alcohol and ""study"" drug abuse, sexual assault, hazing, etc. If you're actually that out-of-touch from the student experience, start by reading the desperate posts on Yik -Yak or here Cornell Confessions. Let's have an actual dialogue on student experiences on campus, not the disgusting PR campaign that ""Mental Health Week"" turned out to be."

My parents didn't let me return because they didn't believe that I deserved it. They make a lot of money, and just bought themselves a second house the same price as another three years at Cornell. The worst part is, I can't pay for the state school I'll be going to in two semesters on my own despite working full time until then, so I have to smile and pretend to be happy for them so they'll still help me with the cheapest college I could get into."

There are some really reasonable and good points, some questionable and incomplete information, and some ignorant or downright wrong points in your confession. But I'm not here to break everything down into detail and start another back and forth (this wonderful page already has enough of that going on with the troll.) Instead, I will simply suggest you reach out to the Sun with a public response to be published.

Ever since I graduated Cornell I gained 20 pounds. I don't think a guy will ever date me now because I look ugly with the extra fat on my stomach. When I was at Cornell I couldn't afford the bus so I had to move my ass each morning to the Ag Quad. Now I just have a lazy office job where I don't move around a lot and take public transit to my job with no walking at all. At this rate I will become a diabetic or worse. At Cornell I ate ice cream everyday and lots of shit, but here I really have to start watching what I eat. I wish I took a more physical job rather than being a secretary all my life. It's such a boring and lazy job without much movement. :( I even get bullied by my mean co-workers and this had led me to start antidepressants which have also contributed to my weight gain.

I think finding Jesus again in my life was the best thing that could have happened to me. I love to go to Sage Chapel when no one is there and in peace and solitude pray for the well being of this country and the world. I hope one day Jesus will make us live in peace again throughout the ends of the world so that all religions can co-exist in peace. I like to sing I Know That My Redeemer Lives by Scott Soper and hear my voice echo through the high ceilings when I am alone in Sage Chapel. With Jesus I no longer feel small in what was once a dark and large world, and I can come to understanding the reason why things happen the way they do. Sage Chapel is my favorite place to be on campus even when I am alone because I feel like I am one with God. May God Bless everyone at Cornell and around the world so that we may one day live in peace. I pray that one day God will also unite me with my soulmate so that we can get married in God's house and live through and spread his word. I also hope that those who are in darkness and despair may one day find his calling and live in peace. To the student who sometimes preaches outside of Willard Straight Hall about finding God, may he also bless you and give you strength for sharing his word. Amen."

A few days ago I took one of the most important prelims of my life. It would decide whether I would pass the class or get an A. Whether I would end up living in the subway as a hobo who plays plastic bucket drums for an income (which is my plan B) or win a Nobel Prize. In other words, this was the prelim. 

On exam day I opened the question booklet and my jaw dropped. None of the problems seemed solvable. But failure was not an option. I began writing. My efforts seemed futile at first, but I slowly progressed towards an answer. Things started going well midway, my confidence was recovering and time was on my side -or so I thought. Out of nowhere my right nostril starts spewing blood. It was the dreaded nosebleed. Impeccable timing. 

Fuck it I thought. If I went to the bathroom to get tissues and wait for the bleeding to stop, I'd be down 15, maybe even 20 minutes. I tore the first page of the exam paper, which only had directions, crushed it up, and plugged it into the nostril. It was good enough. My peers stared at me with disgust. They wanted me to fail. But they didn't understand the stakes.  

Not too long after I faced yet another obstacle. My mechanical pencil had run out of ammo. There was no mercy. I was being attacked from all fronts. What to do? A minute had already been wasted. I unplugged my nostril. Good, it was still bleeding. I spread the blood on my finger and used it to continue writing. That's right. I used my fucking blood to write my answer. That's how motivated I was. 

Running on only fumes I completed the exam just seconds before the deadline. I stumbled to the front of the room, exhausted but victorious, and gave the exam in, signaling the end of battle."

Don't let the hipsters confuse you. You are your GPA. Your GPA is you. Without one, the other does not exist. The definition of GPA? You. The definition of you? GPA. One cannot talk about a student without talking about the GPA. Why? Because the student is the GPA. They are one.

Most guys would fuck just about anything. Furthermore, for men to be attractive to women they need to be skinny and exercise regularly. For women? Being skinny is usually enough.

I have to get this off my chest.  I graduated last year, and I'm finding that the real world and relationships is more complicated than I ever thought.

I think a married man is having an emotional affair with me.  We're part of a campaign group and a lot of us are professionals at different stages in our lives who believe in the cause.  I'm the youngest person in the group.  I work really hard on this project because I've been obsessed with succeeding professionally, and I'm less inclined to spend my time w/ people my own age who maybe don't take care as much about their work.  All of us go out after work events and meet up pretty frequently, both for social and professional matters.  I've made great friends through this project, which is nice because working a shit ton and not having the patience/willingness to get shit faced every weekend at fratty bars makes it less likely that I'd be hanging out with people my own age.  But maybe that's because my college friends were the wrong type of people for me.  I don't know.  It's been a weird year. 

The guy is 10 years older years older than me, has two kids, a great wife, and a lawyer for one of the best law firms in the city.  We've know each other for a year now, and I think he's one of my best friends.  He's a very stand up and busy guy but he's always available to talk to me.  We mostly talk about work and the group, and it's nice.  I've been to his house a couple of times for his kids birthdays, and his wife is amazing and sweet.

Something's changed, though.  A while back, someone that we work with commented that our relationship was weird-- he apparently listens to my opinion more than they thought was appropriate.  I didn't think too much of it, and I joked about it with him over text.  Later that week, we met up for drinks after work, just the two of us.  We've never hung out alone, but I had to vent to him about something.  We drank a lot and we talked a lot. It was easy, and nice, but at the end of it, he brought up that other person's comment, and asked me if I thought it had any merit.  I said no, we're friends.  He said he doesn't have female friends and that he never hangs out with women alone.  I didn't know what to say.  It was weird.

The other day, we went out with the project crew again.  It was great, we all had a great time, but he texted me priviately, asked to hang out w/ me alone after they left.  I agreed. We ended up lying and ditching them and then going to another bar and talking until 4 in the morning.  He told me that lately he's been thinking of me all the time.  I joked that it was because we work on this project all the time and we're in constant contact.  Occasionally he would put his arm around me and I'd put my head on his shoulder.  It wasn't anything that I hadn't done before w/ some of my guy friends, but none of them were ever in a relationship let alone married.  

I feel guilty and weird and confused.  I've been thinking about him all the time too.  I don't know why, it never was a thing until someone pointed out that we were strange.  

I don't even know how to approach this with him.  I'm torn between wanting to see him and talk to him all the time (we called and talked about the campaign a few hours after we left each other) and just quitting everything and walking away from him.  His life is great-- one of my favorite things about him is how much he loves his kids and how great of a husband he is.  I don't want to get in the way of anything, and my gut tells me this is trouble.  I can't talk to anyone about this because I also don't want people to gossip and cause unnecessary drama-- it could cause real harm to his wife, and I never want that.

I don't know what's going to happen."

    From Yik Yak and this page, it seems Cornell is mentally traumatizing a lot of people  (from regular stress to fantasies of suicide)  but people are only vocal in anonymity and publicly pretend everything is okay. Heck, I know most of you agree with this post but won't even like it because you are ashamed what your friends or family may think.

As a transfer student, I was considered the best, or at least very talented in many different areas both in high school and my previous institution. But here at Cornell, I'm not the best or especially talented at anything. Moreover, a lot of the classes I took at my previous institution, which was regarded as a good school, did not prepare me for the level of breadth and depth presented even in the introductory level courses here. I feel dumb and so behind. Every time I try to ask questions, people look at me like there's something wrong with me for not knowing the answer. I feel like I'm never going to fit in here."

I want to offer my opinion/rant on TCAT service -- I've seen multiple confessions praising TCAT drivers and explaining how great they are. NOT in my experience. They never show any understanding. They NEVER wait for you, even if they see you running for the bus. On numerous occasions, probably 20+ I've been within 10 feet of the door and they just take off. I'm from NYC and drivers there are much nicer despite having to deal with much crazier ****. In addition to the no waiting, TCAT drivers are rude. I've been yelled at a few times for ""improper boarding"", i.e. before people have gotten off, and it was only because there was a straggler I didn't see, and I would have backtracked without your yelling. They're always grumpy. They're generally very uptight, and not willing to bend the rules one bit. Technically, they're right, but by no means are they to be praised. It's an expensive and crappy service. The no regular buses after 6 PM is beyond ridiculous. Not the drivers fault, but just another FU to people living farther away. The service should really be free for all Cornell students no matter what. It's a tiny tiny amount compared to tuition anyway. Stanford's bus system is free. I visited a friend there and all transportation was free and much higher quality. TCAT is terrible."

And the times that I'm with people there is such a stark contrast before, during, and after. I can be depressed as all fuck immediately before and after butt during I'm actually happy. I'm more productive even if I'm just in the same space as friends even if we're doing completely different things. And I find I can actually enjoy myself.  But they have to be friends.

I've never been in a relationship, partly because the opportunity never arose but also partly because I'm afraid. Afraid of potentially losing a great friendship. Afraid of ending up in an unloving marriage like the one my parents are in. They don't hate each other or anything, but I've never once seen them behave in a way a loving couple would. The fact that I've also never seen my aunts and uncles behave like loving couples doesn't help. How do loving couples behave after 30 years of marriage anyway. Does everyone just end up tolerating his or her spouse?"

I'm out as asexual to most of my close friends, but none of my sorority sisters know. I always feel so weird when the topic of hooking up or dating comes up. I feel like I have to pretend a certain part of me doesn't exist around my sisters. I haven't even told my big, and we're best friends."

I love three Art Deco buildings on campus: Mann Library, Day Hall, Thurston, Kimball, and Riley Robb. They remind me of a simple time in American and Cornell history. Oh, and I also love Beaux-Arts Warren Hall. Oh, and not to mention the Industrial style look of Rand Hall. Upson is okay, I mean nothing special since it's only Modern International Style bleh. I like to walk around campus and share my knowledge of building styles by giving students a story of each building and throw out architectural style terms. I don't know what my life has become. :/"

I messed up. I really liked you as a person and when we got to hang out I would forget about everything and just enjoy your company. But I was holding back. I had my reservations about us not talking as much as I wanted to, but I was too scared to make the first move. I've dealt with a lot in my life, but having you disappear has made me very sad and disappointed in myself that I didn't trust and take a leap of faith. I wish I could see you again."

I like women who have that distinct sweet NYC accent and voice from the 1940's or the 1950's. That's the reason why I fell in love my current girlfriend and we relive the days when the country was great when we go see a move or play in the city, or just go get something to eat at a classy restaurant in the city. You can see the women I am talking about in both mine and my gf's favorite movies such as North by Northwest where Eva Marie Saint stars Eve Kendall or The Clock where Judy Garland stars Alice Mayberry. Oh, I wish I could invent a time machine and warp back to the 1950's with my girlfriend. My girlfriend and I share the same ideals and she wants to be a housewife, while I will take the real job of making money for our household like the man is supposed to do. At least I know we won't be contributing to the highest divorce rate of all time once we get married, which is already past 50 percent today."

I came into Cornell wanting to join a sorority. I've always wanted the sisterhood/family/community aspect. But talking to other freshman who want to rush, it seems like everybody is just wants the party/social status part of it. Is that really what it is like here? I like to have fun and go to parties, but I'm not super into drinking and partying more than once a week. I don't know what to do."

Lately, people have been asking about my plans after Cornell, especially when they learn I'm taking time off before medical school. I always find myself giving vague, halfhearted replies about work or graduate school. Truthfully, I know exactly what my plans are, and where I see myself in the long run. I learned a long time ago, that not everyone needs to know everything. While this is not true for everyone, some people are so evilhearted they will purposefully stand in your way, because they cannot fathom the idea of someone else's success. Also, I'm not simply referring to acquaintances or classmates, this includes my advisers and professors, and others. Only my  family and my few friends whom I love very much have been privileged to know certain things about me that might seem uncharacteristic to others and I plan on keeping it that way."

I currently hold multiple jobs because of financial reasons and trying to balance that with my studies is starting to drain my energy and I've noticed I get cranky really easily now. I want to cut back on the amount of time I spend working, but I don't know if being overly booked and stressed out is a legitimate reason and if my employers would even care. However at the same time I also need the money because my parents are working so hard to make ends meet and I don't want to be a financial burden to them when they're already invested so much in trying to get me into college. I sometimes wonder how my life would be different and probably easier if I were born into a nice middle class family like most people on campus. But that isn't my reality and it's hard for me to talk about this with my friends who are clearly much better off than I am financially. I realize that I have it better than some people around me and I probably don't have a right to complain compared to those who don't receive financial aid and still can't pay, but I just wanted to get that off my chest.

This is more a response than a confession, but to the girl who wrote the opinion article in the Daily Sun on 10/20: I have a few points to make.  

First of all, whether or not multi-cultural sororities/fraternities have a house depends on a lot of other things - it's not like the rest of the Cornell Greek system (which multicultural organizations are a part of, FYI - it's not two different systems) is saying ""Oh, you can't have a house, but we can.""  Chapter houses are can be extremely expensive ventures, and chapters (depending on their national organization) usually also have to be able to have enough members to live in those houses to justify and support that kind of venture.

Most importantly, I have never experienced racism from any of my Panhellenic sisters.  Ever.  I'm not saying that there aren't racist people at Cornell, but calling the Greek system that as a whole, especially at Cornell, which has such a diverse student body, is ignorant.  

Now to address what you said about the aftermath of George Desdunes' death.  I didn't know him, but had sisters who were friends with him.  What happened shouldn't have happened; that's a fact.  But to say that the entire Greek system (which happens to encompass a third of Cornell's undergraduate student body) should have been held accountable and punished for the actions of some of the members of a single chapter is, to be frank, silly.  Yes, there should have been, and always needs to be education and programming in regards to alcohol and hazing, but to punish a third of the students on a campus that is already mourning the loss of a student would have been even more devastating.

I know that that's your opinion, and you're welcome to have it, but want to know my suggestion?  Try to get to know the Greek system, and the people in it.  Our letters don't change that fact that we're all individuals."

I want to start drinking.

I vowed to ignore alcohol and drugs in college due to my incredibly compulsive personality (an addiction to video games growing up, for example), a desire to keep my grades up to personally high standards, and my dad's own destructive alcoholism. But honestly, after going to college parties for a good two months every weekend, I've seen that my personality is useless in a party setting. I'm known to act as an idiot during ""fun times"", but I'm actually very calculated in my stupidity: like, I try to evaluate the social gains and losses brought upon by every comment I make and every action I do. In a party, I can't hear people due to the blaring music and I can't see anything due to the crowd. Sensory disorientation prevents me from evaluating my situation, so I reason it's beneficial to be totally impulsive in this kind of situation, which I couldn't do unless my personality were changed for the better. This is where drinking comes in."

I don't really enjoy being in my room with my roommate. It sucks because we were friends in high school, but now I just really can't stand him. He told me about a two months ago not to listen to anything without headphones when he's sleeping, which I understood and never do for his sake. But then he plays computer games and chats and talks loudly til 3 in the morning while I try to sleep, and isn't reciprocally considerate. He also always repeats how a class I'm in is easy, when I really don't need to hear his opinion and I don't think he should be qualified to criticize a class he's never been in. 

I understand people may  think I'm biased, but I really don't think I am in this situation. I was at fault I guess once when I would put my alarm for an early time and it would wake him up too; he told me he wanted to leave the room because of this (which is kind of drastic for just an alarm issue). I switched my alarm to a phone alarm and entertained his request out of consideration, even though it led to me missing class once. I just feel if I'm respecting his requests he should respect mine."

Today I saw someone I'm friendly with working at the RPCC Dining Hall. She's a very nice girl who obviously worked hard to get to Cornell. I was heartbroken. I'm guessing that she is forced to work a job in order to pay for her education. I can't even begin to imagine the kind of drive that takes. Now here I am, a fairly wealthy student, attending Cornell without any financial burden. It's not fair that she should have to do this. I just so happen to come from a family with more money.

It used to be that it was the strong husband's job to raise the family right and provide discipline. This included corporal punishment for the children or wife if they acted up. Families grew up strong and many times the husband would hug and kiss his wife after providing the discipline. It was not meant to hurt anyone but to instill better behavior. I think it provided a husband with an intimate way to discipline his wife. This is why families grew up stronger back in the day as my grandmother told me once, where divorce was not as prevalent. I discipline my girlfriend because she also grew up in a traditional setting and she wants to continue this intimate relationship when we get married in a couple of months because she said it will instill a stronger relationship, especially when I take on the man's job of also discipling the kids. Call me traditional, but whatever, I'm not the one that will need a divorce lawyer in a couple of years because my girlfriend and I will have a strong healthy marriage into the future 'till death do us part."

I'm so lonely at Cornell. 
Yes I have friends, and I'm even on an academic team. It's just that most of my friends find my too clingy... whenever I make new friends, I want to spend all my time with them, do everything with them. And I think that annoys people. 
The friends I do have never want to do anything with me. No matter what I suggest and when I suggest it, they turn me down. They insult me a lot, saying its just jokes, but it actually hurts. I've started spending more and more time alone, because I'm sick of being insulted and rejected all the time. I seriously just wish I had a friend who would just tell me ""leave me alone for a few hours, I gotta study,"" whenever I'm talking to them/asking them stuff but they don't have time, rather than the friends I have now, who instead of saying that, hold it all in, and just start hating me and finding me annoying. 
I seriously wish i had SOMEONE to talk to... I'm the type of person who hates being alone. i hate it. i cant tolerate it. dont get me wrong, Im not depressed or anything, I'm actually really happy... just lonely. 
I can't really explain it. Except that the friends I do have aren't REAL friends... and I'm really just looking for a friend wholl just listen to me, understand me. Tell me to leave them alone for a bit instead of bottling up their feelings against me because I keep talking to them (because they havent told me not to)."

I wish we had been doing this for the last two years, but I'm glad I had the time to become the person I am today. The old me wouldn't know what do with someone like you. I mean seriously, you're so... ALIVE. Such a human being at your core that I almost feel like you know something I don't. How could anyone be so comfortable and warm?

I'm a conservative lesbian who is also pro-2nd Amendment, but I have no friends on campus as I feel my beliefs conflict each other and it's hard to meet people who share the same beliefs. Imagine visiting the LGBT resource center on campus and saying that you're conservative and like guns. They will immediately call you the devil and ostracize you. Luckily, back home I am a member of the Pink Pistols, a conservative LGBT gun owner community where I feel welcome for my beliefs and we have frequent outings with like minded friends, so I never feel as lonely as I do on this campus. I actually don't support marriage of non-heterosexual couples and this causes people to snap, even people who are not in the LGBT community. I prefer domestic partnerships for non-heterosexual couples, because I still believe marriage is a sacred institute to create children for the future wellbeing of a country and obviously LGBT couples can't have children!"

I can't wait to finish and graduate from Cornell in December and move back to Pennsylvania. I like PA better than NY because the state's taxes are lower (both state sales and income) and the state has lower prices on products than NYS because of lower regulations. So what if my electricity comes from coal, nuclear, and natural gas or that my furnace burns oil? At least it's more reliable and less expensive than NYS's electric grid. Global warming is a hoax anyways. I also can conceal carry back in PA and live free, knowing other people are possibly armed too and it makes me feel safe if some mentally-ill nut job decides to shoot up a place I visit. Oh I miss Pennsylvania for it's beautiful farms. Plus they have Allentown and a lot of beautiful rust belt cities where I love exploring, while Ithaca on the other hand along with a lot of upstate is boring as FUCK. I also have my car in PA unlike Ithaca's expensive parking (and few parking lots) and can drive my '99 Jeep or '01 Suburban without worries of offending any hippies or hipsters. I don't have to ride the smelly TCAT buses. I can also visit the shooting range in PA and hone my target skills. PA is THE BEST!

But this time I smoke too much too fast and I really thought that I was gonna die. It was like my saoul got out of my body and was watching the whole scene of me paniquing from outsidemy body. I was so scared I thought of my family, my mom and my sister, and how sad would they be if I die. My friends were scared to call 911 so they just covered me with comforters because I was shaking so much and stayed around me until I got back to my normal state.

The reason why I like guns over illegal drugs is because most crimes involve drugs, but very few involve firearms. If the crime involves firearms, there is a 90% chance that person was high on legal or illegal drugs. Plus, the 2nd amendment guarantees my freedom to own a gun, no where is it written that drugs should be legal. Personally, if we had a Singapore or even better Saudi Arabia style ban, we would be better off in this country like we were before the 1960's when the red diaper doper babies infested this country with drugs."

Cornell has a lot of feminists.

I have studied gender and race issues a lot, and recent (i.e. not the original 1980s glass ceiling study) studies show that white women are no longer at an economic disadvantage. Short of personal choices (having kids & being stay at home moms, studying a low-paying major) white women have achieved economic equality.

So why is it that feminists here primarily focus on the economic issues of white women? Why not focus on social issues, such as sexual assault? Why not focus on the very real economic issues of minority women, or just minorities in general?

I love feminist women. But not the white ones that only ever talk about the glass ceiling, in their own context."

Responding to the girl who posted that my 1950's Eisenhower post was fake. I graduated in 1955, after starting an engineering program in Mechanical Engineering in 1950 (since the programs back then were 5 years for a Bachelor of Engineering Degree as opposed to the 4 years for a Bachelor of Science Degree today). My wife and I got married two weeks after our graduation, since she started in 1951 at the Home Economics college. So instead of calling me a liar, maybe you should stop doing drugs or alcohol, and start focusing on improving your basic mathematics skills. It's basic arithmetic, and you did not use logic to outcome for the different possibilities. Anyways I hope God has mercy on your soul and blesses you with the best of intentions, before you accuse anyone of being a liar. That is the last thing I would be since I am quite religious. I wish to remain anonymous because I do not want to point out my last name, as my granddaughter goes by the same name and I do not want to embarrass her or have students attack her for her strong conservative family values.

There was this girl, a missed opportunity, a pearl in the sea, the one who got away, if you will. 
We met on Tinder, and perhaps it was destined to fail from the beginning. But let me tell you the story anyways. We watched movies together (it just happened to be netflix), cooked together, and even studied together. What made me gotten close to her the most, was that she invited me over for a thanksgiving party she hosted so I can get to know all her friends. It felt magical, although perhaps it was something she put in her butternut squash soup. Over the course of thanksgiving break, however, the tone changed. Maybe she met someone else, or she was going through something, and I would do anything to help if she'd let me. 
I invited her to my formal knowing that it would probably be the last time she would say yes to me for anything. I enjoyed every moment we had together, and Italian food just so happened to be her favorite. But something did change, and we ended things shortly after. 
Thinking back, I realize she's the most beautiful and sweetest girl in the world, to me. She wanted to do well on the MCATs so she can be a pediatrician, and I'd do anything to go back in time to help her study. I'm working hard in a related field as well, and if fate permits, maybe we'll cross paths again someday, and she can give me a second chance."

I called my mom today because I missed her like hell and I've just been SO homesick lately. We talked for about 20 minutes--and then the conversation started making a turn. She does this thing where she 100% believes in whatever people tell her and then proceed to compare me with people she knows. I told her recently that I scored just average on my prelims, and how I was a little bit disappointed with that but not too terribly upset since I was still trying to get the hang of things with being at Cornell/being a college student... anyways, long story short, she started comparing me to her friend's son who goes to UMich and has a 3.9 GPA and her friend's daughter who went to Georgia State who graduated and has a good paying job now. She just kept telling me how they work so hard, she brags about them, and it makes me feel like she wants them to be her kids or something. (she has never even ONCE bragged about me or even told me that she was proud of me. In fact, she was disappointed that I got into Cornell because she wanted me to get into Harvard or any other one of the 8 Ivies--classic, right?). She then said I was being ""too arrogant"" and ""just dreaming"" when I told her I want to go look for an internship for this summer (some of her friends told her that college students HAVE to wait until sophomore year to start looking for internships). The thing is, I didn't even say I'd FIND one, I just told her I wanted to see if I could find one. I know there are Cornell students who were successful in finding an internship their first summer--I don't think it's 100% impossible, as she says it is. 

... Anyways, I feel like I can't please her. Even being at Cornell and doing alright in my classes, meeting lots of new people, living away from home, and even going out of my way to make connections with professors and upperclassmen... I'm not good enough. The thing is, if I HAD gone to UMich, Georgia State University, or any other school that she typically talks about, I KNOW she will then compare me to another student at like... Cornell. I don't think I will ever be for her, and that's just so damn depressing. I've been in a really bad mental place recently and honestly, this conversation just made it worse.

One of my friends have been struggling with depression lately and I told him things get better. Because that's what I personally want to believe--it gives me something to HOPE for. Knowing that there are better and brighter days ahead certainly makes dragging myself through today worthwhile. But even as I say that to myself now, I don't know if I believe it anymore. My mom has certainly made it perfectly clear that I am not--and will never be--good enough for her."

It's so kind of the Cornell students to try and reach out to a lot of us that have these issues on confessions. But I'm too embarrassed to actually try and contact them.

I have noticed a lot of guys have very bad perceptions of women and dating. A lot of the times, it's the guys who have not gone out with many women seem to blame women for it. Just FYI, saying ""girls don't like me, they only like assholes"" is about the most asshole thing you could say and provides a pretty good reason as to why women would not like you. Claiming that you are entitled to women liking you and wanting to be with you is just plain wrong. It is a form of sexism and misogyny and is ridiculous. If you see a woman you are interested in: try to talk to her pleasantly or go about your day. Just don't say ""what is her problem? she should like me!"", because no one is SUPPOSED to want to be with you if they don't want to."

#6511 If you're who I think you are, then you're referring to me. I'm as sick of this is as you seem to be of being reminded of it. I'm glad you don't think about me anymore, and honestly something in me believes that. I don't know, maybe it's your sense of humor regarding the whole mess.Still, I'm guessing that running into me is really messing with your head, which is why you apparently keep turning to confessions to cope. I'm not even mad anymore really, though I don't know why you think I need to ""get over myself."" But, considering our history, you saying that is the least of your transgressions lol. I'm not mad about that either.

Anyway, you're right on both accounts: What you did was dumb. But this is also a dumb thing to stress out about. Let's just deal with it. The next time you see me, I'll stop walking. If your confession was about me and mine is about the person I think it's about, then you'll know and you'll stop too, I hope. I'm sure a brief convo will end this. Then you really will be free of all thought about me, even when you see me. And I can stop dreading seeing you too. Hoping you'll think much longer and harder about these decisions from now on, though I think you've already started."

If my experience with scientific research as an undergraduate at Cornell could be described with one word, it would be disillusioning.  I arrived as a freshman thinking I was talented, experienced, dedicated, innovative, and all those attributes that make a good scientist.  I thought my lab experience would enable me to work with faculty to engage in significant research in the field of my interest.  Yet, I realize now that in the eyes of the research faculty here, I am really just a nobody.  I am just an undeserving undergraduate and a pesky premed.  With the exception of one researcher whose lab is no longer operating, no professor would even give me a chance to show just how passionate I am about science.  Yet, there is nobody to blame but myself.  Maybe in comparison to other undergraduates here my research experience is insignificant.  Maybe I am bad at interviewing and cannot impress any researcher.  Maybe I am too impatient to effectively utilize the office of undergraduate research.  Maybe I should have went to a lower tier university where my skills and experience would stand out and I would actually get a chance."

Reply to comments on #6513:

For those in the comments making assumptions about what kind of student I am (or am not), I'll clear it up for you.

I don't know if I'm necessarily the greatest student in my classes, but I consistently make A's and  high B's in a rigorous STEM major. 

I never intended to imply that all students feel this way, but making a generalization to denounce someone else's generalization (i.e. """"The top students in (*ahem* REAL) classes always study concepts in great depth."""") is kind of silly.

My post is coming from the over-achieving, self-deprecating perspective that I feel nothing I do will ever be good enough (regardless of whether or not it is A-grade material), rather than the assumed perspective that I'm lazy, don't manage my time well, and/or have conflicting priorities.

Hope that helps."

At first, I loved the tinder app. It gave me everything I wanted for the year after my relationship ended. All of the fun stuff, none of the drama or the work. But now I hate it with a passion. I have no idea how to meet people anymore, no idea how to make a relationship happen. I don't live in the dorms anymore so I rarely meet new people, and when I do, it's rarely on a regular basis. How are you supposed to find a significant other like this? It feels so impossible to find something more on tinder. I feel like these guys don't want something more. They've gotten everything they want, and none of the work to maintain it, and maybe even a rotation. Why would they want to stick with just one girl! Gah! Boy! I just want to tell you I like you without you running away thinking it's getting too serious. I want this empty feeling in my heart to leave. I want a boy to like the idea of 'us' as much as I do. I want to be wanted for more than just a release. I hate this hookup culture."

I was so excited for graduation. The place I interned at last year had promised me a good job. The day after I graduated, they emailed me to tell me they would no longer hire me. Since then I've lost count of how many applications I've sent. I was living with my parents in an extremely rural place, and had no friends or contact with anyone. Tonight, they kicked me out of the house. I have nowhere to go, no food, shelter, or warm clothing. I don't know where I'm going to spend the night, or if I'm going to survive long."

i love cornell, but recently ive been feeling so lonely.
I have friends, I'm even on a team (academic one). But every time I make new friends, i become too clingy. I start asking to do everything with them, and I know that they eventually get tired of me. eventually these ""friends"" start doing things and not inviting me, or just ignore me whenever I say/suggest something. it really sucks. Maybe I am too clingy, but im not like rude/annoying. I don't know what to do.
I've been, as many of us are, under a lot of stress, and I destress by being around friends and doing fun things, but recently ive just been growing further and further apart from not just my friends, but team mates too. and i cant talk about this to anyone, cause i dont want them to think im some attention seeking psychologically disturbed kid. Im not. im an ordinary guy. im actually really loud, try to be funny, and social. but as most lonely people know, that doesnt mean anything.
then theres also the people who just belittle me all the time, idk why. maybe cause they think im annoying, or maybe cause they just dont like me. but i try to avoid them as much as possible, but obviously i cant always avoid them. 
if ur reading this, u will prolly never figure out who i am, even if u know me. but i seriously just wish i had someone to talk to.... a friend who would actually understand how im lonely, but still pretty happy and not like disturbed or troubled, and wouldnt judge me for it."

I have been away from school for more than six months now (because of depression). I've been alright while I was away but the thought of returning back to school this spring is more than giving me cold feet. One would think I'm not ready to come back to school but I miss cornell and Ithaca so dearly and finally getting to be me (I'm queer which will never be an option in my country) is beyond enticing but..

Going back to the OP # 6498 who wrote about the death penalty for drug traffickers. Instead of wasting money ordering barbiturates for the lethal injection and also using massive amounts of taxpayer money for the setup and doctors required, I would support the use of a firing squad in addition to ""Ol' Sparky"" for death penalty offenses like they still do in Utah. I think morale would improve in society if more states started using the cheaper method of a firing squad like they did in the past, after all they only need a cop and ammo, both of which are already available to perform this execution for high level offenders. It would not only save money, but also reduce crime and the need for high reincarceration rates like in the states of New York and California because people would be afraid of committing a high level crime, and the murder rate would drop to the low amount it is in states where the death penalty is very prevalent like Texas and Oklahoma."

I am glad someone spoke up about corporal punishment and mentioned the benefits of using it at Cornell. I got hit by my parents for making mistakes and I grew up to be a respectful, non-weak individual who didn't complain because I had a real father, not a weak one who would divorce my mom and leave to find another women. I am glad to have had such strict parents because I am now making six figures running my own business after just graduating 3 years ago. I think the discipline instilled within me was the best thing that could have happened. I hope to keep the same discipline in my household when I have kids and I hope that liberals don't outlaw my way of raising my own kids the right way."

My mom was trying to hold off telling me because she knew I had an exam today. After the exam I received the sad news. I don't know what to do since my dog was my true best friend. I literally have no people to talk to here as I am a first semester freshman who could help me through this. My mom works 2 jobs so I don't really have anyone else to talk with. I wish someone could help me because every time I think about it I wish that a motor vehicle just hit me so hard that I would not even feel it.

I love Cornell, but sometimes I feel like the biggest lesson we're learning here is how to cheat the system. I never have time to do all of the reading for each of my classes, much less analyze and distill it with care. As such, I'm not embedding very much of the material, or engaging with it to the degree that I feel we should.

I feel like I'm gleaning useful knowledge here and there, but for the most part it's cramming for what you think will be on the prelim without gaining a full understanding of it. It's learning how to write papers that sound intelligent and cohesive, despite that your research was slipshod and you had to write all 15 pages of it in 2 days.

I feel like any real education in my field is only going to happen after I graduate, and I actually have time to study concepts in-depth."

Cornell has crushed my spirit but K have found the remedy. I went to the Red vs White hockey game and I can honestly say it lifted me out of the funk I've been in.

Dude!! We both live on West, so we're bound to keep running into each other on stairways, paths between dorms, in dining halls, etc. I cannot be more clear: I DON'T LIKE YOU ANYMORE. I don't think about you AT ALL. At this point, the whole, trivial matter is like a long, sad joke to me, like much of my love life until recently lol. Yes, what I did was unbelievably stupid (although I really should have been able to confess in peace, and your friend's unnecessary instigating is ultimately to blame here.) Yes, I would be pretty disgusted by my presence if I were you too AT FIRST. But...seriously? Are we really still doing this? Get over yourself. The way I see it, we have four options here:

1. We can be strangers who walk right past each other. This simply requires that you get over yourself and forget, like I have. Then, even when we do see each other, I won't have to be reminded by your averting eyes and change in facial expression that we're not complete strangers.
 
2. We can just pretend to be strangers, which again is not hard, if you just get over yourself and forget like I have. 

3. We can deal with the issue. I'm happy to do this, if you'd like. This again requires that you get over yourself. The next time you see me, just walk up and acknowledge that I'm the guy who made that post. I think you'd find that the dumb-ass kid who did that and the person you talk to are very different, and we'd end our correspondence on neutral terms. We don't even have to be acquaintances. I just don't want to have to vent on here every time I run into you, be slightly miffed for the rest of the day, wake up  having forgotten about you completely, then run into you again a week later and repeat the process.

4. We can keep doing this shit, and no one wins.

Oh, and if you'd rather I broach the issue/approach you first, just let me know through here. I'm totally happy to do that, and would prefer it. I just figure you don't want anything to do with me, which is fine lol"

To #6475:
Oh dear. Why, in an academic environment with so few of us Southerners, would you associate the activity of your high school with a region that has already been portrayed by the media as a bastion of illogical and crude activities? I am from ""the South"" as well, and posts like this are the reason we receive ignorant questions from our misinformed peers. You're propelling some particularly damaging narratives with statements like these. I do agree that there is a regional difference in terms of respect for your elders/educators, to some extent. I also won't fully condemn corporal punishment on the parental level, at the discretion of the parent and within moral reason. But this idea of GROWN ADULTS taking ""a good wackin'"" or  ""a good paddlin'"" in the South is a fallacious generalization that does nothing good for the region. I don't know whether you're trolling or joking or what, but some people will believe you either way. So please stop. If your high school continues this practice and has had success, wonderful for your high school. Whatever. I'm not bashing your upbringing or beliefs, especially since I can at least give you the benefit of the doubt because you said ""where I am from in the South."" Nonetheless, those last three words are completely unnecessary. Please, please don't attribute the activity or its success to the South. Please."

As an international student, I am appalled by the way lower-class Americans employed in servile professions like cleaners, baristas, and cashiers behave. In all countries those people are uneducated, but in America they are stupid. In all countries those people are not polite because they do not know how to be, but in America they are deliberately rude. In my country, and in other Asian countries, our service people are deferential and hard-working, or else they get fired. In America they are loud and obnoxious and lazy. The exception to this pattern of thinking, I have observed, is the waiters and waitresses who work extra hard for bribes. Maybe if Americans also stopped paying a minimum wage to other service personnel and made them work for bribes instead they would not have this problem."

All humans are equal. Whether you're a girl, a guy, gay, straight, Mexican, whatever, you have the same right to opportunities as anyone. No one is intrinsically better or worse. Period.

As a guy, I can attest to the fact that guys, by and large, get irritated by the feminist movement. Is it because we are misogynists and we hate women? Are we dicks? I don't think so. We don't like it because girls constantly bring it up. They use it as a crutch. Maybe they don't intent to do that, but that's the way it comes out. Sometimes it even comes out as an attack against men. I know this may not be the intention, but its true. If you want equality, then just be equal. Try your hardest in life. That's what guys do. Let me tell you a story about this girl from my high school (I will call her girl X). 

X was a freaking genius. X was amazing socially. She had tons of girl friends, tons of guy friends, everyone respected her. She was getting amazing grades and she's always so nice. But she was different. She never brought up feminist issues. She never acted like she was disadvantaged because of her gender, because she wasn't. She just gets work done and succeeds at what she does. All the guys respect her. No one thinks she any less equal. X is one of my best friends. 

X is an example of how women should approach gender equality. They shouldn't constantly bring up the issue and demand equality. Work your hardest and be yourself, then society will naturally confer equality onto you. I promise you. I'm a guy, I'm friends with a lot of guys. You can take my word for it. This wasn't the case in the past, but I truly believe that nowadays it is become more and more the case. 

I know people will dismiss my opinion, but that's all it is, my opinion. Take it or leave it. Moral of story: try your hardest and be yourself. Guys don't think women are intrinsically worse. I swear. We just get irritated about how they always bring up race."

I wish that the people on this campus would care more about each other and not obsess over whether they get A or A+. Please, spare some time in your day listening to the people around you.

I wish I could amalgamate a group of conservative believing students to do that by Baker flagpole every morning before we make our trek up the hill and begin our classes, to pray for each others well being and that of our campus community who may not be spiritual so that they may too hear the word of God one day in their lives and be blessed by his presence."

Sometimes when I think of my childhood, I start crying. It was a nightmare filled with racist classmates who would just ignore me, an overworked father who was never home and an unemployed mother going through postpartum depression. Both my parents were strict and used corporal punishment and to this day, I instinctively flinch if I see my mom coming towards me. Not to say that childhood was all bad, but just that it makes me sad think about it now."

I thought Cornell would be a new beginning for me, as a trans guy, to finally come out of the closet and live my life authentically.

I really don't think it's a healthy way to discipline people. Maybe you experienced it and you think it's fine, but..."

I wish another ""Eisenhower"" were president again, preferably someone who was a war hero, as I am an older alum who started following this page and have to say most of these posts are not even close to reminding me of what Cornell used to be like. My granddaughter now attends Cornell and she was raised in a conservative family. She was shocked by the campus environment and encouraged me to follow this page in order to see how Cornell has changed from the days I attended. I always described to her a happy cheerful, postwar version of Cornell. I went to Cornell in the 1950's when life was cheerful under Eisenhower's administration and we built up the greatest nation on Earth, and I met my beautiful wife of 60 years there. I even remember my ROTC days where all men had to participate in the army training exercises there. The program was amazing and I met many of my lifelong friends there. Through the program, I received an inexpensive education and dutifully served my country and received many honors to ensure that my grandchildren can live in a better world. People were very happy and not weak and depressed like they are today due to the massive use of hallucinogens, alcohol, and anti-depressants. May God bless all of you to stay away from these harmful substances and so that you may do well in your studies. We can only depend upon young men and women like yourselves to propel this nation to be great again like it was back then."

I used to have nightmares that Filch's cat (from Harry Potter) was an Animagus who was forcibly trapped by Filch into a cat's form. Poor witch was probably lured, seduced, and left to live out the rest of her days at the mercy of the wretched lecher, who took on the identity of the unassuming caretaker of Hogwarts to avoid any suspicion.

To people who post long meaningful/political confessions on here -- why don't you start a blog? I don't mean this in a derogatory way, I mean it seriously. Your confession will be seen by a few Cornellians on here and in a few weeks will be deleted. Wouldn't you rather it was seen by more people in a more relevant context, and stayed somewhere for as long as you wanted it to? You probably spent 20 minutes or more on some of the confessions I've seen on here. And there is some really deep, moving, significant, existential stuff.

Now each face is burned into my memory and my obsession with your perception will not go away. And this wouldn’t bother me if you were alone, but you are one among thousands. You are either one I know, and I couldn’t show you exactly what you needed to see in full, or you are one I don’t, and I will never get to show you anything at all or know your story while still staring at my reflection in the mirrors that have replaced your eyes. I’m done with your eyes, done completely with yours and yours and yours. All I see is myself now, and it’s not the self I am but the self you’ve made me to be. I’m sick of this constant façade. It is as if I might as well be looking at mirrors instead of people, in them is reflected all of my sadness, paranoia, anger, self-awareness, obsession and pain. Their twisted perception and ruthless apathy manifested in every gaze.

Ann Coulter is my favorite Cornell alumna! She is amazing for speaking up for the conservative causes in this country and taking back this country from the left. I am proud to be a woman attending Cornell, because I hope that one day to be like her, a woman fighting for what she believes in no matter what anyone thinks. I also support Pamela Geller, another distinguished woman on the conservative side. These women are true feminists showing that women can also be involved in politics and make a difference to make America great again! I am like the OP of #6456 who would be bashed by the liberal population at Cornell if any of my non-conservative friends found out my true beliefs. Whoever wrote about Michael Savage in that post you rock and thanks for finally speaking up for the conservative cause! I also like to listen to him and I believe if more people followed his common sense we could take back the country from the cancer that has metastasized and make America great again like Donald Trump said!"

I kind of wish corporal punishment were instituted at Cornell if students act lewd on campus or disrespectful by texting or using their laptops in class and not paying attention in lecture. Where I am from in the South, my high school would paddle students who disrespected the faculty or received a bad grade on an exam, as an option over spending Saturday detention. Many students got a good wackin' from the teacher or principal, and quickly got the message they should not be disrespectful. Even in the 1950's, my parents remember how Cornell had the ""in loco parentis"" mission to make sure students grew up into respectful young men and women when they entered society and the workplace by making sure they would meet curfew and dress appropriately. I would also take a paddlin' if I got a bad grade on an exam from a professor and would learn quickly that I need to study more because it would hurt even more the next time."

I haven't had confidence in my abilities or intelligence in a long time, so I thought I would start anew here at Cornell, try and muster up some self-esteem. Throughout high school, I was constantly pushed aside or looked down upon by my more successful peers. There was no one subject or area that I could excel at and call it my own talent. Even though I understand things are all relative, and that I shouldn't care about what others think, but today just completely proved that no matter what I do people will still think lowly of me.

This week, when we got back our prelims, I was just average on the curve, nothing good or bad I think. But then today, when I was struggling with some homework, I think my friends got fed up me, and then they just started calling me things like retard and dumbass. Although, I shouldn't be let down by people or name-calling like this, I still feel that no matter how hard I try, what I do, or where I go, there is no escape from being viewed like a pathetic pile of crap. It's just too easy for me to lose faith in my skills these days, and there is no way back up."

Is it a problem that I have the opportunity to use the race card to get everything I want in life that the liberals gave me? Yes! I'm a conservative black myself, and it feels humiliating having priority for a lot of things in life because you are black and ""disadvantaged"" in the eyes of liberals. Sometimes I feel as though I am inadequate because of my skin color that I have to gain some privilege above Caucasians. I just wish everyone were equal in society and we could forget about slavery and all that crap and live in harmony like we were before 2008 before people started turning against each other and the Black Lives Matter Movement came into effect. As a black person myself, I have to say I despise the movement along with the cops lives matter movement and would rather have #AllLivesMater instead of singling races out which is brewing more racial hatred."

I want him to like me back but I don't know how to express how I feel towards him.  Furthermore, I can't tell if he likes me because of how he acts towards people.  I've gotten the vibe that he does but when I had the opportunity to act or say something I hesitated because I really wasn't sure.  We've known each other for a while but the only time I really see him is when we are with our group of friends.

In response to #6450:

I swear it's like I wrote your confession. I am in the exact same boat that you are - 20, just realizing that the ""admiration"" I've always felt for other women is a little (read, a lot) stronger than that, finally understanding why I've never clicked with a guy despite knowing some really nice ones, and feeling, despite the fact that I know my family and friends would accept me for who I am, still terrified to actually come out. 

I can't give you advice, because I don't know what I'm going to do. I can't reach out to you because this is an anonymous page. But I want you to know that you are not alone, and that you don't have to do this by yourself. Take it one day at a time, and step by step. One thing I've learned while trying to start navigating this process is that it doesn't have to be an avalanche - just move one stone at a time.

My romantic connection with you is more passionate than any I've ever had. However, you are so different from me both culturally and religiously that I am hesitant to pursue it further. It saddens me to think of the strong possibility that our families and friends wouldn't approve.
 
But, to be honest, I am tired of trying to find someone who is as deep in the faith as I am. I am consistently treated as a pariah by many in the community for drinking alcohol, and for this same reason many religious girls I have pursued haven't even given me a chance (they told me this was their reason outright). I have a very strong faith so I would've preferred someone I could share it with, but life is just the way it is sometimes. 

Overall, maybe I should just throw caution to the wind and give you a chance. Because when everything goes wrong, you are the only one still there."

I'm a 20 year old female and I'm gay. I've always had thoughts about women in romantic and sexual ways but I always though these were just ""girl crushes"" or out of admiration. I've been with guys before and many of them were very sweet and wonderful men, but I never felt quite right being with them. I assumed it was because I was too immature to truly love another person. Now, I've come to the realization that I'm gay and I see myself ending up with another woman. I'm 99.9% sure my family and friends won't care but that doesn't change the fact that the thought of coming out absolutely terrifies me. I think about how this will change everything, nothing will ever be the same, and once I step out of that closet there's no going back in.

This is in response to the comment responding to #6423, from someone who said that maybe the foreign students from Asia don't tip because that's not their culture and that maybe the waitress should adapt to their culture in attempts for more tips:

Your argument is ridiculous and belittles the fact that these waiters and waitresses aren't making tips because someone from another country hasn't learned the customs of their current country, which they absolutely should learn to some extent if they intend to be here for a few years. I'm not saying that their culture is wrong or that the american culture is better, but when in rome do as the romans do.

You wouldn't travel to another country and expect those people to adapt to your culture because hey, maybe that will make you feel more comfortable.

These students not tipping should have learned about these cultural norms, particularly tipping because there are huge disparities between almost every country in regards to tipping. Should the waitress then ask where every foreigner is from (which may be disrespectful in itself) and then go in the back and google that countries' customs on dining out and adapt every time? 
That's ridiculous, and your argument is ridiculous. I understand if you were just trying to clear the air by explaining that they're not used to this, but you suggested that the waitress adapt to them. And the fact that you [that commenter] tend to tip more in Asian restaurants because they bother you less or adapt to your needs greater than someone else's, that's so rude and you shouldn't forgo tipping someone because they took the time to make sure you were enjoying your meal, like so sorry that someone is trying to be polite. and you know in some cases people do have something to say when asked that, even if you don't have the balls to admit if something is wrong.

I'm not even a server or in a food service job but this just irked me so much."

I'm a freshman here and it's very hard to live in a dorm occupied by mostly outgoing people. I don't know when ""college life"" became synonymous to ""getting shitfaced drunk and bragging about how many girls I fucked"" but I certainly wasn't notified of the change. It doesn't help that I'm male either. For some bizarre reason, I am expected by society to go on drunken rages, show off my ""masculinity"", and act like a neanderthal. I've overheard some of my dorm mates talking behind my back a few days ago. They were calling me a loser for not being at frat parties and hooking up with random girls. I had my door locked and closed so apparently they assumed that I was at the library studying like I normally do. Every word stung bitterly. Back home I was taught that real men are responsible and caring. At Cornell, I guess the degree of your manhood is measured by the amount of alcohol you consume and the number of girls you have sex with. Honestly, I don't give a single fuck about what they're doing in their own time. They can drink, they can have sex freely, they can do drugs, if that's how they socialize. But insulting my own way of living behind my back is just rude  Luckily, I found my own social group of introverts so I don't feel as alone. I just wish people would stop branding me a ""loser"" for just wanting to spend a part of my day by myself."

Confession 6423 really bugs me.  Several times when I've eaten in college town, the service was exceptionally poor and very rude.  I tip very little in these cases because I'm not going to tip you a lot to be rude to me.

On two separate occasions when I've done this (at two different restaurants) the waiter or waitress charged me for a lot more than I wrote on the receipt (my writing isn't messy), which is clearly unacceptable.  Both times I had kept the receipt and ultimately got all of money back as an apology from management, but the fact that this has happened more than once is disturbing and unacceptable.  I'm sure this happens a lot and people don't notice, but it's fraud and it's illegal."

This university needs to do something drastic about housing. I'm a freshman and I already have friends signing ridiculously priced 12-month leases for shitty houses in college town. The ""guaranteed"" housing here is an absolute joke. My understanding is, IF you're lucky enough to be one of the 300 non transfers who get to live in the nice buildings on west, you stay there for your junior and even senior years and it makes it even harder for underclassmen to find places to live.  
I have no desire to join greek life, so that isn't a housing option for me. Cornell is stressful enough without me having to worry about how I'm going to ask my parents to pay 12 months for a condemnable house in college town."

I'll be graduating with an engineering degree in the spring, yet I feel mentally and emotionally unprepared for the job world. Although I had a little bit of work experience in my field this past summer, I don't believe it has prepared me for a fully-fledged job. As a result, I've been walking into interviews unprepared and unconvincing, despite the fact that I can articulate myself quite well. I've been applying to some jobs I might be interested in, but only half-heartedly, because somewhere deep down I haven't quite figured out what I want to do yet. I don't know how to explain it, but something just doesn't feel right- I don't feel ""ready"" enough. It's a bit unnerving because all of my peers full-out seem to know what they want to do, and I don't know why that level of maturity hasn't hit me after 3 years at Cornell. Maybe it's because I never took full advantage of the opportunities around me (research, work, etc.) outside of my coursework. Maybe I wasted 3 years trying to do well in my classes when I really should have been more career-driven, or more focused on building a network. I know that once I figure things out, I'll be determined enough to achieve anything I want, but I'm a little worried about my future at the moment because inside, I'm full of doubts."

Tinder is a vat full of disappointment for us sensitive souls. We reach in with the ladle, going back for seconds and thirds, and are left with the same bad taste in our mouths each time. I'm not talking about those of us who actually use it for what it's for - I'm talking about those of us who mistakenly go on it in search of meaningful connection; to find a significant other in a world where it has become increasingly difficult to do so. A world that is dominated by technology and, ""no - I'm staying in tonight (to watch Netflix/play iPhone games/Facebook...)."" I really should know better than to use this app and try to hook someone with a witty comment or something, but I don't know what else to do. I don't know how to manage this world of dating and getting to know guys...  I'm completely lost, and I don't want to be anymore. I think this will be the last time I delete tinder."

It's been a year since the last time we ever saw one another.

You came and visited me for Fall Break. It was so bittersweet. Right from the start, it felt like a goodbye; you were cold and distant, unable to conceal your frigidity...nothing like the girl I fell in love with. But I can't fault you for that - we hurt one another pretty badly. I guess that's easy to do when two people care about one another so much.

We'll never speak to one another again, never see one another again; I've spent many months coming to terms with that. I've made my peace with it, as much as a body can.

But you still own a piece of my soul; I can feel the hole in my heart where it belongs...it aches every time I hear one of our songs, or remember the scent of your hair. You've got that little piece of me tucked in your pocket, forever and always.

""I love you so much; never forget."" Great line from a great song.

Every time the leaves turn to orange and gold, I'll pour out the spirits and raise my glass to you.

This one's for you, Red. I hope you're safe and warm, wherever you are."

I have a real problem. I cannot go a day without masturbating. I wake up in the morning, go to class, and during a break I'll find time to go to the bathroom and masturbate. It's fucked up, really. I've been late to events, I've put off work, all just to masturbate. I've masturbating on planes, trains, even a bus.

I know that virtually everyone at college masturbates. And that's even more fucked up. Everyone here masturbates all the time, yet no one admits it. Masturbating has to be the best kept secret of all time. Chances are, if you're in a public restroom, the person in the next stall is probably masturbating. Isn't there something fucked up with that?

I consider myself an introverted person, and I hate it. I am naturally awkward, and I go through these awful mood swings where I just cannot tolerate human interaction and I'm just overall depressed with the quality of my life. I've never had a girlfriend, or really any girl who has expressed interest in me. I have a stuttering problem, and it is generally difficult for me to give off a good impression of myself and just make new friends. I know I'm fairly attractive, so the personality I exude must be deficient in some way, shape, or form. I want to be more outgoing, I want to have more people to talk to, but I just don't. I take out this frustration and anxiety by masturbating. In reality, though, I should be facing my social fears and be productive with my time. But it's way easier to jack-off. This has made me socially inept, and an overall weird and lazy person. I know I can do better.

I'm going home for Fall Break, and I'm looking forward to reflecting on how my freshman year's been going, and what I can do moving forward. One thing I'm going to try to do when I return after the break is to stop masturbating. It's a bad addiction. Stroking my penis is literally consuming my life. Not only am I wasting time doing this stupid activity, but I actually think this habit is affecting me psychologically. I've been reading the sub-Reddit ""NoFap,"" and there's a lot of positive things to be said about quitting masturbating. You become more motivated to do things in life, you have a greater sex drive, and you become more extroverted. I want to meet more people, I want people to like me, I want to do amazing things, and I think quitting masturbation is a step in the right direction towards achieving these goals. I know it's not going to be easy to end this addiction, but I'm up for the challenge. By abstaining from masturbating, I will become more self-reliant and confident in my abilities. College is all about trying new things, and I seriously think this will make me happier."

It's really frustrating as a waitress in Collegetown when students dine in and don't leave a tip. I understand that in some countries tip is already included in the bill or there's no such thing as a tip to begin with. But sometimes I feel like some students that dine in deliberately don't leave a tip, especially international students (from China)... It's frustrating when after nearly an hour of service they walk right out. Waitresses don't earn that high of an hourly and we depend on those tips. We're students before waitresses and tips really do make all the difference. If you think the service is not up to par, still leave a tip and let me or my manager know. We would much prefer that. Or just don't dine out. Tipping is just proper etiquette in the U.S. and if you don't, it just reflects poorly on you as the customer."

I'm very surprised by the number of politically correct people are commenting and posting on overheard. These debates are so ridiculously elitist and it actually seems like a contest to see who's the most PC. Instead of getting into arguments over Facebook, why don't any of you who get offended by spilled milk and Instagram posts go around campus and actually talk to the workers you're so eager to speak for? You're so prepared to be the mouthpiece for the entirety of the maintenance staff on this campus but in reality, the vast majority of you have no idea what it's like to work at a job in the service sector. I think privileged people telling other privileged people to ""check their privilege"" so they can continue speaking for people they've probably never even talked to for more than two minutes is ironic and sad. We as workers do not need you to be our voice."

I want to talk to him. I want to chat with him, yet I'm afraid that he'll get annoyed. I'd think about him almost all the time when I'm not studying. 
I don't know if he feels the same way. I don't know if he is that nice to everyone as he is to me. 
The passed few days we didn't chat as much, and nor did we get to see each other.
I miss him.
This is my first time liking someone after middle school, and I never felt this way, I was never so troubled---partially because I was too young to fully understand if I was really having a crush on someone or was I just looking for that ""love"" everyone keeps on talking about.
Maybe I should confess, I don't know. I don't know what to do.
I keep telling myself to stop thinking about him, what he's doing, what he is thinking. Yet the more I think about stopping, the more I think of him.
These feelings are overwhelming me."

I am so grateful for my parents. Sure, I complain about their quirks but talking to people here (and reading posts on Confessions/Overheard) has made me truly realize how amazingly lucky I am. They have made so many sacrifices over my life to allow me to be at Cornell today.  Above anything else, they value education. My dad has a solid job, but still has been saving money since (literally) before I was born, so I could attend college without the limitations of financial worry. 

He is also well-versed in the career world. As in he is able to give me advice (good advice) about what classes to take, how to find/apply to internships, etc. He wrote my first resume in early high school. I ask him for help and advice on so many things. As the son of two WWII refugees, he overcame so much and does so much so I don't have to overcome so many challenges. 

I guess with that, I also really want to acknowledge how much help and advantage I gain from him (and my mom). I can't imaging trying to navigate college/the world without them. I am constantly impressed and amazed with the tenacity and dedication and just... everything of students who are alone financially or are without their parents familiarity with the college/career world. Even the little things, just a general understanding of college, is so helpful. So I guess I just want to acknowledge that I feel unbelievably lucky to have my parents and I know I can't even begin to imagine the struggles people who aren't in my position face every day."

I'm a quiet, unattractive person, and I'm beginning to think I'll be single for life. Oddly, I'm fine with this. However, I don't know if it's because I'm 1) Asexual, 2) Managed to so strongly convince myself I'll never be liked by anyone that I've shut all possibilities out, or 3) Just haven't met the right person yet. Another thing is, I'm terribly afraid of commitment, and I'm afraid to hurt people. As a result, I find it difficult to emotionally open up to people, and this includes my closest friends. I'm 21, and I can't imagine kissing or having sex with anyone. I can't imagine anyone caring about me, hugging me, or even touching me. In fact, I find the concept bizarre- or perhaps I've just alienated myself from it, believing it to be unreachable for someone like me. On the other hand, when I see couples around campus, I do occasionally wish I had someone who cared about me. I guess I'm just really confused."

I need to start asking for references next year for grad school applications.

I try to only ask ""good"" questions (but not too often...I seriously only go to office hours maybe once a month), I try not to waste their time, and I try to be respectful yet confident. I don't know what I'm doing wrong. 

(The other day I asked one of my professors a question during office hours. One of the TA's was nearby, and the professor motioned her over and said, ""*Exasperated sigh* You deal with her,"" before going to help a few other students, to whom she was very nice.)

All of my teachers in high school loved me. All of my professors at the school I transferred from loved me as well, and were more than happy to give me references and help me succeed. Maybe I just don't understand the culture here. I feel like such a failure."

""My reflection"", he calls me. And though I've recently tried to distance myself, with every passing day it is reinforced that he is the one. He must be because no matter who I talk to, or who I kiss it is simply not the same. 

I'm sorry if these recent actions of mine cause you pain. I just hope that you know that I've loved you, perhaps before I even met you. Everything I go through serves a purpose, to help teach me what it is that I should have in this lifetime. Although we have doubts about the future-you were always the one to tell me that fearing and doubting are the two greatest evils. I want you to listen to your heart and mine when I say all of this. I just want you to recall it all. Each and every second of us---even those we've spent away. I want you to do this because I want you to fight for us, to make it happen. That's all I'd been trying to do---but now that I've eased off of it I realize my life is empty without the drive of keeping you, fighting for every ounce of your love.

There are many different types of people. I would like to talk (or vent) about two of the many types.

The first is ones like me. Though I'm generally nice to people, I also hate and despise many people. I don't really try to hide my hatred, but at the same time, I never had to confront. In result, people, except very few whom I call my friends, often find me rude.

The second is ones that I have problem with these days. They are nice. Well, to be precise, they act nice. Everyone ( well majority of them) thinks they are the nicest on the campus.

One of the second types started to hate me. I can understand why she would hate me but it's reaching a level that I can't really understand. However that's not a problem at all for me. I don't really care if she hates me or not. I can casually ignore her with no problem. The problem is our mutual friends/acquaintances. Since I'm not the 'nicer' one, as she (somewhat) publicly speaks about her problem with me, everyone seems to believe it. I guess it's my fault that I never tried to defense myself. But why should I? especially when I did nothing wrong.

It's kind of annoying that people are so gullible with such fragmented information. I guess it filtered true friends for me."

It's depressing to read these posts on CU Confessions, especially the ones that are more serious in  nature (not the typical ""i'm lonely please help"" posts.)

I worked my ass off to transfer into Cornell because I envisioned Cornell as being a place where I can engage with people who are passionate about learning and have a sense of purpose and direction in life. Now I realize the depressing fact that some of us feel disillusioned and can't foresee a bright future once we graduate from college. 

When I was at Basic Training, I was so pumped and excited to go to Cornell after I received my blue cord because I anticipated that I would be in an environment that could secure for me a meaningful future once I graduated.

I feel like i should chime in on the Overhead at Cornell debate thats going on right now:

As someone who was essentially a janitor of a small school over the summer (cleaning the entirety of the school was one of my duties), all of you guys trying to correlate spilled milk with notions of class privilege/class warfare etc are reaching hard as fuuuuck.

A person who spills milk on the counter of a table isn't some inconsiderate asshole who symbolically spits on the working/lower classes, she's just an inconsiderate asshole. In my experience as a janitor, nearly EVERYONE accidentally makes a mess and forgets to/doesn't clean it up at some point, even my coworker who shared my janitorial duties. People who make accidental messes aren't privileged classist assholes, they're just assholes.

If you still disagree with me, then think about this, and I say this from experience-- cafes/restaurants/etc are just as dirty, if not dirtier, as those in Cornell."

Also as a follow up to the Overheard confession, to the people making fun of the two Go Fund Me pages: Ya'll are basically making fun of people for not being able to afford Cornell. 

What a privilege it is to laugh it off, and not be the person hurrying in to make the October 9 deadline so that they can keep their place in the only hope that they have for their family to get out of the shitty circumstances that they were born into. I guess for you if you had to leave Cornell, you'd have Plan's A - Z of other options for your future. We're fucked. 

I can imagine that it's tough for these students to create the page and ask others for help (like many of us, we've only relied on ourselves for help all these years, anyways). You think the process couldn't be made any more difficult than it is (studying for prelims, while trying not to get kicked out, wondering where your parents are going to pull that money from even though they themselves can barely get by at home), but no. Your own peers make fun of you. 

Grow up."

To the people on Overheard at Cornell who think it's funny to look over not picking up after yourself, posting pointless (and pretty tacky) memes to detract from conversations that are important to the people who actually have to work these jobs and clean up after your nasty behinds: you are assholes. Crying so much about having your precious feelings hurt (basically you feel offended because someone is rightfully offended by you...wat), while the messes that you claim to be so ""small"" at Libe accumulate to a disgusting degree. What might seem trivial to you, accumulates over time. I'd love to see you all be the ones to pick up the mess, back and forth, all day. 

I guess empathy isn't something that was fed to you through your silver spoons. 

Also, learn how to use satire properly. Satire can't be used if you're trying to be an asshole. It's used if you want to change a structural problem that's held in place by ignorance (so joke's on you).

I hate having feelings, honestly. I wish I didn't have feelings for other people. Even when someone explicitly expresses feelings for me, I feel so hesitant to have feelings for them in return. I can't have feelings for people; I'm way too scared of getting hurt."

I can't stop lying to my parents. I really wish I could but I just want to make them stop worrying & to keep the good image of me that they have. Recently, though, they've started to unravel my lies. I want to be honest with them, really I do, but I'm scared that if I'm honest with them, they'll disown me."
1667,2015-10-07 15:58:41,"6383

I do have friends, I laugh everyday, and I am quite optimistic. It's not that I am depressed, it's just that I haven't defined myself yet. Too often, I find myself easily slipping into different personas when I'm around different people or in different circumstances. It's like I haven't decided which version of myself to be. I'm not sure why that is, but frankly I'm tired of the uncertainty and self-doubt.

From this day on, I will be best version of myself because nobody could ever do that. For the record, I'm truly sorry that I disgust you, but normal doesn't exist."
1669,2015-10-07 15:19:45,"6381
I keep getting pressured to try to go out and hookup with girls, my guy friends keep saying its part of the college experience but I don't get it. I don't know what to do."

Yea, that was me. You seemed angry, afraid, annoyed, disgusted, or maybe you didn't notice/recognize me at all. Sorry for that confession. Whether you believe it or not, a different person posted that, not me. As in, a different, stupider version of myself. So yea, even though I don't think about you or that post AT ALL anymore, I can imagine how you might have felt seeing me in the flesh. Especially on the small steps leading to West, in such an intimate space, without enough time for either of us to pretend like we don't see the other (me to spare you the stress and you out of an understandable aversion towards me). Anyway, you don't have to forgive me. I'll be alright, and I'm sure you'll be able to forget about me easily in time. Hoping it happens sooner rather than later, for your sake not mine."
1671,2015-10-07 00:20:49,"6379
I gave in and said it first, but I need to know that it's real. I need to know that you won't push me away. Because while I would still succeed without you, having you with me makes the journey and the victory even better."

I wait patiently until I think no one's on our hall before I leave my room. I do the same thing once I'm done in the bathroom. I think I have an asocial disorder but you'd never know it the way I smile, greet, and talk to you if I actually do see you."
1673,2015-10-06 21:11:52,"6377
I have horrible anxiety. It stops me from doing my work, because I just become so obsessed with my worry. Logically I know I'm being dumb, but I just can't help it. I don't want to talk to anyone, because I don't want to burden them. It's gotten so much worse this year."

I was sitting near a group of kids in Becker who were talking about Avatar: the Last Airbender, AKA the greatest show of all time. Something about an allegory between Jesus and Zuko. Sounded interesting, and I wanted to inquire or at least sit a bit closer so I could hear exactly what was being said, but I knew they wouldn't have been receptive to some random stranger. I wish I could have approached them without consequence. Why do people think gregariousness is creepy. Too bad..."

I want to think that my life is perfect. I have a high GPA, various extracurricular activities, tons of work experience in my field, a good number of friends, and most importantly, a girlfriend who would do anything for me. Yet, I am still worried. I still go to bed every night depressed and thinking that my future is going to be complete crap. Many people would trade their life for mine in a heartbeat, but I hate my life. I've created such high expectations for myself that I just can't live up to them. Some nights I ask myself why I can't be happy with an A- and why I'm killing myself to get an A/A+. I just want this all to stop... The pressure is just way too much."
1677,2015-10-06 19:27:57,"6373
I'm at peace with myself in terms of relationships, but I keep meeting cool people. I'm afraid I will ruin this for myself by pursuing them. Or worse, someone will finally be interested, and I will push them away unintentionally."
1678,2015-10-06 19:59:59,"6372
I wish you were ready for marriage, because we'll be out of here soon and I'd sure as hell prefer to go with you than without you. At the same time, it wouldn't be right to pressure you into anything, and that would defeat the purpose of it in the first place. I just wish we were at the same stage in life, because every single other thing about this relationship is perfect. I hope it doesn't kill me to lose that... (literally)."
1679,2015-10-06 18:00:11,"6371
As much as I like being independent and happy in myself and I know I don't need anyone, it would still be nice for someone to want me. I just want to find a kind and selfless person to share my happiness and joy of simple things with, but also my sense of adventure and amazement at what the world holds. I don't know if I'll find that person at Cornell or not, but it would be nice if this fall, I did. It just seems that everyone I end up liking is never as kind as I think they are. I just want someone who is genuinely kind."

I told my boyfriend that I loved him Thursday night sort of by accident. What he doesn't know is that I’ve been trying to figure out the perfect way to tell him for a few weeks now. Fingers crossed that he actually feels the same way and wasn't just saying it."
1681,2015-10-06 18:23:15,"6369
There is this guy that I really like. When I hang out with him we get along so well and I get the feeling that he likes me too. But on days I don't see him I don't hear anything from him at all. I can see on Facebook when he was last online and what events he is attending so I can basically cluster together his life but I would so much prefer him telling me what he is up to. It is really frustrating to see the difference between personal and internet communication, it's like I'm talking to a different person."
1682,2015-10-06 18:04:16,"6368
I love a girl but hesitate to tell her cause I don’t feel I deserve her. But I just can’t concentrate on my study because of constantly thinking of her. I am not sure what part of her captures me and I just don’t think she would say yes because we don’t really meet each other much."

I've been depressed for three years. It all started back in 2012 when I was on the basketball team. We had just won our regional championship, but our opponents wouldn't have it. After the game, they came to the locker room and started up trouble, beating our entire team with their fists. My friend took the biggest hits, and still has the scars on his face to prove it. That fight changed me. I stopped eating, I couldn't sleep, and I couldn't get myself up in the morning. After a few months, my mom sent me to her wealthy brother's house across the country. She hoped that maybe I'd get back to the happy and friendly person I'd been in the past, but it didn't work. I'm an Ivy League student who can't get themselves out of the bed in the morning, all because of a single fight."

Just ended my first long-term relationship and it was a lot harder than I expected. I can't help but wonder whether or not I made the right decision. At least it didn't end on bad terms. I'm so broken-hearted."
1686,2015-10-06 14:40:21,"6364
I broke up with him for a few different reasons, but the main one being that I wanted to explore once I transferred and I felt like being in a relationship would hold me back a little. I feel really selfish because of this but I feel like I needed to do this for me. I care about him so much and it breaks my heart to know that he still loves me."
1687,2015-10-06 10:13:22,"6363
I've been tempted to cheat on my girlfriend several times recently. Some really good looking, smiling and smart girls have shown interest on me (like 3 over the last 2 months). Don't get me wrong, I know when I am in the friendzone or not. Sigh... although I politely avoid them, they send me random texts, fb messages... I'll keep my loyalty to my gf. I pray every day to avoid doing something wrong. I was cheated on by another gf and I don't wish this to anyone."

I love Cornell and I've loved all the people I've met here thus far these last couple years. However, one thing I'll never understand is how lightly people take sex here. It's to the point where being a virgin is seen as a ""bad thing that they want to get over with..."" 

To play devil's advocate, I've heard people raise the argument, ""I have to find my sexual compatibility..."" While I understand the concern, this notion isn't only an attempt to justify sleeping around, but also has been proven incorrect by many psychologists, marriage and family experts, and therapists. Other such studies, including a few here at Cornell, have shown that sex early on in relationships (including hookups) leads to sexual dissatisfaction later in life. Sex is the action that created me, and you who is reading this post. Sex is as intimate as you can get with someone and the cultural notion that it can be ""casual"" is alarming to me for the future of our society. Gone are the days of dating and getting to know people for who they are at heart. Instead, culturally we have an unsaid ""sport"" of analyzing how a variety of people perform in bed, encouraged by alcohol and other decision-impairing drugs. 

I know people are going to dismiss this post deeming it as ""puritanical"" and ""outdated"" but this is the only place where my opinion can be heard. What I'm saying isn't anything religiously affiliated or targeting a specific gender, race, and/or age group. I'm not a ""sex police"" who goes out of my way to judge and condemn others for their choices, but I consistently face opposition for MY personal choice. 

I know that despite being in a minority, I'm not the only person who feels this way and unfortunately those who have opinions opposing mine, are not very open to how I feel."
1691,2015-10-05 22:45:34,"6359
So many things I wanted to say. So many things I wanted to do. Did I hold back too much and let our time slip away? Or did I move too fast and wash our memories down the drain..."

I used to be good at school and, when I needed it, I also used to be good at faking my confidence in my abilities.

I just want to know what you thought of me this whole time. I'm not here anymore and you texted me that you'd miss me but I was too scared, like always, to show my true emotions to you. Please try again. Please. I want to tell you that I loved every minute I spent with you, even though it was just for a year, even though we never tried to be anything more than casual friends. I just want to know if you thought of me as a good friend, if you trusted me with yourself. I don't care if you didn't have romantic feelings for me, which was never the point. I just wish I knew that you valued me. I hope you'll forgive me for being too weak to tell you my feelings when you gave me the chance. I regret it so much."
1694,2015-10-05 22:36:38,"6356
You have so many preconceptions about me that it’s funny. You know nothing about me yet act so understanding and informed; you don't know so many things. I do enjoy your company and understand my place in your life that I won't butt in where I don't belong. I could say everything you say about me back to you and it would still make sense. I don't act enlightened, but keep an open mind with scrutiny; the image of me in your mind had only been tainted by your own thoughts."

My neocortex and my amygdala truly despise each other. When emotion takes over, I know exactly what's going on and how long it'll last and what the effect will be, and how pointless it is, but alas reason can't prevail and my neocortex is helpless to do anything about it. Whether it's rejection or embarrassment, or a low grade, the refractory period has to occur no matter what. Physical attraction is the same struggle. My neocortex wants to have perfectly normal intellectual conversations with attractive women the same way I have them with guys, i.e. only focusing on the words that are spoken, but no -- I have to think about how hot they are. It's honestly not a choice. It's like science vs. religion is happening in my head."

I have thought of keeping a distance and tried not to lead you on. But I am so selfish that I keep looking for you when I am lonely. I had a crush on your best friend, but somehow I have become so dependent on you. I never thought that we could become anything but friends. But recently I feel like I enjoy the chemistry between us, even without a committed relationship. I would become jealous when some other girls get close to you. But I am not sure that if I like you. I am not read to commit to a relationship, not to say that I have a crush on someone else. You are a really nice and sweet guy. I care about you so much but I can never become your girlfriend. I should keep some distance from you. But I don't want to lose you as a friend. Can we just stay in this ambiguous relationship? Please do not fall in love with me. I am a really selfish person, and you are too nice for me."

It's so funny to me. In the past week, five different girls I know have either rescheduled/cancelled a get-together or brought someone else without any prior warning. Back when I was a dummy who fell in love too quickly and made poor decisions too often and read into everything too much and tried too hard without ever even asking anyone out on a legitimate date, this would have been a shitty time, and I would have had an illogical anger for these girls--my FRIENDS, who did nothing wrong at all. It's so funny to me who I used to be, and I know there are some poor guys out there who are still like me, though probably not nearly as bad because I was one of the all-time WORST when it comes social adeptness, reading signs, and pursuing a relationship. I really did NOT see things clearly, or understand these matters AT ALL. Not saying I'm an expert now, but I'm at peace, and I'm so much more difficult to upset these days, and I suddenly understand so much more. And I'm happy, and I'm confident, and I'm at ease. This is truly wonderful."

I am terrified that I am this close to losing my shit. I thought graduation would improve things because I wasn't happy at Cornell even though I so desperately wanted to be. But things just seem to be getting worse and worse: every party now involves me drinking till I black out and making out with anything and everything that would have me. If I could kill myself, I would, but I am terrified of failing in an attempt to die and the pain that would involve. I feel like there are so many things swimming in my head and no way to sort through all of this. I have a thousand plans and thousand lists of things to do, but I never get them done. And now, for all practical purposes, I am alone because I don't want to be a burden on my friends anymore, and it scares the crap out of me! :-("

It's so easy to feel bad about oneself, especially here in a place where so many people seem to be excelling in all aspects of their lives.  Don't compare and stop caring about what others think.  No matter what you are doing, IT MATTERS.  You don't have to be helping source clean water in Africa or designing a revolutionary, new power system to live a meaningful life.  As long as you do your best at whatever it is you do, that is what's truly important."
1708,2015-10-05 02:43:59,"6342
I realized something really important today.  I don't respect myself. I don't respect my inner talent and/or the hard work it took to get here. And I hate those who respect or love me, because, deep down i don't know, I think I hate myself.  I feel like a fraud. So instead of sorting it out, I push people away, so that I can spare them the pain they'd feel if they tried to reach out to me.  I guess that is what people mean when you're surrounded by this inner darkness. Because no matter what choices you make, your darkness emits out of you like some catastrophically enormous black cloud."

I feel like I'm starting to realize that my friends all secretly hate me.

I've been going through a kind of rough time lately. My family back home is falling apart. I feel like I have to suddenly be everyone's rock; perhaps now I'm cracking. I don't know if that's made me somehow act out in ways that have made me easier to dislike. Maybe it's a coincidence.

A friend of mine went on a whole rant about how much I suck about a week ago. Ever since then, there's been this weird, bubbling tension between us. Another friend said that I piss them off every time I open my mouth. I realize I'm kind of the common denominator in this situation. I know that I'm not always the easiest person to get along with. I guess I can be kind of argumentative. I just feel really tired.

It's just been kind of tough. I don't feel like I'm getting a lot of support. I guess I should probably just ask them what I do that pisses me off. I just feel raw inside. What happened to the times where we made each other stronger? Did they ever exist? I wish I knew."

After attending a discussion series tonight, I've come to the sad realization that in considering child care options for when I do have my children, after my maternity leave from work I could never let my mother care for my children the way my grandmother did for me. My mother has some major emotional/psych issues that she doesn't recognize and won't seek help for. Simultaneously I don't know how I feel about having a nanny or a stranger care for my baby. It all seems so complicated now. My whole future seems so depressing regarding this. Who knows if I'll even be able to have kids because of this. Hopefully my future husband's mom/family is kind and sane. If not I have no clue what's gonna happen or if my children will have the privilege of enjoying their grandparents. :("

But I am just always fucking tired and depressing that I just shut myself out from the rest of the world. I will just have to suck it up and go study again.

I thought when I joined my sorority it would help my social status and while I've gotten great friends, still no romance. Technically I know I'm cute, but subjectively I don't know."

All I've been doing this semester is work, and I haven't been keeping in touch with my old friends at all. Honestly though, none of them have noticed because they all have busy lives as well. It hurts that I've basically lost my friends, since whenever they go out and do something on the weekends, I'm always busy with something that can't be put off anymore. I feel so alone in this enormous world."

I'm starting to run out of friends who I can chat when I'm terrified, because I'm pretty sure I've bothered so many of them too many times already.

I'm a TA for a class. When I go to our staff sessions on Tuesdays, I feel like most of the people there hate me.

I'm almost 20 years old and my parents call me anywhere from 30-50 times a week. They know that I am really busy here all the time, I really don't have time or energy to spend 45 minutes a day talking to them on the phone, but they won't let up. I try to text them daily and let them know that I'm doing okay, but that's not enough. Even when I do give in and answer, they'll continue to call me throughout the day as if we didn't just have an extensive conversation. I love them to death, but it really stresses me out that they expect me to constantly communicate with them. I'm worried it'll be like this for the rest of my life."

I don't know if you know this but I have the biggest crush on you. Probably since sophomore year since you asked me to watch your stuff. We are seniors now and I just can't help think about if I had gone for it and told you. I always try to look away when you are walking by because I feel like if I stare I'll give myself away or look creepy. I'm not going to say anything because I never do. And I suspect that you wouldn't say yes because you are not that type of girl. My friends always tell me I should go for it and talk to you but it's not that easy. So, I guess what I'm trying to say is just stay awesome."

To 6316:

I understand where you are coming from. I lost a very good friend to suicide in high school and her death was traumatizing for a very long time. I was afraid to love another person, girl or boy, in a romantic way or not because I was hypersensitized to death and how easily it can come at any moment to anyone. I wore a mask for a long time and chose quantity oover quality to avoid developing too deep of a connection with people. It is really hard to come to terms with this but you have to learn to live in the moment and be grateful for every interaction you have/had with others. 

Love is not qualified by the amount of time you get to spend with someone, whether it is returned, or whether they are still in your life to continue it with you. It just is a thing that happens and will continue to happen if you push for it and enjoy the feeling of bonding it brings. Do not get hard bent on forever when you have the beauty of moment that you are in right now. 

I recommend looking into Neil Pasricha, he has both a ted talk and a really cool book about this. And if you ever need a song to remind you of the small good things in a moment, try Farrah Fawcet hair by capital cities.
It's a long process with loud growing pains but I promise you, with the right mindset you'll come to acceptance."

I am sorry that we have drifted apart. There were good times, and there were bad times. However, I cannot stand you and your obsession over that guy anymore. I am tired and I do not want to help you since you refuse to listen to me. You keep insisting I do not know how you feel even though I am going through the same post-breakup thing. Let me tell you this, I live, and so do you. Stop being dramatic! I am here to support you, but I am not here to be dragged in your mess. We all have good days and bad days, just don't only come to me on the bad days.

Am I bitter? Absolutely. I did not complain to you when I have problems. I did not treat you like a dumpster either. But you, dear friend, you did!

I don't hate you. I still care for you. If there is anything happening to you, I will be one of the first people jumping out there to support you. I just hope you understand my perspective.

Reading confessions on here about people being 20-21-year old virgins and thinking that is embarrassing or terrible or exceptional... It's not. I'm a graduate student. I had my first kiss at 26. And I lost my virginity at 30. It's pretty pathetic, no question about it. But I've had a pretty good life nevertheless and since I actively started dating, I've had... plenty of experience. So I don't really think of my 20s as wasted in that regard. I was focused on other things. So don't be alarmed, it's not a big deal at all. That being said, social life and dating is just as important a part of college as studying and working. I wish someone had told me that. The longer you wait, the more it'll weigh on you, so I'd recommend just getting out there and trying your luck sooner rather than later -- it's an integral part of human existence for better or worse and if you deprive yourself of it, you will suffer psychological repercussions, which will carry over to others aspects of your life.

If it's not happening for whatever reason, definitely DO NOT overthink it. And if you think no one wants you, as I did -- you're wrong. You're a virgin because of something you're doing, not because people aren't attracted to you. I thought the latter, and once I actually started trying, I found out a lot of girls liked me. My self esteem is much higher now b/c of that -- you may think that's superficial, but that's just how humans are. Nothing can bring your confidence up like attention from the opposite sex. Dates are an excellent mode of interaction b/c people express interest in each other, so it's mutually beneficial, even if it doesn't lead anywhere. And confidence is one of the most useful things to have, that unfortunately you have to get thru an organic means, you cannot manufacture it in your brain artificially. So get out there and get some attention!"

I really hope you don't actually hate me. I only stopped talking to you in all but a wistful way because I had liked you a lot for many months but never felt good enough for you; I never told you how I felt. Suffice it to say you made me feel amazing whenever we hung out together and I really miss how you made me felt, and I miss you. I tried my best to hide my feelings for you but I realized it would probably be healthier to just distance myself from you. I'm sorry but I hope you understand. You'll make some guy very happy one day."

Lately I've been feeling very lonely after coming here.

5 years ago, I was miraculously saved in a car accident but I observed my girlfriend dying on the very spot. False rumor spread that I abused her, and I had to transfer. The other friend in that car died 2 yrs after the crash after being in vegetative state, and another friend of mine who I trusted the most died of leukemia. What's worse is that so many people not believe this when I gather a tremendous amount of courage to speak about it. Now, I am scared to date girls even though I like them because I am afraid that I will lose them like I did before and also that I feel guilty of liking someone else.  I have always lived like a clown with a fake mask, trying to be goofy and weird to cover up the sadness.
Now that I am here, it feels even worse as most of my friends are back in south, and I have a hard time making new friends ever since I was framed. The girl I like back in my hometown doesn't even reply back to me. I would have committed suicide long ago if it wasn't the tremendous expectations my family had in me, but I feel so lonely and sometimes I want to cry."

I am afraid to drive, but I am also scared that if I tell anyone or anyone finds out they will think I am a loser. :/ I always avoid driving anywhere with friends and always ask them to provide a ride because I am embarrassed to tell them I have a license and can't drive. I don't know what to do I ran into a curb and destroyed my tire once and never went to drive again since I got my license in 12th grade. I suck at life and I am just a worthless loser. I never will find a significant other either because they will laugh at me that I cannot drive or that I suck at driving. For instance, I can drive on slow roads but I am afraid of the thruway or turnpike because there are so many trucks and you have to drive fast. If the speed limit is 45 or 65 everyone is flying at 20 miles over and they would honk at me for driving slow. I am a living nightmare."

I read Confession #6306 and even though I'm only a freshman I'm already really pissed off at Cornell too (the gov department).  I took AP US Gov & Politics and AP Comparative Government & Politics and got 5's on both of them, expecting to place out of the gov intro classes. Of course, the year that I come to Cornell they change its policies so I absolutely have to take the intro classes. So I enroll myself in Intro to US Gov GOVT 1111 and I absolutely hate it. For someone passionate about politics and government, I find intro to US gov horrifically boring, redundant, and makes me hate my major so far. ""The national government reigns supreme to the states"" echoed through the lecture hall for 2 weeks. ""Blacks are more likely to be democrats"". No shit. For students who already want to pursue a major and has already had high scores on AP/IB classes that clearly cover the intro material, just let us move on. I'm paying thousands of dollars to read the same textbook I used in high school, forced to sit through information I already know."

In response to #6307

   My heart was strained the moment I saw this post. I had to stop every work at hand and walk around impetuously to mitigate the pain. But I couldn’t. The pain keeps gripping my heart and my head is suffocated. I can’t stop thinking: what if it’s you? And I decided that I have to write a response, even though it’s possible that on the other side of a computer sits a complete stranger, disappointed over a confusing response from an undesired man, while you, who have dominated my mind since we met, is watching the drama unfold with a bag of popcorn in hand. 

   I like your sheer life energy and your innocent joy. Whenever I see you and talk to you, I feel like there’s a child miraculously preserved in your heart. Often, when I walk around this campus, I feel I’m a little child walking amidst a bunch of scary, grown up college students, so whenever I’m by your side, I feel happy and secure. I think that’s why overtime, my feeling for you grew stronger and stronger, until it developed into a kind of attachment that I had never imagined before, completely different from the immature, teenage attractions. 

   Now, you talk about your being depressed, and you think nobody would want to be in a relationship with you. To be honest, although I was never sure, I had always been contemplating if there is such darkness deep inside your heart. That’s why I felt skeptical when you kept me away. But at that time, I also thought maybe I was overthinking, maybe you really didn’t like me, so it’s better for me to retreat to my own world. But not for a second had I thought about getting away from you because of that potential darkness. Especially after reading this post, I realized that so long as you are miserable, I cannot feel happy. And how can I give less shit to some god damned “normal girl”? Do I look like a sane, normal person? All I want is you to be happy!

   If it is indeed you who wrote this post, I think you may recognize me. If it’s someone else, I sincerely apologize for the trouble I made. I’m a fool in such matters, so it might take some time for me to figure out what I should do. But I want you to know that I’m here, and will always be."

I'm a non-traditional student here. I'm an undergraduate in my mid-20's. Needless to say, it's really hard to make friends. There are plenty of people who approach me wanting to be friends, but then it always gets to an awkward turning point. Most scenarios with girls go something like: ""Are you in a sorority?"" ""No."" ""Really? Why Not?"" ""I'm in my mid-20s."" Most scenarios with guys go something like: *Guy flirts a lot* ""You know, I'm in my mid-20s."" And that's that. I hope there are people here (undergraduate or otherwise) who wouldn't be completely weirded out being friends with someone in their mid-20s."

I've been depressed since long before I came to Cornell. Sometimes I just want to quit everything and run away but I can't. I feel trapped and I haven't felt anything close to happiness in a long long time. If you knew me, you probably wouldn't recognize me from this. As a matter of fact, I have friends, I laugh everyday and I might be one of the most optimistic people that you know . But only I know, deep down, I'm lost. I have a disgusting habit that I use to get away from everything but it damages my health, adds to my depression and makes me feel horrible about myself. I can't find interest in anything. All I do everyday is wandering around thinking about how much I hate myself. 
I get upset and self-destructive because of the stupidest thing. For example, there's this guy that I like, but I never had the courage to initiate a meaningful discussion. Whenever I see him gets close or flirty with a girl I would turn to my habit and waking up the next morning swearing that I had to change, but I never did.
I know nobody would want to be in a relationship with someone like me and tbh I don't think I could keep myself together if I am hurt by someone I love one more time. So I guess I should just sit around, keep hating myself and watching him being taken by some girl that is far more normal than me. I kinda brought it on myself, so I guess I deserve to be miserable anyway."

From my direct observations of other students and having read some recent confessions, I have to conclude Cornell University as a school has failed us (the students) in many ways. When we were in high school, most if not all of us worked our butts off to go to a school like Cornell. Why? Because of the connections to be made here, the networking opportunities, because of the doors that the Cornell name can open - there are many other schools with great teachers and research, but with prestige and an alumni network like Cornell, I see many students entering feeling very confident about their job prospects. They try to come here because it means future job security, or goal security (eg better likelihood getting into law school, etc). This I completely understand, as I was the same way in high school. 

However, as a senior I can see that Cornell, quite honestly, fails in the department of supporting its students in need. Sure we have career fairs, we have Career Services, we have that alumni network. But I see so many students who have performed decently here competing desperately with other students to snag spots at big companies or even just jobs in their field. Career Services often gives advice that students who have done their hard work and research already know. It should be simple at a place like this to talk to Career Services and have students quickly hooked up with multiple alumni that have openings in their companies, or collaborators with the university, etc. Networking events should be about students getting jobs and internships, not hundreds of students desperately clawing for 2-3 jobs with the majority of them turned away. I of course understand that the most prestigious and high-paying jobs will always be reclusive, even among elite students, but the fact that so many Cornellians are unemployed or can't find work in their field is just sad, and it's sad that the university barely lifts a finger to help.  A professor recently told me, ""I believe that if a student can't find a job for at least 6 months after graduation (not for lack of trying), they should be reimbursed their tuition."" Obviously it's not feasible, but I would LOVE to see the effects of that on Cornell because it would force the school to pick up the slack. I see plenty hard working students, undergraduate and graduate alike, left in the dust by Cornell because there is no reliable system to help students having a hard time in finding work. 

Furthermore, Cornell doesn't really have a system in place for helping students reliably achieve their goals. I've found students are supposed to flounder about when trying to figure out how to eventually land that great industry job after graduation, know exactly what's needed to get into medical schools (since GPA and MCAT isn't all of it), or graduate school. Instead it's sort of a wishy washy deal where they will give you vague advice if you seek it, and most of it is poor. (For example, I have wanted to enter a Ph.D. program directly after undergraduate since I was a freshman but was told multiple times to wait to start research until the end of sophomore year...possibly some of the worst advice I've ever been given and followed considering research is the #1 importance for graduate admission). Another one of my friends had to figure out on her own that hiring from the internship pool is one of the most reliable ways to work at a large company. Yes it might seem obvious to many of us, but it's not so obvious to a young student who doesn't understand connections are everything nowadays. Because students aren't given the proper advice and guidance they are apt to make mistakes, and with mistakes come failed goals and unemployed alumni (since Cornell doesn't do anything to help students or make connections for those who made such blunders). 

Both these problems show that Cornell, essentially, doesn't care about its students as they are guideless and left to fend for themselves once it comes to leave the university. Nor does it properly prepare many students for their future aspirations. Thus, my opinion stands - Cornell has fundamentally failed its students."

I don't think I'm suitable for the working life. For some reason, I just can't get through interviews. I'm an engineering student with almost 4.0 gpa, I consider myself pretty well-rounded and sociable, I'm competitive and always try to stay at the top of the class, but I just feel so insecure and inadequate when I'm interviewing. I guess that has affected my performance and I just keep getting denied. Getting a summer internship was a huge struggle, and here I am again, being interviewed every single day in the past week for a full-time job and no offers so far. I just feel so incompetent and dumb, it could be that I just haven't found anyone with whom I just ""clicked"" or perhaps I'm just good in figuring out how to pass exams.."

It's really easy to feel lonely here, but my biggest challenge has been getting over the external blaming of the environment for that and trying to take control of the situation myself. Last year I spent all my time with two people, but both of them aren't in my life anymore so I'm trying to meet new people. I've tried clubs and all of that, and while I think I'm outgoing and make connections easy, I haven't really made any good friends. Would it be weird to post on a Cornell page (not anonymously) just honestly saying that I would love to meet new people and if anyone wants to make a new friend, we should meet for coffee. I know the answer is yes, but I also know that I shouldn't care. I figure as long as I stay myself and treat people well, and try to meet new people, it'll all turn out well. We'll see."

I'm a freshman and I'm disappointed with Cornell so far. Don't get me wrong. The people are lovely. The campus is stunning. But the education I'm currently receiving doesn't seem to have a positive correlation with the 60k I'm paying. I don't know, maybe it's because moving here from South Korea, I expected so much more from America's higher education system. Sometimes, during lectures, I just think to myself, ""Why the fuck am I paying money to learn from these unmotivated professors who clearly don't give a shit about undergraduate education?"" I know there are some professors who are very enthusiastic and inspirational. But they seem to constitute the minority. In my intro to stats lecture, the professor literally read word for word from the textbook. Did I travel across the globe to hear this shit? Where the fuck is my money going to? To pay for audio recordings of textbook readings? I'm just so frustrated. I could easily learn more from the free lectures posted on khanacademy."

He tells me that he wants to register as a Democrat but he is worried that his family and coworkers will disapprove - it's been more than 2 years and he has graduated already. I wonder if he is lying to me"

I am such a worthless loser leech and piece of crap. I can't find a job even after graduating from Cornell. I still live with my parents eating their food, and utilizing their house and utilities. I'm a parasitic worm that's destroying the apple which they call their house by living at home. I wish that a car ran me over when I was a student at Cornell, that way I could have saved them the money they wasted on a worthless piece of garbage that I am. I polished my resume, I polished my cover letters writing a personalized one for each job, and I applied following all the rules Cornell Career Services gave me, including for interviews before I graduated. I don't know what's wrong with me. I have always been rejected all my life for a lot of things. I think Cornell made a mistake accepting me as I am an embarrassment to this Ivy League school as I will never be able to give back to society. I can't even find a temporary job serving coffee at Starbucks, since I applied for at 3 local branches and got denied, with the manager telling me that I am overqualified for the position and that I looked ""depressed."" I feel hopeless. I'm just a waste of space, wishing that I can disappear. Every day I dream I could just vanish into thin air without anyone recognizing me. I think if that happened, no one I knew from Cornell would even notice, as everyone moved on after graduation. I feel lonely sitting at home getting scolded by my parents how I ""am just a worthless piece of crap who can't find a job after Cornell."" I've gotten to the point where I don't care if I will be poor and homeless as long as I could have some dignity by having a low-skilled labor job to be able to talk to people, make friends, leave the house without being embarrassed by former high school classmates about not having a job after graduating ""such a prestigious school,"" and earn some money to eventually move out of poverty from student loans, etc. I know people will say I am insane, which I probably am, but I have been fighting many demons throughout my life so please don't judge me."

Someone posted about kissing after a first date, and I thought I would share my own experience -- don't do it. I tried it a few times and it worked out rather well. But this one time, I wasn't 100% sure it would be the right move, but I did it anyway -- and the girl just turned her head and said ""No..."" and walked away... Not in a mean way, I think she said ""Thank you though"" or something to that effect as she was walking away from me, but it was really awkward and I was embarrassed. It's just not a risk worth taking and I agree with the other poster that it sends the wrong message. Especially if you really like the girl -- get to know her first, wait until the 2nd or even the 3rd date, regardless of the vibe you get from her. Even if you don't care too much what happens -- still refrain from it. It's just too forward, it's bad mannered, it's too risky. Don't do it period is my advice. It's a small campus and you don't want the awkwardness of running into each other after something like that."

There was a post on here about income taxes previously. I have the same sentiment - why does the government deserve nearly 60% of my income every year? In the past 7 years or so my federal went from 35 to 39.6%, capital gains from 15 to 28%, no more deductions for charitable contributions or anything else, and now all of the government healthcare taxes. 

I do NOT deserve to work for 40 cents out of every dollar I make so that the government can get into even more massive debt and spend it away on stupid programs and wars"

I didn't just Google this, I used to study social disorders and I remember throughout the relationship feeling uncomfortable because it crossed my mind a few times.

When women use the ""I'm not sure I'm ready/want to date"" excuse after a first date -- while I think it's very polite and very much appreciate their letting me know and considering my feelings -- don't get me wrong ladies, I get it and you're not doing anything wrong. But just from a logical point of view -- how does that argument make sense? You went on a date. It's like getting a job offer after an interview and saying -- ""you know, I'm not sure I'm ready to work""..."

It's so easy to feel bad about oneself, especially here in a place where so many people seem to be excelling in all aspects of their lives.  My advice, don't compare and stop caring about what others think.  No matter what you are doing, IT MATTERS.  You don't have to be helping source clean water in Africa or designing a revolutionary, new power system to live a meaningful life.  As long as you do your best at whatever it is you do, that is what's truly important."

It's truly a beautiful and romantic feeling, in and of itself, to have someone break up with you and with each passing day you fall less for them and more for yourself...You slowly forgive every thing wrong in the relationship and you start realizing that you'll love again and more intensely.......Even though you don't realize you were wrong, I forgive you. :)"

Because I am dumb. Because I did not think. Because I did not see you were the only girl to ever love/ care for me in my life. I will never find another girl that meant as much to me as you do for the rest of my time at Cornell. I love you and always will continue to love you even though you hate me."

To the girl on the 3rd floor I met last year: I've always known that you were drawn to me, and I was (and still am) drawn to you as well. I, too, wish that I had said something early on. But it's not too late. If you know where to look for me, then you'll find me, and I'll be waiting for you."

I'm a very independent person and I have no problem doing things by myself. But I'm looking for a partner to experience life with, to laugh with, and to pass the time with. It seems unfair to me that so many others are given this precious privilege while I am left to wonder what I'm doing wrong.

I don't need someone but I very much want a partner in my life, and it is a unique situation in that there's nothing I can do about it. The lack of control upsets me. Normally when I want something there is a clear pathway for me to get it. I wanted to get into a good college, so I studied harder. I wanted to lose weight, so I worked out more. There is no linear pathway here and I don't know what to do except just continue to live my life. But I've done that for two years here now, and I'm still alone..."

It took me 9 years to hit the bottom and realize I'm a sex addict. I was at Cornell until 2 years ago and during those 4 years as graduate student, I was spending 5 to 6 hours a day watching porn, chatting with strangers, and browsing the craigslist, masturbating behind my office desk and pool's locker rooms. I was Slope day staff that provided me more opportunity to act out. Last year, I hit the bottom and I had storm in my life. Since then, I go to sex addict anonymous meetings 3 times a week and therapy sessions once in a week. I have been sober for 14 months now and I live one day at a time."

I am an international student just out of grad school; I got a job at one of those brand-name tech firms but I am still not able to work due to a delay on my work authorization paperwork. Americans don’t even know what kind of stuff we face.  We get into Cornell, get the job and still have to go through all the paperwork. The delay is very stressful. I’m running out of money and I’ll have to start paying back the student loan soon. 
It really sucks. I finally got my tax returns from the summer internship and it gave me a few more weeks to survive. I call USCIS (immigration services) and they are not very warm in saying that there is nothing they can do about it.

Here is the timeline if anyone is interested.

Jul/2014: Got returning offer from the summer
Oct/2014: Got offer from another firm, accepted. Start date: JULY 2015
Mar/2015: applied for OPT (recent grad work authorization)
May/2015: graduated! Yay!
Jul/2015: OPT rejected (I-20 document is 31 days old. Maximum limit is 30 days - the letter arrived on the 30th day)
Jul/2015: Reapplied
Jul/2015: Start date postponed
Aug/2015: OPT accepted YAY. Initial estimate to authorization arrive: 7-10 days

It has been 20 days so far and nothing. I tried to call the government agency (USCIS) and they told me to wait up to 60 days. Wait, what?

Before I submit this, I should say that I don't go to Cornell anymore. I've transferred as a way to escape my past and start a fresh life. My life was hell. From the outside I seemed fine, but inside I was at a place that not many people understand. In the spring semester I attempted suicide twice. I'm not writing this so that you feel bad for me. I'm writing this so that you understand that I'm alive. 

I was in a deep, dark depression, one that I thought that I could never escape. Yeah, I occasionally still have relapses, but that's just like anything. I did, however, escape, and I found a new purpose in life. I'm not a religious person, and don't necessarily believe in a higher power, but I do believe in purpose. Last night, in my new life far, far away from Ithaca, I talked a kid down from suicide. You have no idea how much this one single moment justified all the hell I experienced. Every night crying into my pillows, feeling the self pity of not being good enough, watching my life crumble before my eyes; all of that suddenly became worth it for this one kid. If I didn't go through hell and back, maybe he wouldn't be here today. That makes it all worthwhile.

I'm telling you this because somewhere at Cornell, right now, there is someone like the old me, considering or attempting suicide. You can beat it and find your purpose in life, too.

*Also, if you or someone you know is struggling with suicidal thoughts, please please please call the National Suicide Prevention Hotline at (800)273-8255 or the Gannett Suicide Prevention line at (607)272-1616. You may remain anonymous.*"

Okay. I will say something...

My entire life I have always been comfortable with my body. I haven't had anything or anyone that makes me question whether I want to look differently just to ""fit in"". But ever since I discovered that I have a thing for men (I struggled with sexual orientation mostly; dated girls only), I decided to get the app many gays get: Grindr. My life hasn't been great after I got Grindr. Guys there expect you be either a twink or someone very muscular; it sucks. Also, as I am very inexperienced, many guys pressure me to either hook up with them so they can be my ""first"" or are rather not interested. I know it's a hook up app but is there an app for beginners?

Going back to the typical body that a guy must have to be successful with guys on Grindr, it makes me sad when I constantly get rejected. I have been successful with girls before and they never minded my body... mainly because I have other traits that balance out the equation at the end. What I have seen is that those traits don't really matter for guys on Grindr. If you don't have an amazing body, they go like ""do you have big C?"". I usually don't answer those questions because it's very shitty to like someone for just one thing. So I rather just stop talking to that person. 

The reason I complain about this is that it's very frustrating for me. I want to have fun since I'm in College and I know that after I graduate I will settle but it's hard to have that kind of fun if you are not out and don't have a gay app. As a result, I am hating being gay and I am worried that as a result of that, I end up hating myself. I don't know what to do or who to talk to. I feel like if I ever tell this to anyone, I'd be judged and left out and then everyone would know. I hardly trust anyone so that doesn't help either. 

P.S. I am currently working on my body (not for the assholes on Grindr) but I said this because of those that are different in any other way."

To be honest, I have never been a completely happy person. I have always felt that I am missing something so fundamental, yet I never seem to find quite what it is.

Maybe it is purely coincidence, but I have never held a true relationship either. It seems that every girl I am friends with, I am either the """"gay best friend"""" or else I am that weird nerd guy. One time, I was in a 'relationship,' but only in the weakest sense of the work. I keep hoping, praying even, that I will find someone that I click with, but I seem to be foiled at every turn. My friends make fun of me for it occasionally, and I laugh along (it doesn't bother me much), but there is a part that makes me wonder if there is that missing piece out there.

I have come to terms with the fact that maybe I am just not build for a relationship, but it saddens me. I always try to help others. I always try to make others laugh and smile. I always try to brighten the mood of any given place. Maybe I have too much ego. Maybe I just don't have the confidence. Maybe a whole pile of issues.

Still, why, can't it be me? Why can't I be the fool with the hands held with my best friend, confidante, and partner as we stride across Ho Plaza, not caring about what others think?
I guess there is something about me that doesn't quite work for all of that. Maybe I will figure it out eventually..."

I'm so pathetic! Finally get to spend some 1 on 1 time with the girl I've liked since coming to Cornell, and I'm too much of a wuss to tell her that I like her. This is why I will die alone. *screams internally*"

I graduated from Cornell in 2013. Now, I am unemployed and receiving unemployment benefits. I have been to 5 interviews and they all rejected me. Some of those jobs I interviewed for were internships. The labor market is really tough. I strongly recommend that you guys prepared yourselves by getting internships during your college careers, even if those internships are unpaid."

To the one who wasn't it, let it be known, this is going sound spiteful, but know it's not, its just honest. I'm done with you. On so many levels. I can finally say that and truly mean it. I want nothing to do with you. Romantically, you aren't the same person who was so beautifully strong and open. Your eyes have been distorted, and you are fighting a war that slowly is rotting humanity. That's fine, because like everyone else, you are blind. But unlike everyone else you devour information and act so enlightened, when in reality you are just being dragged around by the powers that be. Your reality is so warped, and it makes me laugh. You fail to truly understand what this world is, just like everyone else, which is so sad since I thought you had so much potential. But that can be forgiven. We all have our flaws. But you just aren't worth my time anymore. To any extent. I won't even waste time burning that bridge, because I rather just walk away and let time hide it. I thought at the minimum we were good friends. I thought there was a level of honesty and openess between us. But you couldn't even tell me to my face, not even as a friend. I thought we were close, but I realized that you so selfishly tried to protect my feelings and hid anything that could have hurt. I'll let you know I'm not hurt. Maybe if I had learned it when my mind was still broken, then so would my heart. But I learned it all when I could breathe without you stepping into my mind. But no matter what it could have done to me, purely as a friend, I deserved to know. But now I understand we were never friends. Just minds that conversed. And for that, I have lost respect in you and want nothing to do with you. I am not a pawn whose emotions you can play with, someone whose admiration you need to keep no matter what the truth was. I came to you so honestly, which such sincerity like never before, and you spat in the face in the one thing I valued most. That's fine with me, since I have found someone beautiful, who makes me happy when I'm with them -not just when I think about them- and I'll give them my whole, because I know they'll do the same for me. You made me realize the one thing I need the most, and the amazingly the next person to step immediately in my life offered it to me so openly. I want loyalty and the truth. You never gave me either. And that's okay. I hope you have a good life. This is the last time I'll think of you, because there is no room for anyone else since they takes so much space in my mind. But that's not because of some stupid idealization that corrupted my sanity, but rather for who she is, because I truly know who that is. 

To the one who makes me so calm it slightly frigthens me, until you, I cursed the time I wasted, but all of that now just makes me truly appreciate that beautiful smile you give me, knowing that you truly care about me just as much as I do for you. And let it be known that your timing couldn't have been better. Any early, and my mind would have been corrupted, unable to fully give you my all, but just as they slipped out, you -someone that honestly deserves to matter- came in. I want to do right by you. I have no eyes for anyone else, because I can trust everything that you are, every word you speak, every step we make. I feel like I can say anything with no fear of the consequences, but you are truly open to who I am, as I am of you. I feel so free being held by you. I smile when I look at you because I have not been this happy in the longest time, and it isn't just because who you are or where I am in my life, but because of who we are together. This feels too right. You don't just check off a list of wants, but rather make my heart with your company. Your essence as a human being. I don't feel forced to make you happy, because doing so just comes so naturally, since all I want is for you to be as happy as I am with you. I dont worry about what I do or say around you, because I know you just want me, imperfections and all. I haven't been this happy in forever, and I am so happy I can bring you the same joy. I never thought I could find someone who could want me as equally as I want them, but here we are, and with such intensity."

Life is complex. One day you may feel on top of the world, and the next day you may be carrying its weight. Through trials and tribulations that I have undergone in my life, I have seen emotions as both vital, and as a hindrance. But there are a few things I have discovered. If you have a dream, go after it. Life may push against you, but you can always push back harder. If you love someone, tell them. It may be hard, you may be scared, but at the end of the day you have to trust yourself and believe in them. And lastly, you have to believe in youself. You can have an entire nation believe in your potential, but if you dont believe in yourself, it doesnt mean a darn thing."

I love everyone. I love everyone I see on this campus. I love those who've given me contemptuous looks or mistreated me, if only because I know that society has allowed them to  build a concrete wall around their mind. I love those who have demonstrated an almost equally great capacity for love, if only because I know that they damage the foundation on which such walls are built. I love everyone in between, if only because I need to reconcile myself with the fact that the world won't yield to me and people will always be people. I love them because someone has to, and because I'm okay with self-righteousness. I'm unashamed of my feeling that my love is unique. 

I don't want to be seen, just heard. I don't want to be famous, just my words. 

I wonder sometimes if I will become renowned someday, then I wonder if the renowned always knew or never wondered. I'm in a strange place of pretentiousness, and I don't know if these feelings are fitting because I will be right or disconcerting because I will be wrong.

Without Cornell, I would not have awoken as the person who writes these words. And yet, with Cornell, I must push through a bunch of nothing to get to nowhere, when I already know where I want to be and what something is for me. A strange dichotomy. 

Or paradox, I should say. I only chose the former word, dichotomy, because it rhymed, sounding wordsmith-like, rhythmic, and perfect. But this second word, paradox, seems more logical. Or irony, even, would work better.

I want to be alone and writing, because I love everyone completely and people bring me only eclectic arrays of thoughts and infinite sadness- a deep sadness rooted in my love, internalized, and somehow expressed to others as a robust happiness and kindness.

I appear to be happy and kind. So people love me. And I am happy in ways allowed by my love, but mostly a masochist when I go out into the world. Not to mention, all love and kindness aside, I am flawed beyond measure and must challenge these flaws. If I can have such terrible thoughts, then what good am I? If I too have a concrete wall, secretly, then how can I profess to be the one who will puncture the walls of others? Can I?

These words have had no structure, and my love will be taken lightly, and I can't save the world because even an immense pool of love will never manifest itself as understanding in the hundreds of pairs of eyes I encounter each day.

And so I love in vain. 

I would be insane by now, if not for art, especially film. To which I must ask:

Why can't there be silence after indulging in good art? Why do people dismiss the moment after surreal, after escape, as quickly as it arrives? Why can't people revel in the post-coital ecstasy following the intercourse between your mind, body, and the screen? Why must people ask me for my thoughts on the film?  I have none. I am at peace. I am at my most free, my most tormented, my most suave, my most hectic, my most calm, my most available, my most reserved, my most loving, my most understanding, my most apathetic, my most infallible, my most complex, my most me. And, only in this resplendent second, can I feel truly brilliant in a way that seems real.

In that moment, during that second, please just leave me be.

Then I leave the theater, or I unplug the headphones, and I see the people, and I think that somehow they will know that I love them then. They will know somehow, right?

And so I love in vain, again. 

And so I love you. I do. I love you. I do. And you don't have to believe a word of what I've said, but I will say once more: I love you. I do. 

I am a black man.

This means something to you, I predict. You had thoughts, good and bad, once I lost my identity as a voiceless human being. Perhaps you even had doubts. But I love you.

And I forgive you too."

I'm the type of girl who likes the simple things in life. Reading a book on a park bench, a cool breeze on a hot day, sunsets out my window, finding a dollar on the sidewalk. I find pleasure in my morning cappuccino, in the light flakiness of an afternoon croissant, in the warmth of freshly copied papers. I like to cook and to nap and to watch cartoons and in general I'm satisfied with that. I go out on the weekends and I kiss boys and I laugh with my friends. But lately, especially as autumn approaches, I really just wish there was someone I could share these small moments with. maybe drink wine on the rooftop and sleep in into the late afternoon."

Based on my limited dating experience so far -- about 12 dates -- I've concluded it's better not to kiss the girl at the end, even if you had a really good time and you got a good vibe from her. If you do, you would generally get a positive reaction and she may even text you first later, but then it's less likely she'll want to see you again after she's had some time to think about it. The dates where I didn't go for it, even if I thought it was appropriate, were all followed by second dates and things generally developed better. I think it may just be a bit too forward or flingy to kiss at the end of the first date, which sends an ambiguous message. That's just my experience -- of course I'm sure there are instances where people kissed and it was great after, but I think the probability is lower she will be interested in seeing you again."

I graduated in May 2014 and I'm still unemployed... I've been to 17 interviews and I never got to a second round. The first few rejections were really dispiriting but since then I've gotten so used to it, I don't really expect anything different and it doesn't hurt when I inevitably don't get the next job. Humans are surprisingly adaptable. I will start looking into low-skilled labor soon. I think I will be happier there. It really goes to show how much our economy has changed. 20 years ago, a college education more or less guaranteed you an office job. Now, an Ivy League degree means nothing on its own.

I saw you waiting for me after section toward the end of the semester, and I knew you were going to ask me out, but I pretended that I didn't notice. 

I was totally into you, and I wanted to dive headfirst into wherever that was going. But I found out you were a senior, and that you were moving away in May. I wanted to remember you as the ""one who got away"" rather than ""that shitty long-distance relationship that didn't even really begin until you left and fizzled out agonizingly slowly.""

But suddenly going from 800 calories a day to 5000 a day by losing control of myself is terrifying. Yes I just ate 4 muffins in a row, yes I'm about to eat as much as I can before I'm doubled over in pain. No, this isn't a white girl's problem. It's hard concentrating in class when all you think about all the time is food. Life for me is just waiting for the next meal. Sometimes I sleep to pass the time until I can eat again.

Dear frat-star,

You're in one of the best/well-known fraternities on-campus and your pictures are always filled with attractive people. But freshman year, you drunkenly came up to me and asked me how I was doing. I was wearing a sweater on a Saturday night and I was definitely not the type of girl you were into, so I didn't know why you even acknowledged me. You talked about how you talked your friend out of suicide once and that you would always be open if I ever needed anybody to talk to. You were laughing, but I could tell you really meant that and had a good heart. Maybe you saw a bit of sadness in me. We joked about writing an essay due tomorrow and you left with a friend.

I'll always remember your intellectual comments in our FWS and how slightly shy and friendly you were in class. You gained a lot of confidence since then. I hope you didn't lose that good in you to the fraternity culture or life at Cornell."

I'm a senior this year and I have very few friends- many of them have either graduated or drifted from me and are hanging out without me. To make things worse, I'm living with people who I feel barely like me. I don't know how to make myself likeable again among my old friends, or even how to make new friends entirely, since I'll be graduating anyway. I feel tremendous pain and loneliness inside and I have no one to talk to about it, not even my own parents. I sometimes honestly have to take a break from my work, and either write in my journal or cry, and this prevents me from being productive. Wtf is wrong with me? My first two years of college were nothing like this, it's only the past year or so where everything went downhill. I need some serious life advice. I kind of just wish this damn school would let me graduate now so I can leave."

Last fall I tried to kill myself. I ended up being convinced by my friend to call 911 after I took all of my medication. I wish that I didn’t. I am stuck with a hospital bill that I can’t pay, even though I told the doctors that I could not afford to stay in the hospital. $10,000 Later I am released and required to take a mandatory leave from school for two semesters whilst paying back a $2000 refund that was mistakenly given to me. Well 6 months into my leave I start getting calls from Sallie Mae about my loans and how I have to pay them. $300 a month…which I don’t have. I work from 5pm to 3am overnight to make less than $900 a month to watch it all go away. I’ve lost over 40 pounds because I can’t afford to buy any food to eat often. 

I wish I had died that night so I wouldn’t have to deal with this. 
I know some people are gonna say, """"but if you didn’t try and kill yourself in the first place you wouldn’t be having to deal with any of this”

This is what my school told me and my counselor and Sallie Mae. I’m sorry I can’t control my depression. This is what made me want to die. People telling me not to feel the way I do, but I can’t help it. 

I just want someone who understand how I feel to help me instead of telling me not to feel a certain way….I know people are gonna but me down and make me feel like shit and call me weak because of this. 
I've been told this all my life so go ahead, you are just reiterating something I already know."

I like making people smile with my music and helping people out randomly without really knowing them. I want to turn 22, leave here, and then make music for everybody to enjoy.

It would be like Maggie Gyllenhaal from Stranger than Fiction (obscure references??), who made people happy with her cookies instead of being a lawyer. It's scary to live as a musician, but I think it'll be more fun than working at some tech firm in Silicon Valley like every other person who majors in CS or ECE here. Don't get me wrong, being a musician isn't really sustainable, and I like what I study here, but at least I can make other people happy by going into music.

The only problem is that I'd have wasted a degree and four years of my life. :(

There are so many dumb people are Cornell. I thought -- well, Cornell is not the very very best when it comes to the world's leading universities. It's certainly up there, but there are better ones. Then I went to Harvard -- same deal. Tons of dumb people. I met a few people from Yale and Princeton too. It's shocking how many of them talk like the cast of Jersey shore. A shocking number of them if I just randomly met and started talking to I'd assume they barely finished high school.These institutions have sub 10% acceptance rates. Harvard's is 5-6% I think. Who the heck are they turning down?"

I was really really depressed this past semester, and thus took an Incomplete for a course I was taking in the Spring, on the condition that I complete the coursework (final exam) by the end of August. I had to spend all summer working, but I studied when I could (2-3 times per week), and this last month I've studied every day. I understand the material that is presented in the textbook and the questions that were presented in the discussion sections with no problem. But looking over the past prelims, I think I'm screwed. Now I'm supposed to take the final exam tomorrow. I think I'm going to fail, and I'm scared I'm going to be kicked out of Cornell. I know it's a bit early in the semester for people to sympathize with this, but here's hoping I get hit by a car. (Or a miracle happens.)"

My neighbor on my hall keeps playing rap music super fucking loud at night, and even though I haven't yet seen him, I really hope he's not black. Because I am, and he should know how badly that is going to make us both look. Why? In part because the world is a terrible place full of oversimplification of human beings.

Thank you for sitting near me and eating quietly. Few people can. But, at the same time, do you really appreciate a quiet meal alone? Because when I mentioned that you seemed to, you did not welcome me as a fellow soul with this preference. Which is fine. I'm sorry if I ruined your dinner with my candor. I still am grateful for your (perceived) solidarity. 

P.S. I was not in any way trying to flirt with you. I think people often mistake my efforts to love and be kind to all people, especially the ones who bring me quiet joy with their humanness, as demonstrated romantic interest."

I can not help the price change, delivery charge, tax, or whatever coupons we happen to accept or not accept anymore (I had a person threaten me because they could only use a coupon up to a certain amount. People have been abusing these things forever and no one was abiding by the coupon rules so instead of taking it away we made sure each customer could break their coupons to the maximum amount as well as get a refund but that's not enough.

        Imagine a typical night out at New York. You are wearing a button down shirt, slacks, nice shoes, your buddies by your side as you walk into this rooftop bar. Heck man, you’re pretty happy you even got in, considering that it is two guy friends you are with at the moment -testament to our looks, for sure. Tonight is the night, whatever that even means.
        First thing you do when you get there? Grab a beer, something ‘fancy’, you know, like a 12 dollar IPA. You’re working at BAML, 9:30 to midnight, so of course you can afford that stuff. Plus, you got to get something that nobody really knows about – demonstrate how “complicated”, “hipster” you are. Girls love that, or so you think.
        It is not like you really asked yourself if that is what they actually think. Majority of the nights, returning home from work where you make those PPT presentations, you swipe on your phone – left, right, right, ‘eh, she will work’ - right. It is like you’re in a relationship with the app and the pictures within it, not the people behind it. Radical? Well, that depends on how we define a relationship here. Do you keep in touch every day? Check. Do you spend at least 30 minutes together? Yepp. Do you miss not using ‘it’? Aha. 
        The point is you get laid. Slam, bam, thank you ma’am. No matter how many times that happens though, you always go back to swiping. So easy and convenient. Slept with three girls this week for less than 80 bucks – that’s a steal, am I right? You can make that back in like 3 hours after taxes, definitely worth it.
        It’s nothing but a convenience. The illusion of choice. Diversification, for the finance oriented. Why would you ever need something more serious? Agree with you there, 100%. Like any good banker though, we should answer a fundamental question – what are we diversifying here? What risk are we talking about? Whereas inherent volatility is (supposedly) well understood for stocks and commodities, what ‘volatility’ do we have in mind when swiping? Let’s take a stab at it, shall we? 
        The risk is getting hurt. Falling for someone so hard that you can’t stop thinking about them and go back to reading WSJ business section. Waking up in the morning and smiling because you think of her hair, hair lips, her complexion. You can’t be sure that they are into you as you are into them. After all, it’s not like there is anything official. 
        Look, the way I see it, there are two ways out of this situation. First, we devote ourselves to the other person, make our feelings known. Take them out on a date, (preferably before midnight) so you can get to know them (before they black out).  Doing this will open you up to volatility of the relationship and emotional rollercoasters, but the upswing can be huge. They can be that person that bring meaning to you, which make it all worth it.
        Option number two: pretend we don’t feel, pretend we don’t even have the need to feel. We watch Netflix & chill. We swipe right, send two emojis, get the number, hookup, repeat. Life is good, as long as we are in the game. But will you, the player, always be engaged in the game? Or will there be a time when you crash on a couch late at night, and think to yourself that something is missing?
        The beauty of option one is that we do end up getting hurt from time to time, but that pain is what makes us stronger. It’s how we learn more about ourselves, and what qualities are crucial in other people. We are honest with ourselves. We admit that we are afraid, yet work through it. Option two will spare us that, but at the cost of maturity. We will remain cowardly, we will remain scared of getting hurt. Like a child in a crib who never ventures outside of the little enclosure because the outside is full of sharp objects, heights, and dirt. 
        We were children once, but now we are adults. We took a step (well, more like a crawl) outside because curiosity overtook us. Take that step again. Get hurt. Learn. Devote and open yourself to people, and have people open themselves to you."

Hey you, guess what? I still like you! A lot! I know we've discussed not dating each other, or rather you expressed not wishing to date me and instead just staying as friends, and I finally became fine with it at the beginning of the summer. But we hung out a lot over the summer, and now you have ruined me perfectly. All I can think about is you. I really want to know whether you still feel that we won't be good as a couple. Why not?

I freaked out this morning, because I couldn't find one of my balls. I was feeling around for quite a while, but after a diligent investigation I was able to account for both of them. Phew. What a scare. I woke up with pain in the area, so I thought maybe one had deflated or something had happened to it. But no, it was just a good old case of blue balls, due to a date last night that involved a lot of making out without sealing the deal. I will know better than to not masturbate after something like that again."

YOU'RE FINE. your life could be worse, so STOP feeling sorry for yourself. you're pathetic. stop whining. no one wants to be friends with a whiney pessimist....

I've battled depression several times now and I know what I have to do to feel better. But after so many times, I'm exhausted. I'm finding it difficult to conjure up the willpower and strength to fight it once again. I feel I am in a never ending war with myself. All I want is lasting peace. Hopefully, I can find it one day."

1 year, 2 months, 3 days. I've never been so alone since graduation. I know, I deserve it. And that's that. I'm finally independent like I've always wanted and yet I've imagined our conversation and you coming back so many times. Over and over and over. I have so much to say to you and yet, nothing really at all. 

This past year I've become you. I laugh and joke and smile at work. I make up stories. Somehow, maybe because I stopped caring, I've become popular, people like me and respect me. I'm on track for an excellent rating. But when I leave the office, I go home and just sit there. Staring at a wall. It's just empty. I'm hollow. Know one knows me, I don't even know me.

Knowing how horny I get, if most men get the same amount of horny on a regular basis, it's really amazing there isn't more rape. I'm not defending men in any way here, but when you think about it, rape is almost natural and it's a testament to human will to form a civilized society that we've minimized it as much as we have. It can always be less of course, but knowing how many stupid idiots walk around, the fact they can restrain themselves to a considerable degree is kind of amazing. Women really have no idea the kind of horniness that we experience every waking hour, and I bet most men hate it as much as I do. I wish it didn't happen, it would save me a lot of frustration. Thank goodness for masturbation, we would have NEVER gotten out of the caves if it didn't exist. Life finds a way..."

I don't know what to confess.  I guess, I'm just not terribly happy right now.  I was happy until he started questioning me, and now I'm thinking about things I've never thought about before just because he's put those thoughts there.  If he hadn't, I'd be fine and dandy. 
I feel like I just have to do what I want to do.  He's always been about sacrificing everything for family, and I think he's kind of miserable right now.  Yes, you have to care for family.  I love mine to death.  I love you guys so much, and I totally agree about prioritizing family.  But it is also really important to take care of yourself.  If you don't take care of yourself, you can't properly take care of your family.
I think you need to take care of yourself more.  You need to assess your situation and focus on yourself.  What will make you happy?  It can't be from me, or from substances.  It has to be from yourself."

I think more unattractive people should be in media, news, movies, etc. Especially unattractive women - there are already plenty of unattractive men. They're probably thinking attractive women will get more viewers, but honestly as a lonely guy who has been rejected by almost every female I've shown interest in, and have had every attractive woman look at me as an undesirable life form, I associate attractive women with sorrow and loneliness, like seeing something you want that you know you can never have. I know that sounds horrible and I certainly do not judge anyone based on looks, but on a very primal level, if they think I am more likely to watch b/c someone is attractive - no, quite the opposite. I don't need to be reminded constantly of the hordes of attractive human beings that are out there that I have no access to. I'd rather focus on what they're saying."

I miss you Cornell! I learned (and suffered) so much both in and out of your classrooms, but I have no regrets. The most crucial thing I learned at this place was the power of endurance and maintaining a sense of humor: All you have to do is survive and laugh at all this bullshit till things eventually get better.

I meet an incredible woman yesterday. Strong, beautiful, resilient, fun and a smile that makes me melt. We stayed up all night singing together. Video chatting all of the songs that I love, songs I never thought other people would know. Much less like.

I stopped enjoying porn--and, by association, masturbation--about a year ago. Porn is just stylized, exaggerated, unrealistic sex, preceded by abysmal acting. It's male-centric, degrading, sexist, and just the worst in every way. When I masturbate now, I feel like there is a constantly expanding cavity of air beneath my temple, a pressure that consumes my intellect and morality. I recently read an article that found a connection between decreased gray matter in the brain and the viewing of porn, so that doesn't help my situation. 

I only jack off now in order to maintain the allusion of normalcy. To relieve the sexual tension that is nearly inevitable for any adult. I used to have a bad habit of fetishizing and romanticizing certain types of women, and now I feel a dark guilt cropping up from my gut whenever I watch porn. The sadistic irony is that I'm masturbating in order to escape the habit, to keep myself focused and kind whenever I interact with people. And it works. I just wish there was some other way, or that I could be truly asexual. 

I'm happy with my life and generally amiable, or at least that's how I believe people perceive me. I'm even nice, normal, and decent with the opposite sex, until I get any kind of attraction to them, that is. Then things go haywire, and my sexual urges lead to ill-advised decisions (not the twisted cruel, rapey kinds but the sad, awkward, socially inept kinds that ruin good friendships) and things don't work out and then I masturbate. Sigh...

What I want is a relationship, not sex. In fact, at this point in my life and mental development, my thoughts on women have led me to believe that sex would be the last thing on my mind, should things work out for me. Of course, this is assuming I continue masturbating every once and a while to lessen my libido. There is a bright side though: Even though I'm still human and therefore weak-minded when it comes to masturbation, I'm feeling like I finally understand the whole girl thing. I haven't had any success yet, but I also haven't tried. And I don't plan to anytime soon. Which means I'm stuck masturbating for a while. But at least I am more confident these days that I could end this vicious cycle, that I could secure a relationship. And then I'll stop, because all of my sexual desire will be replaced, I presume, with love and the desire to not fuck up my first and only true success story. I'll be too focused on being the best boyfriend I can be to continue with this madness. So I'm optimistic. I'm happy. And to all women, until the day comes that I can put this behavior away for good, I am sorry."

Since I haven't had the courage to say it yet, I will say it here, on a forum, where dozens of people will question if it's about them, when it's actually about YOU. (I doubt your going to think this is about you any way). I love you baby, and I miss you like crazy!!"

We're in different fields so we probably won't be going to the same grad school. And even if we make it through that, the odds that we'll get jobs at universities close to each other (because let's not pretend we'll get a spousal hire fresh out of grad school) are super low. I love you, but I don't want to be the thing that holds you back, and you've said you don't want to hold me back. I love you, but what if the best thing for both of us is to let it go? I just wish the two body problem was easier to solve..."

I don't hear back from employers, I don't hear back from dates, I don't hear back from people I'm trying to be friends with, I don't hear back from professional contacts I made at networking events... I barely hear back from my friends and family.

I get it. You're not interested. But at least show me some vestigial respect, some minimal amount of decency in letting me know. If there's silence, I really don't know what's going on and I have to email you twice before I realize you're not interested. And then I feel like a terrible person. And it hurts, it really does. Silence is 10 times worse than a rejection because it says not only do I want nothing to do with this person, I also have zero respect for him. I always get back to people. I just cannot fathom someone writing me a paragraph that they put effort into, politely asking me something and then my just thinking - oh fuck them. And yet, that's 90% of the interaction I have with people. I know it's my fault somehow, but it still hurts. It's often people I've done favors for or worked for or been extremely nice to too."

Fuck me, I really can't pull my thoughts together.  What you did was exactly what I had hoped would happen all four years of high school (and my two years at Cornell).  Someone actually asking me to hang out.  Someone banging on my fucking door, asking me to hang out.  What I could not tell you to your face is that I have spent the entire summer thus far doing nothing but watching Minecraft Let's Plays, playing (and beating Skyrim), and watching porn.  I was working for my dad, but I fucked up a job and now no one in my family is talking to me.  Seriously, my mom won't even let me have any of the dinner she makes.  I thought my depression was bad at school.  Before the cock up earlier this week, I had no face-to-face human contact with no one outside my family.  Now I don't even have their shitty company.  I alienated all the people I could even casually talk to here in town long ago.  
I don't remember how this started.  I don't remember why I started feeling this way.  Now it keeps itself going: ""high achieving"" student in high school doing shitty at Cornell.  ""Physics major"" who has lost all interest in physics (and everything else, but more on that later).  Quit working for my dad and now listless when I should be doing research.  Alone and friendless when I should be firming up who I want to be and going on adventures with people.  Finding a group I would feel right singing ""The Parting Glass"" to when my days at Cornell come to a close and we part ways.
Yeah, fuck you, people who say I should go out and make friends.  Besides the fact that I have not had a serious deep conversation since my freshman year here, I've lost my interest in everything.  There was a time when I would spend weeks reading fantasy books.  Rings, Names, Wind...I would read great stories and think deep things.  Now, well, like I said.  Nothing.  Even what I watch is more just something to look at.  I'm obviously not engaging.  They just distract me, make me feel less alone.  I can't imagine how talking to someone in person would play out.  I have nothing to talk about.  Judging by how I was talking to my sister before the falling out, I have a hard time thinking about or reacting to things.  I've got nothing.  Even this, something I'm writing and can dwell on for a while I am having trouble with.  I don't want to talk about depression.  I want to fucking move on from this and feel better.  Seriously.  But that  
I've burned my letter marking me as one of the top seven students of my graduating class.  I've ripped up my edition of The Lord of the Rings.  I've smashed my Kindle and shredded my Star Wars books.  Because what have these things got me?  Fuck all.  I went on a long bike ride today without my helmet with the hope that I could find a nice large truck to will myself to dart out in front off and get hit.  Fuck this.
  I couldn't find my Cornell acceptance letter,  that I would burn with lots and lots of gasoline.  Because Cornell has left me isolated and alone.  Fuck.  Me.  I suck."

Pretty sure 2 sorority sisters are messing with me right now. I was sent identical tinder messages in the span of 5 minutes, one of which was very forward. I called one out on it and she said she didn't know the other girl (who is in pictures on her wall). And I don't know if it's random, girls I know in their house, or my ex (friends with both) who is behind it, if it's not a coincidence anyway. Their distances were also identical and far outside my range...

They also both have this page liked, and have a fair shot at seeing it."

On July 13th. I passed a guy on the trail behind Mann Library at around 4:45pm, I should have stopped to talk to you. I saw you standing on the side of the path and you looked like you were going through something rough. It looked like you were praying, or maybe just taking some time to think, but I wanted to stop and ask if you were alright. I didn't, and I regret it. I know what it's like to just want to get away from the world, and I would have wanted someone to stop for me. I was the guy with the orange backpack, and I was hating myself for the rest of my walk home for not saying anything. If I see you there again, I won't make the same mistake twice."

1997,2015-08-18 11:11:41,"6053
I'm honestly so sick of how the ""body-positive"" movement has morphed into a fat acceptance movement. You should absolutely never shame someone for their appearance or make them feel inferior for not meeting some arbitrary cultural beauty standard. The media perpetuates an impossible ideal that is damaging to the self-esteem of our young women (and older women!) and has a hundred other negative consequences and it's terrible. I get that. But so many people I see as part of this movement are literally obese. There is a line between accepting and celebrating a wide range of natural body types and condoning or supporting an unhealthy condition (yes, obesity is a disease and it's epidemic in the US).

But then I hear people who share my opinion going off in the other direction, saying it's okay to tell smokers not to smoke, why can't we tell obese people the same? Fuck that. Full disclosure, I'm a smoker. I KNOW it's horrible, I've seen all the public service announcements that you have. I've tried to quit multiple times and I'm still fucking working on it. If a close friend wants to express concern to me that's fine, but people seem to feel free to call me out all the goddamn time. No. You do not get to do that, let's all learn some basic politeness and leave people alone. 

tl;dr Don't condone unhealthy lifestyles (lung cancer isn't beautiful, neither is obesity), but don't be a gaping asshole to people."

The university declined my loan over the summer for 2000 dollars because I'm not taking summer classes and my bursar bill isn't paid because it all went to rent and living expenses last year.  My security deposit for 1300, not including first month's rent, is due by the end of the month and I don't have any way of making money besides whoring myself out. 

I hope that if you read this and you are one of those incredibly lucky people who don't need to worry about money, you don't take it for granted. I see people on campus wearing Canada goose jackets and hunter boots and I need to prostitute myself to make ends meet...and even then, it isn't enough. I really hope you are grateful for what you have, because having enough money to live comfortably isn't a sin, but not appreciating it is.

I wish I could have that luxury."

I graduated from Cornell, got a job at one of those hot tech firms and got the H-1B. YAY nice, right?
Not so fast... You Americans have no idea how painful it is to get a work visa. USCIS is screwing up with me. My H-1B is good only after October. I applied for a temp work visa (OPT), and USCIS rejected it. Like, they rejected because a document was supposedly 31 days old (maximum acceptable is 30 days). Detail: my application arrived on the 29th day and they actually opened it on the 31st day. 

Now I moved to an expensive city, was expecting to start working next week, but no, I can't. I tried to talk to some people about this, but my closest friends think I need their money. Well, not really for now because I still got some savings... I just wanted someone to talk vent out. Oh Lord... :("

I’ve arrived in Ithaca to start the move-out process following my withdrawal from Cornell and eventual transfer to another college. Needless to say, however, that it has definitely changed me in so many ways. These are some of the top things that I learned:

1. My closest friends are (and will always be) the ones I have from home. Nothing separates us.

2. I might not be the most social person, but I’ve learned to embrace my inner introvert.

3. If you’re smart and go to a school of extremely intelligent people, don’t ever feel average.

4. My dating game is terrible, and I missed so many opportunities. No risk, no reward.

5. Don’t forget that there’s a world outside of college.

6. Don’t forget to be social, at least sometimes. And no, going to class doesn’t count.

7. I thought I was liberal, but being at CU made me see the world differently and changed that. No matter what side you’re on with any big issues, respect the opinions of others. 

8. Not only in the context of #7 but in any context, explore and challenge the ways you think in college.

9. Be careful of who you trust. Friends that only get in touch with you when they need something aren’t friends at all.

10. Health and happiness trump absolutely everything else.

Peace out, Cornell! It’s not you. It’s me. It’s time to move on."

-a depressed person who's been making lots of progress

P.S. if you're just running and trying to get better, if you're getting strongly out of breath before you start sweating you're going way too fast: getting speed takes time if you're not there yet and the  weeks of building up to what you consider ""adequate running"" is totally worth it once you start getting closer and closer."

I know for a lot of things, being a Senior makes it impossible to get involved, but I know I can find the right thing with some help."

You want to hear a real confession? Here's something I haven't told a soul, but as of late I feel the need to tell someone or I'll end up blurting it out to someone who could damage me with it. Let's see. Some time ago, I had a girlfriend, a nice girl who never meant any harm, with a kind heart. She was rather taken with me, even though I wasn't all that interested in relationships at the time, but she was nice and wanted me to be her boyfriend. The time we spent together was wonderful, going to date nights and formals (yes, frat boys do have hearts, contrary to popular belief) and sharing our inside jokes. She laughed at my attempts at humor, which was good enough for me. She was pretty, funny, the complete package, completely undeserving of a wretched, selfish bastard like myself (I like to think I've improved, but who am I to judge). The year was drawing to a close, and we were having as good a time as ever, or so she perceived. I was on the brink. Total self destruction, the call of the void, whatever you call it. I was preparing to kill myself. No, I wasn't having trouble with school or friends, I was just depressed. Have been my entire life. Family history, lonely childhood, all that jazz. I saw this girl that was so full of life, so undeserving of a boyfriend who would abandon her like this. I knew I had to break it off before the summer began, to protect her, to buffer her from myself, and I left. I couldn't bring myself to tell her, lest she try and stop me. At the time, I needed the escape and couldn't let anyone stand in my way. So, I got drunk, smashed, wasted, shitfaced drunk and broke up with her, trying to convince her that I was a jerk who didn't deserve her. I was certainly convincing enough. We broke up, and I almost succeeded in my attempt a few weeks later, but it just ended in a prolonged stay in a psych ward. I'm not any better now than I was in that regard, just accepting of who I am and my urges. I just wish I could tell her, so that she could call off her sorority sisters who scorn me at every chance they get as the guy who hurt their sister for seemingly no reason. I'm sorry. I'm sorry for what I did. I thought it was the best at the time. I wish I could tell you. I'm glad you've found you're new beau. You seem quite happy with him. And that's really all that truly matters. Happiness. Everyone deserves it."

Throughout my life, I have come to realize I was never made to be loved. I've been betrayed by those I hold close, even my family. I am in love with my boyfriend but he doesn't love me, even though this relationship was his idea. And my friends just use me. I am entertainement for them when they need me, but they are never there for me, never understand me. That is why I am fully okay with dying doing what I love. Because my death won't matter to anyone, but the difference I made before I died will mean alot."

I'm afraid that I focused so hard on academics in high school that I didn't develop socially. I come out of conversations with acquaintances feeling like a failure because I can't say the right things at the right time, and I just don't know how to stand or what I'm supposed to do. I've never really been in a relationship, and I haven't kissed anyone in 3 years. At Cornell, I want to succeed in more areas of my life than just academics, but I don't think I have the social skills to do so."

Here's a story a few peeps could probably relate to. I used to date this fun, beautiful, and ridiculously intelligent girl in high school. Our relationship lasted for a solid amount of time and it was a damn good one. When we went to college we ended up breaking up and I felt miserable for a long time. Being the girl she is she found a long term boyfriend almost immediately who seem(s)(ed), in all honesty, like a much better guy than me. Of course I felt jealous, I felt cheated, I felt bitter and I felt lonely. She would call and with the kindest of intentions she would console me and try to make me feel better all while making it clear that we had gone our separate ways. And I loved talking to her, but after every FaceTime, every message, I would feel like complete and absolute shit. Because I still wanted her back. I became so focused on the loss of her that my reality became muddled by wistful fantasies and unfounded hopes. And I'm still not over it. Do I know I'm only making myself more unhappy by focusing on past regrets? Of course. Do I know that what I feel is morally objectionable? Absolutely. I tell myself that I should just be happy for her happiness, but I'm no saint. I, whether I want to or not, live and feel for myself over everything. So what do I do? Do beat my emotions until they feel what I want them to feel? Take it in stride, smoke a cigar, and admire the beauty of life? I often wish that I would have, by chance, slipped into a friend group that had picked me up and given me a community to be at home in as she had. In my suffering I had chosen to isolate myself and in my bitterness I had decided to blame my surroundings. Do I regret that too? Yah, I do. But my life is my own and things are as they are. Do I have a resolution? No, not really. But I'll be damned if I don't make myself happy this next year. Cornell, I'm coming for you."

To my boyfriend's roommate, yes, we had sex while you were asleep. Yes, when you walked in and we both claimed to be too cold to poke more than our heads from the covers, you really did walk in on us having sex. No, of course those were my underpants, not his, lying on your floor. When you came in and we were getting handsy on top of his philosophy books, that really was because talking about Socrates got us both hot for each other #nerds. When I left when he was in the shower and came back with wet hair, I had sex with him in your shower. I'm so sorry that he didn't manage to get a single next year. We'll (try to) keep the poetry sex down to a minimum."

I am so lonely. I generally do okay on my own, find fulfillment in my work and hobbies, etc. But it all still seems like a kind of distraction when I realize that there's still something missing, something big.

 I wanted to explore the trails and try out new things this summer...which I am doing...but there's only so much of that I want to do either with my friends or by myself. I've been living alone and single for six months now and I'm just starting to lose hope that I will ever find anyone compatible. I've lost a bunch of weight and toned up, gotten a bit more confident talking to men each time I've gone on a date, etc. but I rarely connect and, on the rare occasion that I do, that connection hasn't been reciprocated. What the fuck am I doing wrong?! Well, I think I intimidate the hell out of some men just by casually mentioning my work and accomplishments early on so I've toned that down though I think I needn't. Other than that, I'm completely lost. There's nothing else on which I can introspect. Maybe I'm just being impatient but my heart feels heavier and heavier each time I see a couple embrace at Stewart Park at sunset or share an intimate moment in front of me. The multiple rejections are just making things worse after my break-up but I don't want to give up."

I'm a homosexual man and don't really like the whole idea of ""gay culture"" and ""gay lifestyle"" that the American mainstream media and the gay community itself try to portray themselves with. To me, it's very promiscuous and superficial. Just because I like other men, doesn't mean I like dancing and grinding with five other guys. I want something more than just a hook-up you know? Being out in the gay community, you're kinda stuck in this ""hook-up"" culture that dominates the ""gay identity"".Whatever happens to true love? And cuddling, and cooking together?

Ok. So here is this girl with very beautiful eyes. She I guess is a CS major because I used to see her in Gates hall. Plus she was kind of auditing Computer Vision class this sem. She sometimes wears black nerdy types glasses. Sometimes used to wear nose ring too. Has a green color backpack I guess and used to have brown boots during winters. Has light brown long hair. I always used to think at least I should approach and talk to her. But I thought it might appear very creepy. Our eyes used to meet sometimes during the Computer Vision class which I was auditing too. I don't know what's her name or what's her no. or anything. But I feel if I never tried now, I might regret my whole life. I am regretting even now every time I used to see her in Computer Vision class this semester at Gates Hall , every time my heart would start pounding very heart giving an indication I should at least go and talk to her. But then my shyness would spoil everything for both of us. Me and my heart :-(. And whole day my heart would get angry and stop talking to me. :-(. 

If anyone is able to figure out the girl or know her name or any profile or link that would really help. Even know my heart sometimes thinks of her, stops talking to me often. And I end up placating him. So I want to get over this now. Tired of seeing his rudeness towards me every now and then."

""I was recently accepted into Cornell--CALS. It is my dream school and I can't begin to tell you how immensely proud and suprised I was accepted!!...and not rejected or not put on the wait list. I'm so excited and very nervous about the workload! I know, I got this (I hope!) I'm also doing PSP. But, I'm scared. I was always a social caterpillar in high school and easily made friends. I'm scared that people won't like my craziness or weirdness. I'm scared people won't find me attractive. I'm scared that I won't find my """"squad.""""

 While this seems like a petty thing to be concerned about, let me defend myself by saying this: if I am not comfortable in my environment I do not do well. And I can't control how people see me or know what they think of me. I can't believe I'm doubting myself right now. I know I'm stronger that this but sigh. I made some friends with the help of Facebook Groups but idk I get offended quickly if someone doesn't like my comment or comments back. I take it personal and I want to get over it, but I feel like I'm over thinking it. As mature as I appear, I have insecurities that I can't conquer yet. It's eating me alive. 

Any advice on how to get over my fear of being in a new environment, making friends, and staying confident would be greatly appreciated. """

""Here's what I did when I was 18. I bought an airline ticket to New York City. I went to the airport. They told me my suitcase was over the weight limit and I had to pay an extra $20 to get it on board. I did not have $20. So my solution was this - I removed the single heaviest object from my ginormous suitcase - which was a DESKTOP - that's right - a DESKTOP computer tower. I removed a bunch of heavy clothes too. I asked for a box. I put the computer and the clothes in said box and I asked them if they could hold on to it for me; that I would call my friend and have him drive by and pick up the box. I would do this once I arrived in New York, because I did not have a cell phone at the time, nor change to use a payphone.

They were 1) shocked that I didn't have $20 or a credit/debit card that could be charged $20 2) that I could not call anyone to ask for money or help in general 3) that I pulled a DESKTOP computer out of my suitcase and 4) that I asked them to do this, which I could tell was the first time anyone had made such a request. But they said okay. I arrived in New York. I called my friend. He said he would drive by. He did the next day and he told me he couldn't get it. So I lost my $1000 computer, with a 500 GB HDD full of my life and a bunch of other things too in the single weirdest and dumbest possible way. This happened in 2006.

I've since graduated from Cornell, accomplished a fair amount and, and I am currently rather successful by most standards. And I am a few orders of magnitude smarter than I was then, by any measure. What is my point - you are going to do a lot of stupid things when you are 18. Don't think too much of them, don't read into them, don't try to figure out what went wrong and how you should fix it. You will do dumb things as a teenager and into your early 20s. A lot of them will involve people of the opposite sex. But it gets better. It gets much better. If you're intelligent, work hard, and have good intentions, amazing things will happen!"""

I love my boy friend to pieces, it's the little things, his little quirks. But sometimes, the things he does that seem like no big deal to him, make me angry. Like not texting me for a day, starting a conversation and not finishing it, being emotional available one moment, and emotionless the next. But the worst thing is him not telling me how he feels about me, and expecting me to know. I'm horrible at guessing and assuming, so unless it's said, I will never know.

I fell in love with your intelligence, and ambition to chase after the things you were passionate about, but the barriers between us seem too difficult to overcome. It is best for me to move on, but after our brief, unexpected encounter, all the feelings I tried hiding resurfaced.

Usually it takes me up until the last month or two of school to meet somebody like that, and then the time difference over the summer screws up any chance at something longer term."

This way I can put all my time and effort into learning as much about my research area as possible, as well as related areas of my major, and also get closer to securing a place in one of my top grad schools.

I have an internship lined up, but it doesn't start until late June. Until then, I'm home, with no one to talk to. All of my Cornell friends are on the other side of the country and actually have decent relationships with their families. I can't wait to be back in Ithaca, I'll be much less unhappy there, 2,000 miles away from all the bullshit people call family."

""A pretty significant part of me wants to quit my major and start college over to become a psychologist. I've actually known I wanted to be a counselor since high school, but I was so depressed myself that I didn't think I'd be good for the job. But now I realize that having depression and anxiety, struggling with a dermatillomania, probably having a personality disorder (it's not officially diagnosed yet), surviving child abuse, and being pansexual and genderqueer... would make me a better counselor, not a worse one, because I actually GET it. I don't just know about these issues, I really UNDERSTAND them, because I've been there too, I've lived it, I know what it's like. There's only so much you can empathize with a person without having lived their life.

But I'm a rising senior and my brother starts college right after I graduate, and my parents definitely can't afford to pay for two college students at once. I don't know if I'll ever get to follow this path."

I go to office hours, review sessions, study groups, learning centers and spend countless hours in the library. Nothing's working. It's the end of my sophomore year and I just feel totally hopeless about applying for anything next year but I don't want to take a gap year because I won't be able to do anything productive due to my low grades.

I was born in China, but came to the US at a very young age. It's holidays like Memorial Day that make me question whether or not I want to change my citizenship (I am still technically Chinese). I would like to think of myself as an American, but how can I celebrate American troops who once raped the women of my birth country and those of other East Asian countries, in the name of freedom? Places keep playing the ""I'm proud to be an A-meri-can"" song today, and I can't say I would be so proud of America's past."

White American girls are so hard to flirt with. At least that's been my experience. Maybe it's just Cornell and NYC which is where I've had experience. But international students or any non-white American girls are so much more open and social and you can just have a normal conversation with them. White American girls tend to be so particularly uptight and cautious. I actually feel like some stalker or a sex offender talking to them, just because they project that image on me. As soon as they detect I may be interested in them, the 9-foot brick wall goes up. I don't blame you, you're probably the most hit on demographic, but honestly, that definitely exists. I apologize if it's racist and/or in some other way offensive. I'm an American white guy for the record, so if I am being offensive, I extend some of that to myself. It's just an observation."

I really miss Cornell. I hated it when I first came. But somehow I came to love the late night Nastie's runs, bonding in the floor lounge, pulling all-nighters to finish assignments, bitching about said assignments, walking past the gorges, smiling when the clocktower played Harry Potter, and hanging out with my friends. I'm just really sad that freshman year ended so quickly. It's never going to be the same. We are going to grow apart and I'm scared of that. I'm scared that it's going to be like starting all over again (except I'm already used to the academic side). Can I just rewind back to beginning so I can appreciate my school better?"

I am doing nothing with my life, but academics. I started to give up this semester land not study. I did horribly on my finals; my cs grade is especially horrendous. I am so lost. Part of me believes that I need help, but I feel that the stigma attached to that outweighs the benefits. Maybe I am alright after all, because there can't be anything wrong with me? I have gotten to this point without needing it, so why now? How could anybody help me anyways? I got this... I really don't know."

So being single is rough. I've learnt that. I'm trying, it's just tough. I have trouble finding the boundary between creepy/friendly and assertive/aggressive. Especially when it's girls in the same social circle.

So, despite loving a relationship and having an intimate physical and emotional connection, I think I might need to be single for a while, and be comfortable enough in my own skin and truly love myself before I can get serious with someone else. I don't like this idea, which I think means that it's the right one. I hope that makes sense."

Please just make a definitive statement one way or another so I can know whether or not to booty call you the next weekend."

""There are three of us here from my high school. One is graduating early with over a 4.0 GPA.
The other is winning a bunch of awards for leadership, service, excellence, etc etc.

And me? I'm struggling just to pass my classes each semester, I'm not involved with nearly as many clubs as I'd like to be, and I've done absolutely nothing of importance with my life. It takes everything I have just to avoid jumping off the fucking bridge. I'm such a failure.

[Nah, dude. You're doing the best you can, you can't compare yourself to others because they didn't have the same upbringing, experiences, etc. as you. Do the best you can, try and jump in a lab or get some work experience under your belt before you graduate. Believe me, Cornell is tough, and I'm graduating in the same boat as you.

I'm taking a class where the final exam and midterm are worth 55% and 45% of our final grade, respectively. At the beginning of the semester I was really excited about the class, as it's a subject I find fascinating. I read all of the textbooks before the start of class, and when it came time for the midterm, I was sure I would do well. But then the exams were passed out--it was about 20 pages long, mostly short answer questions, and we had an hour to finish. After a moment of panic, I started writing as fast as I could. By the end of the exam period, despite writing frantically, I had only finished about 70% of the exam, and my grade reflected it: I barely passed. After that experience, I became disenchanted, because what's the point? I loved the material, worked really hard, and displayed great understanding of the material in class/discussion sections, but it didn't make a difference. I stopped attending that class, because clearly my time would be better spent on other classes. I stopped studying for hours on end, because it never helped. So many students complained about the midterm that the professor reluctantly decided that the final *might* be adjusted (i.e. slightly easier, shorter)...I don't think that anyone who works hard, loves the subject, and displays a good understanding of the material should ever feel that their grade is based entirely on luck. That being said, I'm hoping for a miracle."

Coming from a third world country, I am aware of the difficulties and challenges that minority students face here at Cornell. And as a TA, I've tried to be exceptionally considerate of their circumstances and I have been incredibly patient with them. After all, I want to make them realize that I care about their situations too. But what I find appalling is when these students end up being demanding and don't even know how to say thank you. They don't recognize that you have made an effort to care. I am not saying that they don't have a right to be demanding because they're minority students. For me, I just want them to treat me with the least amount of appreciation just as how I have been thoughtful of their struggles."

""I hate to say it but the vast majority of us will not have the futures we envisioned.

I would venture to say the only worthwhile majors are Nursing, Accounting, and Engineering. Those fields don't require post-grad education to live a decent life, but that is changing for the worse.

All other majors require more DEBT and more YEARS OF YOUR FINITE LIFE to have a crack at a decent living. Sure, for example, doctors may get paid a lot(for the time being), but that takes twelve years and an inordinate debt load that firmly secures you in a stressful medical career for life. But then there is the issue of insurance companies, lack of reimbursement, and poor working environments (i.e. little interaction with patients, inability to have lucrative private practice). Of all you pre-meds, how many are actually in contact with recently graduated med students? Have you ever thought to ask them what the REALITY is? It's utter SHIT and doctors are generally dissatisfied and some are leaving the profession. Sure, a Porsche is nice, but when you can't treat patients because insurance formalities and malpractice stress, material things become vapid. It's like being a poor person with a lot of money. But in spite of this, if you still want to be a doctor, good on you! That's exactly who we need as medical professionals. Everyone else is deluding themselves with the """"Kool-Aid"""" ivy style.

And that brings to me my main point. When you came to Cornell, did you ever consider why you should come here? Did you really think that buying into the  """"Ivy League"""" would make you demonstrably more """"well rounded"""", """"wealthy"""" or """"educated""""? I would like to see the empirical evidence. Please, prove me wrong. The American Job Market is becoming automatized. Unless Mommy and Daddy have a lot of money and connections, your debt is most likely a life sentence. Actually, I take that back, employers can't be bothered when sifting through hundreds of inflated resumes, so an Ivy League pedigree may still be useful. But does Cornell really teach you demonstrable skills that you couldn't learn elsewhere on the cheap? More likely... Cornell teaches you to meet the pre-determined conclusions made by professors and coerces you to agree with those conclusions with grades. But that's every college... soo.....

College, especially nowadays, is a SCAM that you are willingly buying into. Education is not a bad thing! But Education does not always mean School. Bless President Skorton, he is a good man that gets too much unwarranted flack (god, do some of you even understand your own arguments or know a thing or two about respect?) . But damn, check out his salary and compare that with your projected starting salaries. Even with an Engineering PhD or an MD you'll be spending years just trying to break even.

The only solution to this dilemma? People should stop attending college and let many of them go out of business. Demand that college level education should be technical and linked to the job market and be very specific (1-2 year programs) Well roundedness is akin to communism... aka shit. There are flaws with this plan (and rant, heh), but it's a hell a lot better than (liberal) indentured servitude 100k in debt and working as a waitress (they make around 200 a week 2.13 an hour with tips, calculate rent, utilities, food, unplanned children, taxes, car, gas, savings, medical, crushed dreams, and beer)

Stop worrying about the short term: Instagram, Facebook, getting drunk, getting laid... and worry about the important things. Once your future is secured, then do all the stupid shit you want. Wise up to the reality please and change your major or school or acquaint yourself with the reality of the American job market."

I went on a date and then nearly had sex with a married man. If I hadn't been suspicious and looked up who he was, I inadvertently could have played a part in destroying a marriage and crushing the family stability of a toddler. I confronted the man about it, gave him some serious life advice and got him some help. 

I feel dead inside now. Absolutely dead. My faith in humanity has never, ever hit such a low nadir. That was my first date after leaving my husband. I thought about killing myself briefly but instead I've decided to stop dating for a while and instead volunteer for various ecological efforts. I'm just going to remove myself from humanity for a while and hope I decide to come back after healing a bit. Right now, I just hate everyone and everything about this fucked up institution, culture and civilization."

As graduation rolls in this Sunday, I'm searching through all my pictures over the last 4 years to make a short slideshow to commemorate all the great times with my friends. But I noticed that I don't have many pictures with friends, maybe a few dozen at most. I scroll through my roommate's pictures over the past four years: hundreds of pictures of him surrounded with friends, smiles to goofy faces, wearing anything from formal attire to crazy costumes. I sit back, speechless, hit with the sudden realization that I had hardly any of that. Perhaps I've been fooling myself that I have these close friends with crazy adventures all these years, perhaps I've walled up myself and prevented these connections from forming, perhaps the reason why I don't have these great times is because I simply didn't try. With that said, I sit here and wonder why? Why didn't I try harder to make connections with these people? Why did I put these walls up in my life? Why didn't I have a crazy spring break with my friends? Why do I care so much? In the end, I realized if I put up this slideshow, I'd just expose the lie, my delusion, of my bountiful and fulfilling social life, when in actuality I'm still struggling with finding my social circle, finding my true friends, and learning to be a true friend."

Need advice:

I'm a virgin and have never kissed a girl or been shown any kind of affection beyond a simple hug or maybe a girl sitting close to me. I have a girlfriend (relationship is only a couple weeks old) and I know for a fact that she has had much more sexual/intimacy experience than myself. She seems to think I'm well versed in all this, maybe because I've been playing everything real smooth and also because I lied and said that I wasn't a virgin (not to her, but to a few of our mutual friends and I never have explicitly stated or acted otherwise whenever sex is brought up in the conversation). 

I could hope that my smooth chillness or whatever will translate to a very natural, impressively executed loss of virginity--that I will open up the condom quickly and with confidence, slip it on like I've done it drunkenly 1000 times before, and do all the things I've hoped to do for a woman once I met someone worth being in a serious relationship with (only took 21 years of life haha.) 

But somehow I know that is extremely unlikely, especially since I'm notoriously awkward and uncoordinated when it comes to women and just physical activity in general. This could be a nightmare for both of us. We're inching closer and closer to making out, and then Sex. I just know it.

My question is: Should I tell her the truth before that moment so she can be prepared for a terrible, inexperienced kisser/ love maker or should I just wing it and hope for the best so as not to risk ruining the moment with my honesty and teenager-like anxiety/flaws?"

Moving back home is just weird. Cleaning out my room felt strange - like I was just picking up and throwing out everything my life had become and so much that made me happy. Looking in at my empty room just before I locked the door made everything that happened here seem transient and replaceable when I still feel so attached. Guess I'm going to have to get used to being separated from all that I come to know and then being thrown back into the past every few months. Not to mention suddenly being thrown forward and starting all over again. Places seem so intertwined with emotional experiences for me. I look at my room at home and remember things I'd rather forget as well as times I never wanted to pass. Seems like it'd be easier to simply not see. I need a lesson in numbness. I know it's only a few months but it feels like such a crazy shift."

As graduation comes closer and closer, I feel the need to let this out somewhere. I definitely won't do it publicly, since I don't need my friends to see me get all emotional and stuff.

I cannot goddamn wait to be rid of this place.

Now, I'm not trying to make a ""Cornell bad"" statement. I'm 100% cognizant of differences in experiences between individuals. Also, I would be remiss not to mention the positives of my experience. I've made many friends, probably close to quadrupled my intelligence, and I've managed to do things I could have scarcely imagined before attending this school.

That said, whatever I was coming into this school no longer exists. The idealistic person who wanted to change the world is gone, his dreams replaced by a dark cloud that doesn't seem to ever go away. I thought it was tied to the weather, but I find myself exhausted and unhappy even in the bright summer months. Even on the precipice of graduation, I can feel the presence of this cloud.

Semesters tend to start off well; I attend classes, do reasonably well on exams, etc. Then the stretch of the semester after October break, or after February break, begins and everything starts getting miserable. I sleep in and make small sacrifices to my grade that turn bigger and bigger. They say insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results; by that definition my time here has been pretty much off the charts crazy.

In my department, I am somewhat known as ""that kid who stops showing up to class."" My professors are aware of some personal issues I've had to deal with, so at the very least they don't hate me. That's all I can ask for.

My GPA has suffered. I am aware that this is my fault, largely blamable on constantly turning in assignments late and a lack of class participation. Even so, my four years at this school are represented by a number that only causes me embarrassment. This number may not follow me everywhere, but that doesn't change the fact that it exists, and will always exist somewhere in the files kept by the university. The academic record I was so proud of before college is now irreparably tarnished.

Despite this, I begrudgingly know I'm much better off now than I was four years ago. I have significant non-class-related achievements, and I have proved my knowledge of my coursework in other ways. Companies seem to have taken notice. I am jumping off a burning ship, but at least I learned how to swim.

So, Cornell, I simultaneously thank and curse you. I curse you for making me feel like shit, but I thank you for breaking me down and letting me build myself back up. I am not the same, but what I am now may serve me well in the future. And who knows. Maybe with time, that idealistic glint will return to my eyes."

Up to the end of our two year relationship, you said you loved me. Not even a month has passed and you're now in a new relationship, and you claim to love this person already. What the fuck? Do you know what love really is? Suddenly, I don't feel bad about you dumping me anymore."

The only texts I ever get, are the google verification codes for logging into my email.

On really bad days, i look at see a 1 on my messages. I open it excitedly to see it was just the google code I never bothered to open. Then I delete it. And the messages are empty again. 

Why bother writing these papers or cramming for these finals if before or after I didn't have friends who cared or will care about whatever it is i'll do in my future. 

No amount of material success that cornell can offer me can take eating alone every night and never going out or doing anything with anybody. This place is psychological torture. I would give anything to be stupid, ignorant, happy and content with minimum wage. 

I take a spot here from somebody more emotionally and mentally equipped to handle this place. 

Loneliness is going to kill me."

I don't not want to be friends. But knowing that our expectations and wants don't align is surprisingly painful. I want to keep being friends but god this hurts so much more than I thought was possible."

I'm usually very good about not sexualizing women as they're eating. But today I saw a girl take a mouthful of burrito and my life changed. I've never been attracted to women, but in this moment I had never been more infatuated with someone."

To the girl who I met at Collegetown Bagels on the morning of your biochem final and previously in the courtyard at Cascadilla, good luck with your biochem final and pre-vet goals!

As an engineering student, I've never taken an exam and thought to myself ""I got that question right because I studied that."" The exams for some classes seem to be really unrelated to what was supposed to be on them.

In short, test scores to me don't seem like a direct result of how much I studied. I'm not saying that I don't study, I am merely suggesting that there's only so many ways to study for tests in some engineering courses. Studying until the wee hours of the morning seems pointless, and there is a point in time when I do study that I think ""It's time to stop, studying any more than I already have isn't going to help."" It's the same principle as ""I'm drunk and having fun, and a couple more won't do much else besides make me pass out ."
2139,2015-05-18 11:28:27,"5911
I do talk to you - when I can't avoid it!  But otherwise, I clam up!!!  I can't help it. You just seem like an awesome person, and I don't know why, but I get nervous.  I thinks because I have a track record of doing embarrassing things, and I don't want to add another one to my list as a result of interacting with you. But maybe I should just go for it!  Who cares, right???  Embarrassing stories are the best, amiright?"

It's the end of my freshman year and I honestly feel like I wasted it all academically. I came in to Cornell thinking I could handle being pre-med in addition to my humanities major... got a D in chemistry and a C in biology last semester, and I anticipate similar grades this semester. My GPA is barely a 2.5. I forced myself to pursue subjects that I knew I didn't care for at all. Sure, next year I'll have a fresh start once I'm purely humanities and no longer have to struggle and cry my way through math problems or science textbooks, but that measly 2.5 will remain a dark cloud over my head as I work overtime in the next three years to recover from it. My friends are so successful--they ace their prelims, regularly score above the mean, and their biggest academic worry is getting Bs in classes that I would kill to have a B in. I don't think I'll get an A in anything this semester. I've never been more ashamed of myself. I've never been more afraid of my future."
2141,2015-05-18 11:12:34,"5909

I am an international student from a wealthy family. My parents recently told me that I probably will not have to worry about money for the rest of my life because they have made enough for me. I realize I am very privileged but that fact still does not take away from the fact that I'm scared. I'm scared because my parents want me to move back to my home country upon graduation, and I want to stay here. I'm scared because I don't know what my future holds. I'm scared because I don't know if I'll ever be able to live up to my dad's accomplishments. Even though I've lived a luxurious life, I get jealous of my friends who come from normal American homes. I'm a coward and no one knows it, because I hide behind a mask of confidence."

Yea we're not the best college, yet I'm still disappointed at what happened in the past few weeks - the recent racist yelling towards minority students, drunk people having lots of fun by dropping a beer bottle towards someone walking his dog under bridge, etc. I don't know. I even feel some kids are so proud of being jerks and snobs on this campus. So broken. So naive. I'm tired - not because of my school workload, but the fact that I have to see these annoying people now and then on this campus. I truly need a break from all these high school minded kids, and I can't wait to graduate. People keep telling me there're people like this everywhere, but I honestly never saw them during my summer internship. Yea we're not the most selective college, and why should I expect anything better? Should have worked harder in high school and attended somewhere else better."

Recently, my heart has been filled a ton of sadness. It just feels like a burden. I just want to cry and cry forever. But, I'm just going to put on the smiling mask and go out because no one cares about my problems. That's one thing this place has taught me: people have their own problems to deal with and don't want to deal with anyone else's. So, its just better to bury them. Hopefully, this doesn't hurt my health. Is this depression or me being a whiny bitch? Probably me being a bitch. Everything is just feels sad and mellow."

There are a few people in my major that I envy so much that I almost hate them. Not because of anything they've done, but just because I'm so jealous of the support and love they are surrounded with. They post on their facebook about how they're so thankful for how amazing Cornell's been, and they have parents and family members and friends commenting about how happy they are for them, and how they deserve all of their success and happiness. They post collages of them and their friends, and write about how much they look forward to seeing their family and friends back home, but how they'll also miss all of the friends they've made here at Cornell. 
I know I'm just being petty and selfish, but the end of the year always reminds me of how alone I have been for another entire year. I wish I had someone in my corner. I also really want a hug."

Why does Cornell keep asking me for money when they have a $7 billion endowment and I still have 90K in student loans. It honestly adds insult to injury a little. It's a private organization that charges an absurd amount for a product. The product is okay, but still it's not like it's a charity. Apple doesn't call me to ask for a donation because I spent $1200 on a laptop and it's a good computer. If anything I should be asking them for money. I'm poor, I qualify for charity. You made an insane amount of money off of me, maybe give some back? I can invest it in a family rather than redo the roof of some building for the 3rd time in the last 5 years."

I was an average student at Cornell and felt totally mediocre.  I couldn't get into the top med schools that I wanted because of my GPA and didn't get into my in state school, so I was going to have to take on more debt at a mid tier state school in the Midwest (far from family and friends, not where I wanted to be).

I just finished up my first year and I have a 3.9 GPA, am class president, and was recruited into a concurrent PhD program that will pay for the rest of med school.  There's a big fish: pond ratio skew at Cornell.  Even if you feel like a loser here, you go out into a different environment and realize you are smarter, harder working, and better prepared than you thought.  Keep your chin up!"

I've been hooking up with one of my guy friends for a while. At first, very occasionally. Then not at all for a while this year because I was dating someone and he was hooking up with someone else. But since spring break it's been pretty regular, and I'm struggling to figure out what to do because I'm really starting to like him as more than a friend or a FWB. I know he doesn't feel the same way about me at all. Not that he doesn't like me, because we really are friends, but he just doesn't feel that way about me. I don't know if I should broach the subject (probably a very bad idea), stop hooking up with him or, more likely, keep fucking him and being friends and letting my silly desperate angst slowly eat away at me. Because I know it's only a matter of time before he finds someone he likes more and it's all over. 

Moral of the story: FWBs never works and I am going to die alone."

Have you ever listened to a song you used to listen to in the past but stopped? It always brings back this weird nostalgic feeling and I begin to think of how I was in the past. Like if I listen to a song from HS or freshman year of college I start thinking about myself during that time period and how much I've changed....how much I've stayed the same. I know I'm making it sound all romantic and what not, but it's kind of a shitty depressing feeling. I just feel so alone all the time. I want to be a kid again and relive my life. Whenever I think of happy memories I'm almost always depressed because that happy moment has passed. Whenever I think of sad memories I'm also depressed. I just need someone to talk to about my feelings, ya know?

Sex is really enjoyable to me, and also important in my feeling close to someone. Problem is, I'm going out with someone who doesn't seem to have any conception of sex at all. They're really wonderful and sweet, but at times, it's difficult for me. I definitely don't want to force the idea at all, and I'm sure I can keep this up.

A Dragon Day Shirt Purchase:

That's all it takes. One tiny, tiny, irrelevant event. Then, without warning, I'm hooked.

I'm sorry pretty lady. Sorry that I only had to buy a shirt from you. 

Well, it wasn't just the shirt. 

At the time, I had looked upon the thirsty pack of dogs that were my friends, all of whom were also vying for your attention, and then I had looked upon your face. Immediately, I knew what you knew: shirts were not why my friends had stuck around and listened to your sales pitch. 

""Why add to her misery,"" I thought to myself. So I decided to actually buy a shirt, maintaining my business-like, disinterested, almost asexual persona. This demeanor serves me well and keeps me safe from myself, specifically my propensity for outlandish and inexplicable infatuation. And it worked. I forgot about you quite easily, at least for a while.

Then, weeks later, we locked eyes on the slope. You were inebriated, so far as I could tell, a gorgeous freshman Archie enjoying her first Slope Day. And here is where the true apology comes.

You wouldn't remember, but you smiled (or gushed, or blushed, or some combination of the 3), pointed at my shirt and yelled ""Dragon!!"" 

Sweet, but meaningless, in the end. Just a subconscious recognition and drunken shout. 

Still, that's all it takes for me. I caught a crush, one that I'm sure will be gone as quickly as it arrived. For the moment, though, it's here. I'm sorry, for I know the pain I can cause. I'm sorry that you had to ever come into contact with me and become an unwilling object of unwanted affection. Desire is cruel to both parties.

Fortunately for both of us, the chances of me pursuing you are almost nonexistent, due to...shall we say...logistics, to put it simply. Hahaha.

I fall in love easily, even though I know that I have never been in love. In other words, I willingly allow infatuation to overcome me on a regular basis. My friends find this hilarious, and--despite my constant failed endeavors--so do I. Like a psychopath who absolutely refuses to understand morality and thus redeem himself or herself, I absolutely refuse to learn from my mistakes. I laugh them off with ease.

Yet, interestingly enough, when I commit myself to being my normal self, I am extremely successful. People, even attractive women, love me, as long as there is no emotion on the line. Only when I commit myself to being attracted to someone do I make the most hilarious (or horrendous, depending on your point of view) mistakes.

It's a strange, seemingly inevitable paradox that comes with being me.

Anyway, be glad you've escaped some particularly cringe-worthy interactions/experiences. So many others have fallen prey to my stupidity, ill-advised decisions, Facebook messages (oh the Facebook messages, don't even get me started,) cowardly/ambiguous texts, awkwardly handled friendships, and more and more and more and worse and worse and worse.

Be glad, pretty lady, that you have escaped. Enjoy your Summer. Oh, and one more thing:

DRAGON!! :) :) :)"

I make for a pretty ungrateful piece of shit son.  I almost didn't call my mother on mother's day.  I barely call my parents at all.  They usually have to call me.  It's not that I hate my parents.  I just hate talking on the phone.  But it gets worse.  When I see the posts of ""I wuv my parents oh so vewy vewy much"", I can never imagine myself saying that.  I almost don't really know how to show compassion to my parents anymore.  Perhaps it's a guy thing.  Perhaps the stress of Cornell has just turned me cold and bitter.  Perhaps I'm just an asshole who can't appreciate what his parents have done for him.  Who knows :/"

I don't understand why you just can't say, ""No, I'm not interested,"" instead of doing exactly what you said you wouldn't do: say nothing. Someone claiming to be a humanist should know better.

I walked past Art Deco Riley Robb Hall built in the 1950's and saw a 1957 Chevy with a Labrador Retriever sitting in the front. I was listening to my 50's playlist. It could not have been a more perfect day. It reminded me of how great the 1950's were when the chrome was thick. I can't wait to get back home and slow dance with my girlfriend to 50's love songs......when I focus on the simpler times in America I remain happy. Otherwise if I focus on today and the rogue presidency, I get depressed. Going on a 1950's memory lane and looking at nostalgia is my drug-my antidepressant."

There's this guy - no, there was this guy. We became pretty close despite all of my warning bells going off; he had liked me in the past but I thought 'it's been a while, I'm sure he's over me by now!' Anyways, we became really close, talking a lot, texting a lot, going out a lot. All of my friends told me that he liked me but I chose not to believe them because for once in my life, I wanted to have a guy friend who didn't end up wanting to be more than friends. Well, all my plans were blown to hell because he told me he liked me and I didn't know what to do. I'm broken, you see, I hadn't really had non-platonic feelings towards anyone since my last relationship. I hung on to memories and could-have-beens and though I'm slowly healing, at that time, I couldn't give my friend what he wanted; I couldn't tell him I liked him back. After a while, our texting became less regular - my fault really, I became insanely busy - and he took it to be that I couldn't handle being his friend after he confessed his feelings. At some point, he just stopped texting; I guess he had had enough of me. Now, we're reduced to glancing at each other when we think the other isn't looking; avoiding each other whenever we can. I wish I could go back to the beginning. I wish I could somehow find a way to not end up this way. 
This semester I learned a lot about myself. I finally made a guy friend and it's completely platonic on both sides. He brings so many positive things to my life. I also went on a couple dates with a really great guy, found that I could feel again. I don't want to go back in time and go out with the guy from my past, I wasn't ready then. I just wish that we had become close now, when I'm ready to feel again. I wish I didn't hurt him, I wish he didn't hurt me. I wish we could still laugh together over our caffeine addictions. Everything's changed now, we can't go back to what we were; there's too much history between us. Still, some day, I hope we can bump into each other and have a nice conversation instead of sidelong glances and pretending not to see the other."

Looking back at it, I kinda did treat you bad. I was very selfish and some would say I actwe like I took you for granted. Did you deserve better? I don't know, I didn't see much worth in you either way."

Life would be so much easier if I were smart. I'm tired of hearing the sympathetic ""Oh, but you got into Cornell!"" speech. It doesn't say sh*t about my intelligence. It only shows my ability to work hard and conform to the already-mediocre American school system. At Cornell, I'm average, and sadly, I have to work pretty hard to maintain that spot.Often, I see my peers who didn't go to fancy colleges do great things, and I'm suddenly ashamed that I came here. What a waste of tuition. Here, I'm tossed to the side because I'm not good enough. Not good enough to get an internship, not good enough to TA, be a part of a project team, anything. I want to do something meaningful with my life, but I feel frustrated because I haven't found what that is yet. I've literally had people ignore me or my efforts to help them because I wasn't ""capable"" enough in their eyes, and that was such a harsh blow to the ego. On top of all this, it doesn't help being an introvert either. I constantly struggle to have my voice heard, and I struggle to make the ""connections"" so many people form effortlessly. I just want to go home."

Okay.  I feel a little bad saying I hate it, but I'm really not happy with it right now.  I saved a goddamn word document.  I HIT SAVE.  And then I went to submit said word document on blackboard, AND I COULD NOT FIND SAID WORD DOCUMENT ANYWHERE ON MY COMPUTER.  Not in downloads, not in documents, not in trash, not in the spotlight search.

Some of you people need to get your fucking heads out of your asses and realize there are other ways to build experience than getting a fucking internship. BELIEVE IT OR NOT there are these things called summer jobs that NORMAL college students do rather than some prestigious internship. Additionally, BELIEVE IT OR NOT 100% of Cornell can't get these internships because they're selective so IF YOU DON'T FIND AN INTERNSHIP GET A FUCKING JOB THAT WILL HELP YOU GET AN INTERNSHIP NEXT SUMMER GOD FUCKING DAMMIT I AM SICK OF HEARING ALL THE COMPLAINING I LITERALLY GOT MY INTERNSHIP BY TELLING THE INTERVIEWER ABOUT HOW I USED TO WORK THREE SHITTY JOBS WHILE GOING TO SCHOOL"

But to the really tall guy at slope day that whispered in my ear and said something along the lines of "" oh you should be jumping more to the music"". I was the girl with the kimono. I just want to say thank you. I don't feel like guys like me here, and although you probably were not flirting with me, I just want to say thanks for making it look like you were at least <3 ...I should've just kissed you and not given a fuck about it."

I think the best compliment someone can give me is telling me that I'm kind. I don't know why, but it makes me happy that people see me as kind, and as someone who they can trust.

If you like someone but don't have the time to hang out with them atm, then just text them to let them know you're still interested.  Not keeping up with people, especially after a date or hangout, implies you don't really like them."

I am a horrible person. 
All my life, I prided myself to be a good person. I suck at my field, I am not going to do well in a job even if I get hired by someone. I am not attractive and probably will die alone or settle for the first available option. Through all this, I used to think that maybe my niceness and my honesty are good things that will take me somewhere. Now I realize, I am not even nice. I am consumed by burning jealousy, hating people I love for being better than me at talking to people, or making friends. I tell myself I have social anxiety, that's why I cant talk to people I don't know or make friends, but that's just an excuse. I am loser! That's why people don't talk to me. And my friends suffer through my constant whining because.... I don't know why! Perhaps they feel sorry for me, or maybe they don't want to look bad. I care for people and immediately feel bad for doing it because I expect people to do the same for me. That is not caring. I hate it when my friends have other friends, because it reminds me how I am incapable of making friends or making people like me. I am enraged and jealous that my friends get hit on regularly by boys, when I haven't even been looked at once. I can't be genuinely happy for anyone when something good happens to them, because I am jealous that nothing ever works for me. But I still lend the shoulder to cry on for people because I feel important when I make them feel better. I am a horrible person and nothing will ever change that"

We had great conversations at first but now I feel like things have gotten slightly awkward for some reason.  I felt so comfortable talking to you and now I feel like the potential is still there but there's some sort of barrier holding you back.  Just be straight with me and I think things could workout.  I don't like the surface talk, have a real conversation with me.  Tell me what you're really thinking."

I cannot wait until the summer after graduate from Cornell. Imma buy myself a new Chevy pickup truck or a Jeep Wrangler and I can drive down beautiful Pennsylvania country roads without worrying about school work for the first time, listening to Toby Keith's Should've Been a Cowboy or Made in America. I will go up to the Poconos with my girlfriend and we can have a bonfire and drink a couple of beers. I can't wait until I get home to start my vegetable field, ride my tractor, and go to the range and chill down by plincking at a few cans and targets each week with my AR or my Marlin '22. Oh, the country life I have missed all winter is coming soon again. Just have to get through 2 more weeks. B|"

This semester was extremely challenging and rough. I was having really bad emotional breakdowns and getting lots of pressure from my academic performances. I was so stressed that I almost dropped out of all the organizations I belonged and from the friends circle. Although it was hard, this really made me realize who really cared about me and who didn't. I just wanted to thank those of you who really cared and supposed me through this semester <3"

You're stunning, beautiful, perhaps one of the most amazing girls I've met in my entire life. I was seriously thinking of starting to really pursue you, but then I saw that guy you've started hanging around with. A lot.

You say you want to be with me and we're perfect for each other but if I don't text you... we don't talk. If you have never once in your life text the person you like first.... then don't be surprised when they don't acknowledge you as part of their life."
2225,2015-05-08 20:55:20,"5825
I made the biggest mistake of my life coming to Cornell for grad studies. With no internship over the summer I have no hope of getting a job to repay my student debt. I got out of a long term relationship before coming here and I thought this would be a new beginning, a chance to change my life, start over and be happy and may be find someone in the process. Turns out, life is worse than ever. How can one semester, one huge slump in the gpa erase every accomplishment and piece of hard work you have done all your life and put you in a position where you are drowning in debt with no hope whatsoever. I wish I had never been giving admission in the first place and then I wouldn't have been tempted to put everything on the line to be here. Is this what everyone calls fate? destiny? If yes, I can feel the hard punch in my face"
2226,2015-05-08 20:31:21,"5824
I think you're really awesome person to talk to, and would love to ask you out although we only talked once. In fact, my friend really wants me to date you because we both are busy people, and it was our busy schedules that our previous partners couldn't cope with. But I don't wanna ask you out because we are in the same classes and it'd suck if it doesn't work out. Moreover, you're more outgoing than I am, so I'd only bring you down. Still, I'm looking forward to interacting with you in the rest of the years here at Cornell..."

I think more people at this school should openly express their emotions to each other. Show your happiness, show your sadness, show your mania, show you. I honestly love to cry--from a god hit of Lauryn Hill to looking at the gorges to watching the birds. Life is so goddamn beautiful (even when it does suck), and everyone should feel open and entitled to share their feelings with one another. And this is not just for males; this is for females, too.

Shed a tear; break a smile; don't forget to tell a friend that they mean the world to you."
2229,2015-05-08 20:12:27,"5821
I know I'm incredibly intelligent, beautiful, and blessed with amazing relationships that enrich my life. And for all this, I'm incredibly grateful. Yet I feel like if I told anyone about my dark reality, they'd leave me. My dad died at a time where I hadn't been allowed to speak to him for the past year and a half. I live everyday with the guilt of letting him die without telling him I love him, all while questioning if he loved me. 
My mom has been broken ever since, and treats everything I do with jealousy, actively sabotaging my plans and giving no support. I like to tell myself she' changed since my dad died, but maybe she's always been like this. I hate to think I give her pain from her own immaturity, and I hate to feel sad for myself that neither my dad or mom can be a role model. 
I don't know if my deep insecurity and belief that no one could ever love me stems from my self hatred, parental neglect, or reality; but, it's a tough reality to live with everyday. I feel ungrateful for all I have, but I feel so doubtful and unloved. You have no idea how lucky you are to have someone to rely on, a back up plan. I have none. No one who would help me when something goes wrong or family to complain to, even. Oh, and probably substantially contributed to the fact I'm in love with an emotionally detached, fucked up  boy who I can't muster up the courage to talk to anyway.
On the other hand, shout out to my amazing Cornell fam who spends breaks with me and helps me when my own family won't, even if I can't tell you my secrets. It's not your fault."
2230,2015-05-08 20:36:29,"5820
Ever since I was young I've always been perceptive to how people felt just by interacting with them. I noticed that I could tell what kind of day a person had been having without even having them say anything. With this skill I try to interact with people to gear the conversation to them feeling better, but lately, I've felt like I've been neglecting my own well-being this whole time. I've been focusing so much on others that I haven't been able to notice how soul-crushingly depressed I am. I want to explode and see all that comes out."
2231,2015-05-08 20:24:34,"5819
This semester I found some truly great friends from those living around me. While I'm forever appreciative and grateful to them for befriending me and giving me an actual social circle, I really want to see more people outside of them. But hanging out with them has made me anti-social to an extreme, and because none of them would go out, neither would I. I feel horrible if I ditch this group for another, since I don't like abandoning friends and I don't like friends abandoning me, but the truth is, I don't want to be a hermit for all my college experience."
2232,2015-05-08 20:09:35,"5818
So transitioning to Cornell has been very hard and I still can't say that I feel like I fit in. I have had trouble with my classes and have had suicidal thoughts & depressive feelings on top of finding it hard to make friends. I feel like I'm now only happy when I'm drunk, at a party, hooking up with someone or when someone shows some kind of interest in me... :| ... I won't give up though...
 here's to a hopefully good end of the semester and a better school year next year for us all!"

It's been almost a year and I am still not over you. I sometimes hope that I will hear from you out of nowhere but then I know that after what I said the last time we talked about us, you probably don't want anything to do with me. You moved on but I haven't. When I saw you the other day, I couldn't help but think that maybe you were right when you said we were not meant to be together and I should stop waiting for you to come back to me."

I've never not gotten a job offer after interviewing. I've also never faked an answer to a question. If they ask me one and I don't actually know... I say ""I don't actually know that much about that but I would love the opportunity to learn"". Boom hired. As i've gone through college, the amount of questions I can't answer has gone down because now I've found the answers."

My boyfriend just messaged me apologizing for something he almost did, and thought by telling me and apologizing, it would make the situation better. Truth is, I would have found out about it eventually, and this is one more thing on a long list of his mistakes.

""The herpetology exam I took yesterday was INSANE. It is super discouraging and annoying that I made fair amount of effort in a subject I am passionate about, and it cannot even guarantee me an S grade. 

Somebody should tell them that the way they make exam questions are absolutely unacceptable. The exam is filled with essay questions like """"Explain what blah is""""""""compare and contrast such and such"""", or even letting us retell an anecdote mentioned in class. No learning objectives. No study sheets. No review sessions. So we are supposed to memorize every single word on lecture slides, including those latin names of families/species, and fancy words related to anatomical structures. This is impossible for a non-major, a non-native English speaker, or a graduating senior with little time (all true for me!). They are test-running learning machines instead of evaluating students. 

I learned that the professor's teaching this course for the first time. I wish to do two things: asking them to give me a big hand, and point out that the exam is not fair.  How should I do this two things together without irritating them? (Unfortunately, I've already submitted course evaluation last week)"""

We have such great conversations in person, which is probably the more important part. But when you respond to questions over text, it hurts. I wish electronic communication wasn't so important, because it's objectively sort of pointless, but we live in an age where it's a big deal. It makes me wonder what will happen when we can't see each other in person over the summer. Will you just disappear?"

I never posted on this before but i feel like I need some way to vent. I am tired of sitting in class surrounded by faces that don't look like mine. I am tired of spending endless hours studying material for exams alone because I do not fit in as an engineer. I am tired of recieving failing grades on exams that I put hours of studying into. I am tired of drowning my sorrow in alcohol because I do not feel comfortable sharing my feelings with my friends. I am tired of waking up everyday with no motivation to do anythig. I feel like I am going through serious depression but i can't tell anyone because I am a man and men are suppose to be ""strong"". I feel like this may be my last semester here because I am going to fail out. I am so afraid to go back home, where everyone had so much faith in me because I made it out and into an Ivy League school, just to tell them I failed. These past few weeks suicide has been on my mind so often. I know i can not go through with it because it would devastate my mother and brother but I really just wish i could walk away from it all. Do not tell me about how I shouldn't kill myself because I know from first hand experience how much suicide affects those around you, but I can't help that these thoughts come to mind. I need God now more than ever but I feel the least connected with Him at the moment. If you read all this thank you. There was no point to my post, I just needed to tell someone how I feel."

Not at all that his actions were justified, but I can understand how he ended up with his beliefs. He was unable to live with the kind of discrimination I've learned to deal with, but it's sad. Both for the victims and Elliot Rodger. Dear white people, end racism- it isn't good for any of us.

Although I feel like I should support the multiple social causes being protested around campus, I've been turned away by the complete incompetence of the students protesting. Their intentions are respectable, but their methods are honestly just embarrassing. Taking your social causes to Skorton's retirement party? Shame on you, and have some decency. I'll make my own personal effort to be socially responsible, but the social activism groups on campus that I would have liked to join have alienated their peers by acting just as entitled and immature as those they hope to educate."

I have no idea why I came here. Almost all the people I knew that were vastly inferior to me academically went to state or local schools. They all graduated college with high GPA's and got accepted into high paying jobs into the six figures. I know I'm not entitled to anything just because of my school's name. But it irks me to no end when an idiot high school bully will probably end up doing better than me. I hate my life."

""Today I received what was perhaps one of the most outrageous emails in my academic career. One engineering professor emailed a group of students saying that they incorrectly completed an assignment, and specifically instructed us not to seek assistance regarding why we did poorly. The reasoning was because we would """"delay us [him and TA's]"""" from grading and other course related work.

All I can say is, how dare you. It is inexcusable for any professor to ever claim that they do not have time for their own students. Especially at a university that touts the quality of its education and instructors. """

I think there are (not so) secret societies, just for black people, forming on campus. I've seen people in hoods with masks or head scarves on north campus and ho plaza surround by a bunch of other black people. I don't really think it's a problem but it seems pretty cult like. 

[Pretty sure those are initiation ceremonies for MGLC Greek organizations. White Greek organizations probably do the same thing, but behind closed doors. Could be wrong]"

 I want to become a cop after I graduate, but everyone I know tells me I would be a loser to waste my education like that. They said a Cornell education is costly and if I wanted to become a cop I should've gone to a state school, where they actually have a criminal justice major. I don't know but I don't like the feeling of an office job. I want to be out in the field bringing criminals, especially drug dealers, to justice and making the world a safer place. It gives me more satisfaction than just a regular office job. Plus there is action everything and each and everyday is different, rather than the same with a menial office job."

I am so scared of my life. I have spent the last one month crying alone in my room. To be honest this is the most I've been stressed. Being kicked out of Cornell because of my low grades scares me. Rising sophomore with no specific major in mind. I don't mean I didn't have a major in mind before coming here but the requirements are way too much for me and I find myself spending all my entire week in the library- and then the grades come out,still bad. I have started hating everything, everyone and Cornell in general. I can't pretend it's okay when for sure am losing it. Even after confessing I'm still scared. I don't want to graduate and still go back to being poor."

I don’t know why I am writing this, maybe I just want to vent or have someone I know read it and know it’s me. Ever since the beginning of this semester an emptiness has been growing inside of me. I have tried to fill it drugs and alcohol but they only alleviate the feeling for a while, then it just returns as if nothing changed. It is funny, I have even tried going to the library to alleviate the emptiness, and maybe if I had something to do to work at it would fill it somehow. I feel so purposeless as if I do not have a reason to exist I have no calling. Everyone I know has a passion a something they are passionate about but I do not I find nothing interesting the only thing that gets me by is a rush of adrenaline a façade of being edgy. It is almost as if the edginess of my persona will make the emptiness acceptable as a role to fulfill."

It's been really hard working up the nerve to share this confession with the world, but imagining the relief I'll feel once I hit """"submit"""" makes it all worth it. My confession is thus:

I have a hard time getting homework done on the weekends, even though I have no issue devoting all my time to it. 
Anyone else have this problem? What do you do to get your brain buzzing on your off days? Comment below, please! :)

My brain and body just function slowly come Saturday, and come Sunday night I never quite know what I did during the weekend other than eating some meals and doing some class and clerical stuff that appear to have taken all day. On Friday, I make a list of what needs to get done. I usually have zero to two extracurricular activities scheduled for Friday evening, Saturday and Sunday combined, and I never imbibe. I like all my classes, so my work is generally fun for me. I can rarely say, """"At least I got distracted by fun stuff, or things that are important to me"""", because I usually don't do those things until I complete my school checklist (though I've started to now, just to use the time somehow). Homework always comes first, but that doesn't make it come fast."

At first, I would just notice how convoluted concepts trickled from his lips like poetry, ringing with spectacular clarity, as he patiently taught me and then I noticed his kindness, his humor, maturity and his distinctly European style and now I dream of sparks engulfing us. My nerves are restless. I wish I could shout- it's you. It has always been you. This is no longer some insignificant puppy crush. But you're graduating this year. And maybe by next year we will be strangers again."

You’re here so close just a few miles away. I could go visit you anytime but I’m not sure if I can. I hate you I really do. Maybe hate isn’t the right word I resent you. I resent everything you put me through growing up without you. No concrete memory of you just figments made up about you from things I discovered about you. But I can’t blame you no matter how much I want to. I shouldn’t hate you because you and I are nothing. There is no connection not any shared time.  I do have one question for you. When you held me when you were there and I was there for those slight moment our lives crossed each other’s did you love me like any parent loves their child. But did you love me? Did I have any sort of impact in your life? Because your absence had a huge impact on my life but did my absence affect yours. Did you feel anything the moment you first held me and looked at me? Did you feel warmth or love that I was your baby a small innocent creature in your hands? Were you protective of me did you have the instincts of a father or not? I really do not care about how complicated your situation was or how I could never understand.  Why did you not look after me indirectly or from afar? Why abandon me? In the end running away didn’t prevent karma from catching up to you. Did you love your other kids? Or are you some sort of sociopath? Who care only about himself? I’ll ask you all these questions if I face you but I don’t know if I’ll be able to. Facing you will be me acknowledging a ghost. Someone who haunts my mind but isn’t there only a figment of my imagination by facing you I will be making you a reality, an actual person with a voice to answer all these doubts and questions. I’m glad that all those millions did not help your fate in the end, good luck in prison where your money does not matter."

I think that our school's group of student protesters regularly go too far... I understand that there are problems with Cornell's administration, and I understand that as students with the right to freedom of speech you can respond to injustice however you want, but your actions are distasteful to many students who would otherwise join you. Setting up rallies of screaming activists, verbally abusing our administrators, shouting down the people who try to answer your questions... that's not the kind of thing that draws more people to your cause. Changing your methods would earn you a much larger support base, and learning how to approach injustice with professionalism will serve you well later in life. If you think this kind of reaction would succeed in your future workplace, you're going to find yourself fired. I'm just a student who wants to be an activist but doesn't feel that the movement represents him. Your message may be awesome, but if your methods aren't, then you haven't got anything to offer people like me."

There were so many things I wanted to do at Cornell but depression and social anxiety held me back. Now I'm a junior and I'm more comfortable with getting involved with clubs in the fall but it's so hard to so as a senior. I'm so mad at myself for missing all my chances freshman year. I hate having mental health problems."
2277,2015-05-03 13:43:57,"5773
I want what we had without the stress and anxiety. I think that after I graduate and leave the Cornell bubble that I could find someone who is better for my mental health, because I don't know any girls here (or really anybody) who aren't constantly stressed, unless they're high or drunk or whatever. But I don't know that there is someone better, and I don't want to throw what we have away if we both can just get over the stress. Maybe that's why so many Cornell couples marry - they've already dealt with the stress of dating at Cornell, and it prepares them well for the unexpected struggles you have to anticipate with marriage."

I suspect one of my classmates is transgendered. I always referred to them as ""he"", today I discovered someone else referred to them as ""she"". I realized that I was potentially causing great offense to my classmate. I want to refer to them by their preferred gender pronoun (or if they prefer, none at all) but I don't know how to ask them. I think that person is amazingly kind, incredibly wise and very supportive, which makes my not knowing what they prefer feel worse. They deserve a space space and I am mortified by the thought that I may be unknowingly making things difficult for them."

You admitted it was your fault, and that I was great to you, but that makes it worse. It means that there is nothing I can do to fix this, and that me being ""amazing"" is still not enough for you to care about me or my feelings. I guess it is my fault in the end, I wasn't made to be cared about, no matter how hard I tryed."

I don't care anymore. Your actions spoke louder than your words. I shouldn't have to tell you when I'm upset, I don't hide it. You should care enough to recognize it instead of ignoring it. But thats what you do isn't it, something happens, and instead of facing it, you avoid it or try to make a joke out of it. So I'm going to follow your lead and not care. Your going to need me, and I'm going to do what you do, say I will be there, and at the last possible second, when you feel that relief for all the emotions you are feeling is almost there, I will tell you I can't be there,and I hope you realize how badly you messed up."

As a black person, it saddens me to see the events unfolding in Baltimore right now.  I understand their frustration with the lack of accountability for police officers and the demand for justice, but damaging property, looting innocent businesses, and attacking others is not the solution.  Such acts are barbaric and do nothing to remedy the situation.  Everyone must realize that this reaction isn't a reflection of an entire race but of an tiny percentage of black people who are acting on their frustration and anger in an entirely misguided and wrong manner.  Do not discredit the black cause for equality due to the actions of these people."

I'm alienating my last two ""friends"" here.  Friends.  Yeah right.  One admitted that we have little in common.  If we were not in the same suite last year, we would never have had reason to talk to each other.  Nor would we much tolerate each other, I think.  The other...she only talked to me because she pitied me.  Well, fuck em.  Don't need no pity.  Soon this semester will end and I'll go back home.  At least I can be depressed and alone without having to see other people enjoying their time here.  Or at least people who don't go to bed each night trying to figure out the best method of suicide.  Fuck those people.  Fuck me for coming here.  No point in even thinking about transferring.  Broken as I am, nowhere and nothing can really improve my state of mind."

I am DYING to date again. I broke up with my last boyfriend in 2011 and I'm still single. It's not that I need a man. Granted I have my feelings of inadequacy, and days where I just feel so unloved and alone, but I know I can survive and even be happy *gasp* on my own. I have done it for three years now. It's just that I want to be with someone, hold hands, have amazing sex, kiss and cuddle, watch movies with, have arguments with.... basically the whole relationship stuff. I am not asking to find THE ONE, even though I am probably ""old enough"". I am not looking for a serious commitment or a man to save me, but I just want someone I can be with and be myself with. Tinder is an option, but I always thought I wasn't desperate enough. Maybe I am. Maybe I am but I just won't admit it, I guess. I thought graduate school would be a new beginning, a new chance of finding someone who might see me through the haze of work, stress and the cold. But I guess I was wrong. What a way to end the year!"

You got back with him again. You are my best friend, and he used to be my close friend. He had been treating you like shit, not in the r/niceguys sense but like actual shit: insulting your family, your religion, cheating on you with your friends, and emotionally blackmailing you by threatening suicide and more histrionics when you were getting discouraged from what he did. You came to me so often so very depressed, and I'd do everything in my power to cheer you up and bring you back to the old self that I became friends with. He even interpreted that as ""his friend moving in on his girl"" or some BS and tried bringing me to the point that I had a lamp cord hanging out of my window during finals weekend and was about to go. The only reason why I didn't was because you found my goodbye message when I was on the windowsill.

I thought we were both free of him. You seemed so much more open, so happy, to the point that I really believed things were looking up not just for me, who turned my life around and removed him from it, but you too. Even though I try not to admit it and it undermines my stance, I kinda fell for you. Not that you'll ever know that again.

And then a few nights ago I check some social media I don't check often and see he's mentioning you casually just like he used to and things are okay again. ""He doesn't really mean to hurt me when he does"" this is the fourth time it's happened! Each successively time you fall harder, and now without my knowledge you've gotten back together with him? I get that I don't have to know everything about your life and I don't expect to, but I don't think I'm entitled in being told that you're getting back with a guy who has not ruined your life once but three times.

And now you act all distant again. I didn't try moving beyond friends out of respect for you: why did you let a guy who cheated on you and did all of this bullshit once again take your heart? At the very least I hope you can keep me as a friend, and even though I'm trying to move on from you and maybe love again in the future that doesn't mean I won't try to save you and be a pillar when you need it.

Good luck. You still have me and our friendship if anything happens."

I'm not right for this place.  I got into Cornell pretty randomly and decided to come because it was the most prestigious name on my list of acceptances.  I didn't know what I wanted to do with my life and I figured maybe I'd find that out while I'm here.  Maybe I'd discover my passion for music or biology or management, I thought.  I was apprehensive but I went along with it for two years because I didn't really have an alternative.  I've been told my entire life that college will be the defining factor in my life, that a degree will pave the path to success, that my time here will prepare me to make a real difference in the world.  

The thing is, I don't care about making a difference in the world.  I've spent my entire life trying to have as little impact on people as possible.  I don't want to be an actor in the spectacle of life.  I just want to sit in the audience and let it all soak in.  I want to be able to up and vanish like a fart in the wind and leave no trace of my existence.  I want to put on a good playlist and drive along the California coast, and at night I'd sleep in the back of my car on the beach, listening to the waves tumble onto the sand and retreat again.  And in the morning I'd retreat again to some other location--maybe up the coast, maybe across the country--that has no memory of me, and this is how I'd live.  It's no investment banking or here-I-am-to-change-the-world career that most Cornell students seem to covet, but it's what I dream of every night."

You say you still love me, but you choose to break up with me anyway. I have trouble believing that. If you truly loved me, you should have at least told me and we could have worked on it. Aren't we supposed to fight for those we love? I know I did. Whatever issue I had (which wasn't often), I communicated it to you, and we worked it out.

The breakup is super painful as it is, but it stings even more that you chose to walk away from a very good relationship. I wish you had at least tried because even if we broke up anyway, I know at least you valued what we had. I wouldn't feel as worthless, either."

The mob that conglomerated today by Bailey Hall shocked me. As an alumnus of this fine institution, and someone who actually donates money to the financial aid fund here, I felt very offended and  uneasy. Luckily one Cornell Police officer and one State trooper walked with me across the quad so that I could make it on my way without being hassled. All goes to show, remember who you display such offensive material to, as alumni like me are the ones who actually benefit students like yourselves and are the reason why Cornell is fortunate to have such an endowment that could go to financial aid for students. Charter Day was an event for a large number of alumni this weekend. The only persons that actually were affected by the demonstration were Cornell alumni and like I mentioned before those are the ""good people"" who actually make it easier for you to go here."

I bought myself an alarm clock because I hated having to encounter my phone after leaving my dream world every morning. I hear the ticking of it. The rough striking of it almost seems to take over my room but I need it to remind myself that I shouldn't drown myself in nothingness anymore. Every moment counts.

Yet I made sure to turn the alarm clock off when I planned for you to come here. The sensation of time dissipating visits me when you are here. I do not need any other senses. No sounds, no visuals, no scents, no tastes. Not even your touch. Your presence gives me a strange sensation. It is almost as if I am returning to the woods. I am at ease and there is nothing else I want. 

But there are just some things I cannot say. Momentary thoughts linger until they leave my mind for good. All you will be is memory and all we were will be a memory. A beautiful memory and I am so okay with it."

     Sometimes I feel like people don't understand me. People feel that I am ignorant for not sharing their ideas.  I came to this country for a  better education than the one offered in my country. I love to learn. I like the fact I will be educated in the future. That's what people don't get from me: All I care about is my education.

      American students, specially kids here in this so called ""Ivy League"" school live their lives up to ""that GPA"". They take a class and all the time they are thinking of their GPAs. If they don't do a HW, they fear their GPA will be affected blah blah blah. Yes, I do care about my GPA but not that much (yes before you attack me my GPA is very low) but the point I want to get across is that GPA is not the only door opener; you can be successful regardless of what your GPA is.

      I am a vivid example of that. I am a researcher (yea that's because I like to learn), and a student in Engineering. There are tons of opportunities that aren't open to me at Cornell just because I don't have that high GPA that supposedly is required but let me tell you you can do much more without having a high GPA. I have gotten accepted to research programs and internships that students with a 3.7 or above have been rejected to, such as research positions in other Ivy Leagues and internships in NASA. You may not believe me but it's true; you can get accepted to any program you want as long as you write an excellent application and show that you know your stuff through your essays and statements and that all you care is about learning and not an internship to just show on a stupid paper saying ""I DID THIS AND THAT"" then get a job after graduation. That's the key to internships and research positions; you can't just say ""OH I HAVE A HIGH GPA AND I DESERVE THIS BECAUSE OF THAT"".  

To conclude, to those out there struggling finding internships and/or research positions for this Summer, don't feel bad for rejections and don't feel bad because you don't have a high GPA. While I do want you to do good and work as hard as possible (my low gpa is no indicator of my hard work), I do want you to care for your learning. When you fail or get a below the mean on a prelim, don't feel bad. Just think that there is something that you are missing and find that ""something"". Grades are not indicator of who you are as a person, or indicator of your hard work. However, if you do care for your learning, embrace it, and dedicate yourself into it. Education lasts forever, GPAs don't. 

Lastly, if you don't share my point, I respect it and please respect mine. I do prefer someone knowledgeable with a low GPA than someone with a high GPA that got an A in a class that he/she forgot after taking the final. I invite you to invest in your learning and take the advantage of this opportunity you have been given at this school. If you don't like to learn and you are here for a high GPA then a good job, this was not meant for you. 

P.S. Look at famous people around. Gates was a Harvard drop-out. Einstein was thought to be mentally disabled and got bad grades in school. Newton, the same."

I don't want to tell my SO about the bad parts of my life. Not things like school or social life, but the actual dark details. Things that actually mattered. I've dealt with most of them, and they're now in the past, yet I feel uneasy when I think about them finding out. I don't want them to see that side of me."

I went to Gannett yesterday to talk to CAPS because I am very sad and I cry every night now that I will be graduating and leaving Cornell. I spent the last 5 years here, and I finished an undergrad and graduate degree here and I love it so much that my life will never be as great as when I was a student here. I feel like shit and don't know what to do. :/ I'm gonna miss this one friend I have who's still an undergrad here, since I can tell her anything and I know she won't judge me."

My mom sewed our clothes by hand while working 2 jobs. Please tell me what was so hard in your life? Expectations? Oh, I had those too. Why do you think I'm at Cornell? Just remember, there's always going to be someone out there who is or has been worse off than you and be grateful for 3 unlimited meals a day and your top notch education and designer clothes."

It is so hard to happy when you have roommate if you're an introvert. I feel like I have no time to myself because he is always there. It's really making me upset and driving me insane. Just having another person present in the room bothers me. I don't like him only because he never leaves the room which I know is not a legitimate reason to dislike someone. What makes it worse is that I got stuck with a random roommate again. I guess my luck is just that bad."

I've been at Cornell for 5 semesters practically, and I've never looked forward to doing any of my assignments that I would somehow bomb. I've been in and out of depression feeling weak because no matter what I do, I just fuck up. I can't afford to transfer to another school because I'm too poor and can't handle being in debt.

However... For the first time, I felt excited about a project in one of my math classes and all I do now is talk and think about it. This could be a turning point for me here at Cornell. 

Moral of the story: if you're struggling to find yourself here at Cornell, it takes time. You just gotta keep moving forward no matter how weak you feel. Things will unravel by themselves. Stay strong Cornell, stay strong."

Why do college students have to drink so much?  It can really be a lot of fun to just have a couple drinks in one night but many of my ""friends"" feel the need to go overboard every weekend.

I know this is old, cliched, hippie, etc. or whatever, but it doesn't make it untrue. I really think it's absolutely abhorrent that we commit the equivalent of by far the largest genocide in history every day on innocent animals. At that, quite evolved mammals. Pigs are actually one of the most intelligent species in the world, up there with dogs. They have emotions, they reason, they have self-awareness. I am a complete hypocrite because I eat meat, and the reason we do it is because the vast majority of humans do as well. If we didn't though, and hadn't all grown up accepting it - think about how disgusting we would find the thought of it. You can go to jail for animal molestation, yet killing millions every day is okay. It's just a bit ridiculous is all, in the most terrible sense. On top of it all, nowadays animals are tortured, forced to live in their own waste, chained their whole lives in minimal space and shot up with insane drugs. I'm not a hippie, I'm actually quite a moderate Democrat, on a lot of issues conservative, but this is outside of political views. People used to think that slavery was acceptable, not because they thought it was okay to treat people inhumanely, but because they unconditionally believed that free labor was indispensable to their way of life. I think the mass killing of animals is an analogous situation. Not anything like it, not comparable, but analogous in how it's justified. I hate the fact we have to do it."

I doubt that some ""experts"" claiming to help people with their research never had real sympathy on who they're going to help out, just doing for their own honors. Some doing cool stuff to ""improve health/behavior/performance"" may never had experience on how physical/mental health problems destroy life. And those who are struggling never had a chance to get involved in these projects, or even being ignored directly by the elites, passing by on campus. Yes, opportunities  need ABILITY, not will. But the world is still cruel. Some people are suffering not because of their own fault, but they have to afford it themselves."

The grade deflation Cornell students experience — relative to peer institutions — is a huge hurdle to our future success. I left a traditional ""STEM"" major, not because of the incredibly demanding work of the classes, not because of the terrible instruction, not because of the disorganized advising, and not because of the very structured major requirements which would have severely limited my ability to explore different academic subjects (one of the main reasons that I came to the College of Arts and Sciences in the first place), but because of Cornell's relative grade deflation; the grades that my friends and I have received are all too often not reflective of the work that we have done in these incredibly demanding classes. I understand that the Administration at Cornell wants to avoid the grade inflation at peer institutions (the median and most frequent grade at Harvard is an A, over 50% of grades at Brown are A's, 62% of grades at Yale are A’s, etc.). Showing median grades on transcripts was a good first step, but admissions officers don't differentiate between absolute and relative grades when comparing grad school applicants (see ""Inflated Applicants: Attribution Errors in Performance Evaluation by Professionals,"" Swift, et. all.). The grading system needs to be reevaluated if the Administration doesn't want to hinder Cornell students pursuing internships, jobs or admission to graduate school."

Anyone that knows me will know I'm the one to write these posts, but it was eating me up inside. Thank you all for liking the post and for the comments. I've tried to talk to people about this but ""sexual assault"" just shuts people up.

It's even harder being brushed off by the first 30 people I tried talking to about it."

I've just spent this charter weekend studying for a final on Tuesday. My professor is holding class on Monday morning so I don't have extra time like I assumed I would have. I don't mind though. There is absolutely nothing to celebrate about this place. I fucking hate it here. After North Korea, Cornell is the worst place on the planet. I can't wait until I get that degree and I can leave this place forever. I wish that I make so much money that when Cornell asks me for a donation I can give them a giant fuck you. I would bring a giant pile of cash and burn on the Engineering quad or Arts quad (doesn't really matter to me). But the point is that would be the ultimate fuck you. Like I have an absurd amount of money to donate but would rather burn this money than give it to you Cornell. If I ever become famous, I would always rip on Cornell. Just destroy its reputation. This is all of course a fantasy and would never happen but I wish it would. This only describes a fraction of my hatred of this place. I don't think I've hated anything this much before. I think I'm certifiably insane."

I tried going to doctors, and dentists and no one can even help me with it since they can't tell the cause. My teeth are healthy, since I always brush them and I never had a cavity even. I am confused. Today when someone told me to my face that I am a loser because of it and that I will never find a gf because of it, it hit me as if I walked into a wall. I just wanted to cry but I had class almost all day. When I came home to my dorm I just let it out. Luckily, I can just stay inside for today, cry, and  eat what I have in my room because I have nothing else to do besides homework, and because I am ashamed. There is nothing I could probably do I am such a loser, no matter what I try to eat and to use breath mints, good toothpaste and mouthwash."

I am an international student currently on a full scholarship at Cornell.  I started freshman year full of vigor and determination to do well and make my country, school and especially my family proud. Being a first generation student, the pressure on me is immense even though my family tries hard not to show. Freshman year went by in a bliss even though my spring semester suffered from incertitude on what career path to take. Sophomore fall I decided to switch to the pre-med track. That semester was a rude awakening. I got a warning concerning my grades but managed to pick myself up this whole semester. Now that the semester is about to end, I am constantly afraid I will do badly in one or two of my classes and be told to go on a leave of absence. I party and have fun but first and foremost work hard and try my best to keep up with work. Deep down I know my hard work will pay off but the fear of failure and being asked to take a leave of absence keeps nagging me. I'm not sure this is the best platform to let all this out but I really feel less scared as I type these words."

This is my beautiful country and I love it! I love the Constitution, the military, the police, the nuclear family, and America's most efficient manufacturing and energy production workforce. The US is finally becoming the number one oil and gas producer in the world. I buy only American-made products that go to supporting Americans working and keeping money in our country making it stronger by helping our economy. I also donate money to various wounded warrior organizations and police benevolent organizations. Did you know that America is once again respected in the world? The US Passport allows one to travel freely without a visa or instant visa upon arrival, more than any other passport in the world? I feel this campus is so unpatriotic as most students have resentment towards America and it's great institutions, even though Cornell was founded as a land-grant institution with the goal of supporting academic freedom and also training military leaders for the future.

I'm worried that something must have happened to you in order to have caused this change, but I don't feel like I know you well enough to ask. Now, whenever I speak to you I'm reminded of that and I get a little sad. I know that you read Cornell Confessions sometimes, but I doubt that you'll know who I am even if you did read this.

 I came in as a sophomore transfer and I knew it would be hard for me to make friends because of my shy disposition. I thought by the end of the year I might find my place or at least make a friend or two but I still haven't made any social progress at all.. What most frustrating is that I think I fell in love with someone on the first day of classes and I'm afraid of trying to talk even though the few times we have it has always been so very pleasant. I can't stand it, you have the most wonderful blue-green aura, a beautiful voice and the kindest disposition. I know if I just tried to reach out to you that we could be friends but I think I would just fall for you even more and I doubt that you'd ever see me that way especially when it feels as though people see me as an empty shell.

What is it about the basics of being human that make you not want to be around us? Yes I'm talking about YOU the reader! We, the social misfits and awkward, did not choose to be this way or at the very least I know I didn't. Circumstances from infancy did not prepare me well for the life I face today. For a good part of my life I have been avoiding people not because I don't like them, but because I don't have a clue how to interact and form healthy friendships and such. And I know you happy people have this BS thing about 'oh you've got to put yourself out there, and keep trying blah blah blah'. You have no idea how much I've been trying. But the more I try, the more people treat me like I'm a thing from a different world that they know nothing about. I always try to stay positive, and try to troubleshoot: What am I doing differently that is not working? Am I just too ugly? I'm I an automatic turnoff to people? For over two decades of my life humans have shit on me and I get no love from anyone whatsoever. People are even disgusted when they have to pair up with me in class for a group work/project. Now I'm fed up. I contemplated suicide but I don't want to go that way. Now I don't care about anyone, because no one did me. I did you no wrong, people. Why do you so resent me. You're creating a demon out of me, and when I'm fully groomed, I'll feed off of the evil the world has to offer.

To the almost man,
We texted for an entire summer, and fall for each other as much as you possibly can that way. You told me that I'm special, that I'm the first one you'd want to be with for a long time, that I'm impossible to believe. I understood that a fair amount of that is exaggeration, and in the fall when we stopped talking and we both met new people, I was really ok about it. More months go by. In a moment of weakness, I hooked up with you after you messaged me out of the blue, and I just wanted it to be that - a hook up. Months go by and then you want to see me again? Everything about you and all of your friends tell me that you tell romantic lies to every girl you want to hook up with, so why do you keep coming back after so many months each time? Why do I matter so much to you? Did you run out of girls? Did I actually mean something to you?
Very curious,
Your almost woman"

You looked astoundingly gorgeous (as usual), while I looked like utter shit. 

I feel incapable of striking a friendship with you because I rarely come across you, both in and out of campus, however I have been conquered by your beauty.

I wish I could tell you this in person, but I am afraid you would run away. After all, I would seem to pushy on you and I don't want to give you more thing to worry about.

You beautiful, keep being who you are and what makes you YOU because that is the main reason why you are so attractive for me, and why I am falling for you."

To the ""other woman"", it has been incredibly difficult but I am in the middle of patching up my relationship. Its going as well as it can be. You apologized to me, so I am apologizing to you in advance for when I fuck your shit up. :) Its the least I can do."

I may not always get along with my family members, but recently, my heart is breaking for them. My mom called me and asked me to vote every day this week for a chance to makeover our bathroom. For the past ten years, it has been my experience that once something in our house breaks beyond a simple repair, it stays broken. Our house was built with 2 bathrooms: one upstairs, one downstairs. Ever since I can remember, the downstairs shower has not been functional. In the past few years, the downstairs toilet broke and it was removed from the bathroom without replacement. That bathroom is only really useful for washing hands. Recently, it has become clear that the upstairs shower is falling apart, and there are some serious issues with the plumbing.

When I visited for winter break, I was standing in the kitchen and noticed a trickle of water leaving one of the cabinets IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE UPSTAIRS TOILET WAS FLUSHED. Apparently, the same thing happens when someone takes a shower. I was so disgusted by the condition that my home was in the last time that I visited, that I packed up and spent the rest of my time at my sister’s apartment. I am honestly scared that the first floor ceiling of my family’s house will one day cave in.

When I was in high school, I started to notice that things were getting progressively worse. When our washer and dryer broke, my mom started going to the laundromat because they were too expensive to fix or replace. No one was ever invited over to our home because it just wasn’t a welcoming environment.

I am a recent Cornell graduate, and am currently attending grad school in public health. I think that everyone deserves to live with a certain amount of dignity, and I plan to spend my career ensuring that all people have access to healthy living conditions, but seeing as I am still in grad school with multiple loans to pay off, I’m afraid I will be too late to help my own family. To some extent, my parents are responsible for the house that they live in, but my little brother, who is still in high school, deserves a better chance. 

The home makeover contest is hosted by the radio station 100.7 WHUD. If you go to their website, then click “home makeover,” then “Click here to vote,” and then search on “loosening,” that’s my mom’s entry. It only has 8 votes right now because my mom is too embarrassed to tell anyone but me and my sister. The 3 of us have been voting each day since it started on Monday (April 20th). We have until midnight on Sunday (April 26th) to vote, and each person can vote once each day.  None of the entries have broken 200 votes yet. If even a fraction of the people who check this page daily decide to vote for my mom’s entry, she could easily win $4500, and I cannot even describe how grateful she would be. Voters have to create an account to login, but it takes less than 1 minute. Also, you have to be from NY, NJ, or CT. But knowing the make-up of the Cornell student body, that shouldn’t hurt our numbers too much.

I met some of the most inspirational and compassionate people during my time at Cornell, and I know that together, we can make a difference. If my mom wins this contest, I will take it upon myself to ensure that the money is used in the most sensible way possible. For example, it might be most economical to vacate the upstairs bathroom, and fix the downstairs one. Please pass this information on to your NY, NJ, and CT friends. Thank you!"

It blew up in my face, as predicted. And while I am glad I was able to be myself for a while, I feel like I once again have to put on this facade for guys, then slowly peel it away.

As I sit in my bed and see friends in relationships or hear about friends starting relationships, I wonder if It's ever going to happen to me. I've had flings in the past, but I've always overthought stuff to the point where it didn't work out. Call me old-fashioned and romantic (I hope), but I'm the kind of guy who gradually starts liking a girl because I want to get to know them first. I might just be really bad about timing, but sometimes I truly wonder if I will truly find the one. Or maybe I will just die alone."

We are close friends, and I hooked up with you a few times in the fall, despite the fact that you have a girlfriend. I thought you were going to leave her for me. You didn't, and still being your friend gets really hard because I'm so in love with you, and I'm not sure you know."

So a lot is made/said of the fact that once you're here you're no longer the smartest person in your area, and adjusting/coping with that, esp. since so many of you were top people in your class/school/etc. But I for one love that about this place, the fact that I can be defined for my actual personality rather than just stereotyped as a nerd or something else just cause of my grades. I can try my best with the assurance that I won't be labelled for it and in that label-less void I can choose what I want to be labelled and known as, and be able to embrace and laugh at the fact that frankly, I'm an idiot around here. Yeah, it's an insecure feeling, and it sucks with the pressure of classes and whatnot to feel inferior or less smart than others, but take some time to really think about what a great opportunity it is, we're all here cause we're smart and chances are before Cornell and once we go out in the real world with the Cornell label we'll never have much of a chance to shape our own label. But for 4 years over here we can escape that and truly find our personality, and that, frankly, is just amazing, and is probably the biggest reason I love this beautiful place"

I found that I like freedom. The freedom to do things when I want without stress. So, I decided that I wanted independence. I am going to save money for 10-15 years after graduating and then retire. I don't have crippling student loans so my time frame could be smaller. I want to get up in the morning and drink tea while reading for two hours. I want to leave the country because I'm bored. I want to do whatever whenever I want. I want the power to say ""fuck you"" to anyone who makes me work. If that means living like a college student, so be it. This has also made me more focused on my studies because I have to get a high paying job. My dreams drive me and I know they are only 10-15 years away. Everything else is insignificant. Since then, my life has been a blur. I let go of things that truly do not matter. I'm so focused on my goal that nothing can stop me. It's a high like no other. You might be wondering if I might get bored. I mean a 35 year old guy with no job. What are you going to do? The beauty of it is: I don't know. Maybe I'll learn an instrument or live in another country. I might become a part time community college teacher. But the point is, those are all things I want to do. Totally up to me what I want to do with my time. Not work 40-60 hrs a week as an engineer, be stressed, or have kids. Sorry, I haven't told anyone this and I don't plan on it. I am overflowing with excitement. I had to let it out somehow. And who am I? That's one secret I'll never tell. xoxo g.g."

I have a relatively good life. I am doing okay in school. I have great friends and a caring family that I feel so blessed to have. But often I walk alone around campus and collegetown late at night and just reflect on my life both at home and here at Cornell. I pass places on campus that hold memories- some good and some bad. No matter how good my life is at the moment, whenever I take these walks I can't help but yearn to run away and never stop running, and somehow fade into the darkness leaving everything, everyone, and my entire identity behind me."

Depression is humiliating.

It turns intelligent, kind people into zombies who can’t wash a dish or change their socks. It affects the ability to think clearly, to feel anything, to ascribe value to your lifelong passions, your relative good fortune. It scoops out your normal healthy ability to cope with bad days and bad news, and replaces it with an unrecognizable sludge that finds no pleasure, no delight, no point in anything.

You alienate your friends because you can’t comfort yourself socially, you struggle with school because you can’t concentrate, you live in moderate squalor because you have no energy to stand up, let alone take out the garbage. You become pathetic and you know it. And you have no capacity to stop the downward plunge. You have no perspective, no emotional reserves, no faith that it will get better. So you feel guilty and ashamed of your inability to deal with life like a regular human, which exacerbates the depression and the isolation.

If you’ve never been depressed, thank your lucky stars and back off the folks who take a pill so they can make eye contact with the grocery store cashier. No one on earth would choose the nightmare of depression over an averagely turbulent normal life. It’s not an incapacity to cope with day to day living in the modern world. It’s an incapacity to function. At all.

No one chooses it. No one deserves it. It runs in families, it ruins families. You cannot imagine what it takes to feign normalcy, to show up to work, to make a doctors appointment, to pay bills, to walk your dog, to return library books on time, to keep enough toilet paper on hand, when you are exerting most of your capacity on trying to stay afloat.

Depression is real. Compassion is also real. And a depressed person may cling desperately to it until they are out of the woods and they may remember your compassion for the rest of their lives as a force greater than their depression.

Have a heart."

No matter what you're studying here, it takes an immense amount of bravery to study at Cornell, a school known for working students to the bone and rubbing salt into the wound with its stinging winds and subzero temperatures.

I always thought that people were more divided along class lines than anything else, but my experience here at Cornell has made me realize just how right I was. I rarely have any trouble relating to working and middle class students from other ethnic and religious backgrounds, but some of the wealthy students here seem like they grew up on a different planet with some of the things they think and say."

I considered you a really good friend and you treated me like shit. It hurts to realize that you never considered me an important part of your life like I thought. You hurt me without a care about my feelings, you used me to make yourself feel better, and you sold me out for your own gain. I thought we were friends but you only care about yourself. I hope you realize your mistake someday but you're so fucking narcissistic that you'll probably keep on thinking you're God. I hope you're happy, but I really doubt you are."

I watched the Hindi movie 3 Idiots a long time ago, and it's a pretty good movie about friends who meet by struggling together at a top engineering college in India. Anyways, I'm not usually emotional when watching movies, and I wasn't the first time I watched this one. But I started watching it again today, and suddenly all the shit that the characters experience at college resonated with me so much; in the beginning, a student commits suicide because he can't complete a project in order to be able to graduate on time, and while I'm not suicidal, I often feel like I'm up against a wall. It's like I'm constantly putting my 110% into running a race I know I'll never win, and the pressure to try harder and take on more responsibility and still be happy is way too much. And there's nothing I can do to take the pressure away. 

So yeah. I didn't think fiction would make me cry, but I guess because of where I am in life right now, this movie fucking destroyed me."

I'm really really sorry I've been so callous toward you all this time.  I really like you, both as a friend and more, if you'd want to go there.  It's just that I'm also really intimidated by you, for obvious reasons.  You probably don't see any reason for my feeling that way, considering you talk to me in the first place, but I still do.  The only way I feel I can keep up with you is by pretending I don't have any feelings for you and I don't really care.  But I do.  It's just hard to show it, since I'm afraid you might find it amusing that someone like me would even try for someone like you.  That's why I act like such a bro whenever I'm around you, instead of the caring, understanding, and loving friend I'd really rather be."

I always tell my friend that I am middle class and that my family is doing okay but if my friend knew how wealthy I was I don't know if they would want to hang around me. I don't know what to do but its eating me up living a lie inside as my parents get me anything I want and my friend always wonders where I get the money from. My parents set up an investment plan for my future so I may never have to work a day in my life and I don't want my friend to find out. I don't want to hurt anyone's feelings and I want to help my friend but they never want anything from me even though I assume they may be in a less fortunate situation based on the complaints I hear.

I wish to say that I really like him. Literally we are friends and  we have been taken some classes together, interacting with each other on Facebook and other SNSs, and we sometimes hang out with other friends together. I realized that for a long time I've been trying to avoid eye contact with him, and I dare not even stare at his photos for more than 2 sec. A brief encounter with him on campus makes my whole day, and a short dialogue with him turns my whole week upside down. Yet I'm always so nervous when there is a chance of meeting him. I hesitate on telling him about this, because I don't want to risk my friendship with him. Both of us are graduating and I wish I could make some changes, or at the very least ask him out just to consolidate friendship. But I really hate myself being too scared to do any of these."

Now that I am no longer under your spell, I am so happy that we are not together anymore. When you left me I thought it was the worst thing to ever happen to me, but I recently realized that it was probably the best thing for me. Our relationship was bringing me down and bringing me pain. Now I am as confident as ever and very excited about my future. It's so strange but I feel nothing for you when I see you. I don't care if we never speak again. I don't care if you start dating someone else. I see you for who you are now, and that's why I'm able to move on. I know that you will regret leaving me. You probably do already. But I'm happy to say that I don't need you or want you anymore."

I am really torn about whether we should break up or not. I really like you and was thinking I loved you before all this went down. I know deep down inside I can do better but it's hard for me to let go. At the same time, I don't want to be stuck in a relationship for an extended period of time where I'm not appreciated. Let's face it  things are not really going to be different At our core we are who we are. There is so much good about you and so many awful things as well. I have really never felt so torn. If I stay I close myself off from someone who could possibly make me much happier. If I break up with you then I might come to regret it especially since I remember how much dating before you came along sucked. Most of the guys I dated were jerks and you are not a jerk, but is that enough to stay? You're not a jerk, you just don't put in any effort."

During the time that she was in hospital my grandparents and my uncle passed away. My life really sucked. Every morning that I woke up I wished the day would finish sooner so that I could again go to sleep and forget about my painful problems. After those sad years my gf is stable again and my life looks balanced now. I can enjoy the sunshine again and laugh to the people around me. I have started to have a pleasant time in my life. I know that there is no way to escape the bad events in any life, but I hope at least the serial events of bad things in life had a 'pause' button, I could press that button and enjoy my current life a little more before the next bad thing..."

Response to #5600:

I thought that it was possible this could be about me, and so I figured I'd respond because it's true, I don't know to respond to your text messages or apologies. Look, you're a great guy and we had a really interesting conversation before I left for break - but you asking me whether I was going on the bus alone, pressuring me for more personal information, asking questions that I really did not feel comfortable AT ALL answering. All this the day after I met you, when we had one conversation over dinner. You asked me for my phone number because my phone was out on the table; I couldn't be rude and NOT give you my number, so I did but I felt very uncomfortable doing so.

Your constant, personal questions honestly freaked me out and I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings by not responding, but I don't think it was fair of you to ask me those questions or to expect me to provide personal information immediately after I met you. I still don't know how to respond because while I do want to tell you 'Please stop texting me, you're making me incredibly uncomfortable and I don't like this situation', I didn't want to hurt your feelings. I hope this clarifies things...I know that your intentions are good because you want to be friends, but I'm very uncomfortable and would rather not text you back & re-open that conversation."

Men move mountains to be with the one they love. You're a coward. You're heartless and immature. I was always trying to figure out if it hurt more to be with you or if it would hurt more to be without you. I was so stuck and you made no effort to make things better. I had genuine love and respect for you. You aren't perfect but that's partially why I loved you. I realized that you abandoning me was the best thing you've done for me in a long time. I always felt alone when I was with you so nothing changes for me now that you're gone. Please don't do what you did to me, to anyone else. Often times I'd rather suffer physical pain instead of the constant emotional pain you subjected me to. I hope the memories we created together torture you for the rest of your life. You will never find someone who will put you first and themselves second like I did. I hope you live in regret. I hope it eats you alive inside."

I'm sorry for spending too much time in the lab and not listening to your problems with me and making amends. You know I am trying to be the best I can because you know my friend died back in middle school, and I'm trying to honor him by maximizing my productivity in terms of trying to bring change to the world. I told you when we first met during the first week of freshman year that I'm gonna try and be the best and push myself  to the furthest extent that I couldn't even imagine. I told you that if I ever deviated from that goal, I needed you to tell me to get back on track and continue pushing until my friend's death was fully honored. 

However, I failed to listen to your problems with me and our friendship had soured because of my selfishness to do lab work and not balancing that life with your own. I'm sorry I had put you second. I'm sorry that you were pushed away. I'm sorry even for the fact that you met me because you had a protected childhood, and it's not right for me to expect you to fully understand my feelings and perspectives. And I'm sorry for ""making you push your friends away"" after you and your friends made fun of me. And I forgave you soon after your insensitive behaviors too. Like, I enjoy talking to you and don't hold your ignorance against you as I believe you will learn. There is just a communication gap between us, and ignoring the problem won't help. I had tried to hit the reset button several times, but you just ended up crying anyways. And I know you tried to explain to me what your problems were, but I still don't understand. But I WANT to understand them. So, why can't we make tangible changes and reconcile for the better?

Or should I just do what you and everyone else told me to do and move on? I'm still not over my friend's death, so how can you expect me to move on past your leave of absence? I mean, moving on feels like betraying a conviction. If I have a feeling, I follow it 110%, and my feeling is that you are someone I care about and want to be involved in your life because I can never forget the boldness of your laugh. When you laugh with your friends without me, I smile so much, and have a slight ache that I'm not the one who can make you laugh. Well, you never found me funny anyways. Maybe it is all for the better. Point is, I'm sticking to my conviction for you as that is what makes me genuinely, deeply happy. Whatever you choose that makes you genuinely, deeply happy will make me genuinely and deeply happy. But I'm still sticking to that conviction."

I'm so miserable here and I treat everyone like shit. I hate myself for doing it but I just can't help it sometimes. I hate everything about this place and it brings out the worst in me. I even treat my friends like shit, I associate them with this place and even though they aren't the greatest friends, they don't deserve to be treated like this. I can't wait for the day I can leave everything associated with Cornell behind."

I would've given you a second chance after you screwed everything up, but you never texted me again. And then I saw you twice in two days and you didn't acknowledge me, even though I saw you looking at me. I had a really good time with you but apparently you only wanted me for sex. 

I want to believe myself when I say I'm over it but it hurts me that I believed every nice thing you said to me when apparently none of it was true."

Don't give up. Try talking to her. Even if this semester is almost over there's always next semester. And if this is your last semester here I would still go for it if you feel she's special. I'm telling you this but really I should be taking my own advise. There's this guy that I like and the truth is he's probably going to leave without ever knowing how I feel about him because I'm too shy and too afraid to say anything to him. So be brave. Don't be like me."

I just transferred in and am so incredibly happy to be here. I was so unhappy and depressed at my old school and even on the rough days, I can say with 100% truth that even though this school is so so so difficult for me, there is no place else I would rather be struggling."
2424,2015-04-21 23:57:53,"5625
I don't know how to say this to you without sounding creepy but I really like you. Don't let me go. I feed off of your life force. You keep me going. I'll do anything to keep you smiling. We've only been dating for a little less than 6 months so this may be sudden and I really don't want to scare you away. I'm a guy who normally hides his feelings but you make it nearly impossible to do so. Thanks for everything. You're the best thing that has ever happened to me."

We met the first day of Freshman year. I was attracted to you the minute we met (yes I know it sounds cliché). I was excited when I learned we would be in the same major, and have similar classes. After getting to know you over two years, I was ready to make my move but you were already in a happy relationship with someone else. Not asking you out sooner is probably my only regret from my time at Cornell. As we prepare to graduate, I know that we will go our separate ways but hope that we will stay in touch. If you are ever single, I would be interested to see if there could be something between us."

Whenever I look out the window from the library, I see couples cuddling up on the slope and doing cute couple-y things together. At first, I get really sad, then I say to myself that one day that's going to be me, then I turn around and start memorizing orgo reactions again."
2427,2015-04-21 23:54:57,"5622
I feel like you and I click.  I've only spoken to you a couple times, but the last time I really realized how kind you are.  I had a nice time talking to you at the highlighter party, even though it was just a little."
2428,2015-04-21 23:35:59,"5621
I love you so much, and you're so good to me. The problem is, I'm such an awful bitch to you. I know where I get it from, but I can't blame my upbringing; I'm an adult, I take responsibility for my actions. It's just something I do without thinking now, constantly lashing out at you about the smallest things just because I'm stressed. We're all stressed at Cornell, though, and that doesn't give us the right to be horrible to each other. It's funny, people think of me as such a sweetheart - I used to think of myself as such a sweetheart before I got comfortable in this beautiful, wonderful relationship we have. I hope I find a way to curb my awful temper before I destroy everything."

I'm in my early 20s and still a virgin.  If I wanted to, I could get a guy and just get it done with, I know I could.  But I don't want to do it like that!  I want to share that moment with someone I really like and who really likes me.  Someone I care about!  Is there something wrong with that?  I don't go around shouting ""I'm a virgin,"" but it comes up in conversations sometimes (very rarely - like with friends or family, sometimes) and I'm made to feel like I'm weird because I'm ""so old."""

I'm a prospective freshman and I visited Cornell expecting to commit right away. Instead, I felt left out and concerned. I didn't click with anyone all weekend and I feel like I'm not ""long islandy"" enough for this school. I thought people here would be liberal (I am very much so) but this is the first place I've heard people use ""fag"" as an insult in over four years and I'm still hearing people say that social issues don't matter. 
My biggest issue though was people downing on the school. I came in ready to say every other school sucks and that Cornell was the best, but people I met seem more resigned to being here than thrilled. I was told to go to Duke instead of here and it seems like everyone sort of thinks of Cornell as a fallback school even though it's an incredible place.
Also it's freezing."

This weekend I visited an old friend at another college. The second I set foot there, people greeted me, asked what my name was and all about me since they'd never seen me. I felt incredibly welcomed, and like I'd gone there for years. No talk of school work, or anything stressful for that matter. I was instantly part of a family. Pure and absolute bliss. 
I mention this story because it is a stark contrast to the experiences I've had at Cornell. There's a prevalent sense of unhappiness and discontent that fills the air. Every person I've told here that I go to Cornell responds the same way. It's primarily labeled as a depressing, miserable place to be despite its high academic caliber.

I don't think Cornell is a family. It doesn't even feel like a community. I feel like I couldn't even sit at a table with someone without them wanting me to go away. It feels like an overcrowded fish bowl where the fish just sliver past each other in a robotic and emotionless way. Any remote sense of community is just superficial, and its practically like everyone at Cornell left their emotions and happiness in some other place. 

Its an absolute dystopia, and too many people are unwilling to admit it."

I've had a few women tell me recently they found me cute (and presumably wanted to date me). I do like them in theory and I do want a heterosexual relationship, but am a cross between homosexual and asexual. I get horny thinking about men receiving blowjobs (not usually me giving them), or me receiving them (from any sex), but when if it ever came down to it, I don't think I could ever have sex (and if I did, I could only imagine it being vaginal). I don't think this should be a big deal, but I've only started thinking about these conflicts while at college, and it seems that it's required for someone to be sexually attracted to another to be together. Ugh."

STUDENTS IN THE DORMS HAVE TO LEARN THE WORD """"""""""""""""""""RESPECT""""""""""""""""""""

So here I am to complain about my floormates. I have all my pans and pots in cabinets (as mostly everyone does) and I don't really mind people using my pans as long as they put it back as it was and CLEAN. However, I don't see this. It turns out that people use my pans and LEAVE IT IN THE SINK FOR TWO STRAIGHT DAYS. Not only that; my soap was inside one of the pans and the person uses it and LEAVES IT OUTSIDE. so let's say I don't have soap anymore.

Anyway, I am just tired of people not respecting others' belongings. IF YOU USE PEOPLE'S STUFF, PUT IT BACK AS IT WAS.

MOST IMPORTANTLY, DONT EAT PEOPLE'S FOOD. You don't know the sacrifice people make to get their food as Cornell is very expensive and many students can barely afford it. There is a reason why we cook; WE WANT TO SAVE MONEY OR MAYBE WE CANT AFFORD DINING OUTSIDE. So, please don't eat people's food because you don't know if they rely on them for the following days.

OK IM DONE."

I only go around saying that I hate Cornell because it is far easier than """"I hate me.""""  I hate this fucking life I've made for myself.  I hate the fact that I have spent essentially every weekend alone for the past six years.  I hate that I can have a week of extreme optimism and motivation, where I can forget my troubles, my fears, my lies and feel like I can take on the whole world myself, yet subsequently descend into an extreme depression for MONTHS on end.  I hate the fact that, despite being here two years, I only have two ""friends"" here.  That is, I know two people who occasionally have lunch with me.  And even when one of these two miraculously asks me to hang out, I can't respond because I HAVE NO FUCKING CLUE WHAT HANGING OUT EVEN MEANS.  I haven't had real friends for a long, long time.  What do people even do when they are together?  I don't drink, I'm horrified of large groups.  I have no interest in talking about fucking relationships or grades.  Fuck, I just want people with whom I can get really excited about the new Star Wars trailer.  Or people I can have deep talks with about science fiction novels we've read.  Or people to watch the sunset with and talk on idle things.  
      Fuck.  Who am I kidding.  I don't idle on much these days.  What little reading I do is a sad reflection of the avid consumption of literature of my pre-this-shit years.  I don't have much in the way of passions or interests.  I'm just a sad shadow of who I once was, caught in depression and not really sure why I get out of bed in the morning.  If I could find a painless way to end it, I would.   Perhaps I'll find it someday. Gotta keep looking."

I'm anxious about a lot of things in my life, but dying alone is right at the top. It's honestly pathetic that I'm so caught up in finding someone, but if no ones ever wanted me before why would they now or ever? My friends say it's because I can come off as intimidating but I'm about as sensitive and emotional as it could get. I've even worked up the nerve to tell the boys I had crushes on that I liked them. Maybe people can just somehow sense the crippling insecurity underneath. Maybe I'm not emotionally ready for a relationship but if that's the case I'm not sure if I ever will be. I'm not looking for someone to ""fix"" me. I'm aware that only I can do that. But it'd be nice to have someone for support and to support in return. I want my first kiss and date with a boy who makes my face flush. I want someone to inspire me to do better and be better and I want to be someone's inspiration. I want to trace constellations on someone's skin and see the galaxies swirling in their eyes. I want them to tell me about their past and I want to kiss their wounds. I want blanket forts, late night marathons and sweet kisses that take my breath away. I want playful bickering, teasing and sarcasm. I want to keep saying ""my boyfriend"" until my friends and family go from fond exasperation to being flat out annoyed. I want someone to tell me that they love me, and I want to believe them. 

Maybe I just wouldn't be a good enough girlfriend."

I have a good life. But people can be so mean. I am good at showing I don't care, but it is seriously damaging. A lot lately I've been thinking that it would be better if I wasn't here. I wouldn't have to worry about things anymore. People's opinions of me or not liking me wouldn't matter. Not having to worry about what job I will have when I graduate or finding someone to spend my life with. Just all the things that I worry about for the future would disappear... and I wouldn't have to think about it so much... that would be nice. 

It's not even that I'm morbid.. I am very happy. I just don't see the benefit in staying. The only thing that is keeping me here is my mom. She is my everything and I love her too much to do that to her. So yeah.. not really a point to this. I don't need ""I'm here if you need to talk to me"" or ""it will all be okay"" responses. I just needed to share what was on my mind. And my mom isn't dying anytime soon. so don't worry about me."

Anyone looking at me would see a passionate, driven individual and a strong community leader. No one sees how lonely and tired I am since I can flawlessly mask how I feel. 

Despite my stength, the loneliness is starting to eat away at me slowly. I'm tired of coming home to an empty, alarmingly quiet apartment. I long for intimacy. I want to intricately explore the depths of someone's mind and body and find someone who wishes to do the same. Most aspects of my life are incredibly fulfilling but this emptiness in my heart just seems to grow day after day and there's nothing I can do about it except wait for someone worthwhile to come along and see if we connect."

I've been in a long distance relationship for about a year now. It seems this year has been one crazy roller coaster ride of emotions for me. We've had plenty of ups and downs, but after one year, we are still pulling through. However, it definitely has not been an easy journey for the both of us. Because of finances, especially for him, we cannot afford to see each other as much as other couples do. While couples sometimes can meet some weekends, go on fancy dates, plan exciting things to do together, for us, because of distance and money, we can only afford to see each other once every couple months if we are lucky. Especially for him, it is very hard to come visit me here because he works full time, pays his own tuition, will soon pay for his own housing, and he can barely afford all of this on his own. Therefore, the few times we do get to spend together are so special for both of us, and we make the most of the little time we can be with each other. On top of that, there's also this issue of his low self esteem, and low motivation to finish school. He is having a lot of trouble getting through college because he doesn't have the confidence to get through because of past depression issues. He told me recently that if he had not met me, he would have dropped out of college already and would be spending his life working many jobs to support himself. But because of me, he is trying to motivate himself to finish school, and make something of himself, which I am truly humble and moved by.
Upon hearing our situation, which I'll admit is very difficult for me, some people would tell me to move on, the long distance is hard, it probably won't go anywhere, you're hurting yourself, he's not worth this emotional heartbreak, you're young you can meet so many people here who can love you etc. Yes, it's true there are so many wonderful men here I have the opportunity of meeting without dealing with the heartbreak of long distance, but truth is, I will not give up on him even with the difficulties we face. I'll always love him even if he can't afford to see me often, even if it takes him many years to finish school and get his degree, even if we can't go on fancy dates like other couples can do. Through all his imperfections and struggles, I'll always be there for him and care about him, just like I know he is to me. We don't choose to be in any relationship for the sake  of saying you are in one. We choose to be in one because of the deep trust, love, and compassion that both people feel for one another, no matter the circumstance. For me, I fell in love with someone who unfortunately lives in another city. Even through the tears of missing him, this journey and experience is something I won't regret, because I'm experiencing this with him, and together, there's no other place I'd rather be in."

I was going to post something attempting to add constructive input to the constant bickering about racism n shit, but after typing something out I said fuck it.  I'm just gonna go chill with my Haitian, Domican, Indian, and Arab buddies.  Motherfucking racial rainbow up in here.  

But seriously, just chill out a little bit.  Change won't happen tomorrow, and as long as you believe in accepting others for who they are, and confront your own inner biases, than you are helping us move things in the right direction.  

Equality is subjective.  It means something different to everyone, but I propose that you just believe in love. That you believe in brotherhood and sisterhood.  In supporting your neighbor.  After all we are all on this struggle bus together.

I am really scared to drive.

I haven't driven much in the past especially when I'm I was in college for the past 4 years. Now I have to drive to my job and I don't know what to do as I cannot rely on anyone or public transportation. Is anyone else scared or anxious to drive or is it only me?

There's no such thing as a ""wrong"" message. Every decision in its on way is the right decision. Take a chance, use the moment, and go with your gut.

If you are who I think you are, please know that I feel the same way and I've been missing having you as a close friend. I may also have fucked us up last semester but I sense that the wave between our minds can foster such a rich friendship.

I'm not happy at this place, even though I receive good grades and get great internships. I always think an important point of attending a top school is to realize you are not the best person in world, and to learn to be humble and work harder. Apparently some Cornellians on this campus don't think so. They appear to be conceited, as if they are the greatest people, have everything they want, and are capable of doing anything. They appear to be privileged and deserve it so much. I'm sorry but I have to say they are truly disgusting, native, high school-minded. I'm disappointed that I have to go to school and live with these childish people, which bothers me so much. I can't wait to get out of here in one year."

I feel bad for my friend since she struggled at Cornell in the past. I hope this semester she will rebound and really enjoy her time here. I know my time here was tough at times, but I can say now that I wish I can experience everything again. The real world is not that great. The key to really being happy here is to enjoy whatever you can. I didn't really think of it much until my last two years at Cornell, when I started to become really proactive all over campus."

I’ve been bullied for years about my body, in particular my calves. I danced ballet for 11 years, and almost decided to go on for a 12th, which would let me dance in the esteemed pointe shoes, the iconic mark of a true ballerina. I had never noticed what my body looked like until one day a girl in one of my classes smirked at me and said, “Your legs are JACKED!” The fact that she pretended to be my friend for that year and then proceeded to show her true feelings toward me after only exacerbated my insecurity. I remember going to the bathroom during calculus one afternoon and spending a few minutes in the stall just staring at my massive calves, standing in their black stockings and black high-heeled boots, and clutching my face in embarrassment. The smirks and condescending remarks and treatment I continued to receive for the rest of my high school career served only to sink my self-esteem to new lows. Even coming to Cornell, I’ve had friends tell me that I’m fat, that I eat a lot, that I wouldn’t fit into someone’s pants because their bottom half is thinner than mine, that I look a certain weight, that I’m going to eat *gasp* “Again?”, that I just need to eat so much because I’m taller (without realizing the unhealthy implications their comments have, which are exacerbated because they are expressed jokingly, as if my perception of my weight is trivial).

After spending the past two hours finding and reading blog posts about Asian-Americans detailing their personal experiences with being called “fat” and about how the dismissal of the possibility of Asians being fat in American media only makes size 2+ Asians feel more invisible, I cried for about half an hour. I cried because strong Asian-American female voices were reassuring me that I am not abnormal, reassuring me that my inability to lose weight (healthily or unhealthily) is not a result of my laziness, reassuring me that I am not worthless, reassuring me that I’m more than my body. 

I cried because I was a perpetrator of my own suffering. I fixate on physical appearance, and I do what is verbally considered taboo but is tacitly accepted as inevitable: I judge. Everywhere I walk, I compare every other person’s calves with mine, not missing a single person in my line of sight. Every time I see people at a party or wearing tight-fitting or revealing clothing, I compare every other person’s waist and chest and arms and feet and backside with my own. “She has no waist, but she has such beautiful legs! Her thighs are huge, but her feet are tiny! Her body is so fat, but her face is so thin!” 

And perhaps the worst, “What a pity, she has a monolid.” The guilt was unrelenting when I came to the horrifying and unforgivable realization that I, too, would grab my newborn baby and desperately want to know whether she had double eyelids. I could not stop crying. For so long, after the childhood I had experienced, I had vowed that I would love my children no matter what they looked like. I had believed that I wouldn’t destroy my children’s self-esteem and ingrain in them that they are fat or unattractive. Crying, I asked myself, “What is wrong with you? Does your baby’s appearance take priority over their well-being? Is it not enough for your child to grow up to be healthy, happy, and kind?” Health, happiness, and kindness: the physical body is a vessel that allows you to be these things, so why are you so destructively fixated on torturing and hating your vessel to match the vessels of others? Thinking about my children hating the precious people they are cripples me with guilt. We are all children to people who would be crippled with guilt and be ridden with misery if they knew how much we hated ourselves, and for such an unjustifiable reason. All I want for my children is to see them be healthy and happy and kind. They don’t need to be anything else.

I wanted to message someone I consider(ed) a close friend of mine until almost two months ago. I would have messaged you or talked to you about this, because I miss talking to you about things, and because this is just something I’d be comfortable talking to you about. But we’re not close anymore, it seems, and this will be the second time in my life, and in the past year that I’ve had to come to terms with the fact that, no matter how much I miss someone, they may never come back. 

So, instead, I’m posting this on Cornell Confessions because I want you all to hear this. I’m pretty sure I’ve added enough details in this post so that my friends know who I am."

Hey dude! Stop measuring the size of your penis. In my opinion for the same reason that someone should not be ashamed of a micro-penis or a milli-penis (!) a guy should not be proud of his large penis. You can usually be proud of something that YOU have achieved or help to achieve. Something that is about your body and you did not have any choice about it is not YOUR problem. Go and learn some good manners and etiquette and good social behaviors to impress your dream girl."

To a girl I know:

I first met you this year in the dorm and fell into a puppy love crush when I saw you. I had never been successful in getting girls, but you were a gem of beauty and grace that I had never seen before. You were spunky, energetic, and full of life. And yet, you were open to conversations with me. Your down-home attitude toward socialization made me feel that you were one of the special few at Cornell; the kind of person who doesn't care about someone's social status as long as they're a decent human being. I've found other girls at Cornell who I've loved and lost, and you've given me advice on them from time to time. 

Lately, I've noticed that my feelings for you haven't changed a bit. I think you're the most beautiful, sweet, and down-to-earth girl on campus. I've been itching to tell you how I feel, and I've danced around the subject. We've had conversations about relationships, how you perceive me, how others perceive me, and I realize that you've been one of the few people to not judge me. That hasn't affected anything I've done to/with you because I can dissociate my personal life and work life, but I really like you, and I want to spend more time with you. 

But my life experience has told me that real life isn't like what you see in the movies. The nerdy guy doesn't get to be with the beautiful cheerleader at the end of it all. The nerd goes back to do his work and maybe have sex once in his life, and the cheerleader gets to be with whomever she wants to, and the world doesn't take a second glance at the situation. Maybe it's the way the spirits of the universe intended for my life to go, but I refuse to believe that we don't have a shot together.

I can't get into a relationship with you for several reasons, but mostly because I just think it'll be impossible for someone as charming and beautiful as you to ever find it in your heart to like someone like me. There are other reasons we've discussed as well. In four years, we'll both have graduated, and we'll offer the world whatever we can do best. But, if you think you're the person I'm talking about, just slip a note underneath my door (anonymously) and just tell me if I'm in over my head, or if, perhaps, you like me back. We'll never have to talk about this again, and I'll pretend this never happened. But please help me bring closure to these feelings so I can get back to work.

And even if you're not the girl I'm talking about, slip a note under your guy friend's door and let him know how much he means to you. You'll make his month, I promise."

Hey there, this is OP from #5520. You know what? After receiving such negative comments from strangers who suggested ending my relationship with my bf because he hasn't visited me...I've realized that these things don't matter. He actually loves me and I'll be damned if even such an obstacle on a bad day would stop us! What do you all know? It could all be circumstantial. Stop generalizing and making mountains out of molehills! And to everyone who's always thinking about everyone else's two cents on your relationship--they don't actually know it--you do! So let's have some faith in our own judgment. 

Peace, love, and hope."

I think there's a middle ground between what post 5538 said and what black rights movement advocates are working for. I'm kind of tired too of hearing things like ""yeah FUCK white people""  -- and even though I'm not white, it's just tiring to see minorities, and particularly blacks think that they are entitled to be racist, just because someone else was racist first. I'm all for the black rights movement but can we please do it in a way that empowers black people instead of trying to drag everyone else down? Don't make it a war between black people and white people, because that is exactly what reaffirms underlying racist beliefs and stereotypes. You're being intellectually dishonest if you think that you're allowed to beat down on white people under the flag of ""anti-racism"", while they can't even judge you because that's ""racism""."

Responding to #5512, for being critical of my preparedness capabilities. I was not criticizing people for not having bunkers, see you are missing the point must have a problem reading a simple paragraph, and just jump to conclusions all of a sudden. I was being critical of those who live in cities, as cities have the potential to be very dangerous....anyways do whatever you wish, it's your life. You can prepare even at school by having a ""bug out"" bag or something in your dorm or apartment where you store a medical kit and supplies just in case a natural disaster or something more serious were to occur. I worked for a government agency previously that dealt with national security measures and we had to estimate the number of ""average joes"" that would perish in a disaster, and can tell you that no government agency is looking out for you, unless you take the initiative and prepare no matter how small, yourself."

I think the idea of a sorority, a group of sisters to support you in good times and bad, sounds so wonderful. Here at Cornell I'm so far from home, and the idea of having a house and people to come home to seems really nice.

What puts me off is the reality of sororities. Watching 70-80 girls all dressed the exact same way (large shirt, Canada Goose coat, leggings, Uggs) parade through campus does not make me want to join. The informational meeting I attended at the beginning of last semester, where I was sitting in a room full of skinny white girls with long, straight hair, carrying expensive purses and tote bags, wearing short dresses and big chunky necklaces, just made me feel so out of place. Like I could feel everyone staring at me, wondering what the hell I thought I was doing there. Not to mention that, in the state where I'm from at least, sorority girls are known to be the cruelest, bitchiest, most stuck up people who will pretend to like you but secretly talk trash behind your back. All the ones I've known and met have done nothing but be pretentious to me because I have short, dyed hair and don't have the money to dress the way they do.

Obviously not every single sorority girl looks and acts the way I've described (I do know there are sororities dedicated to being multicultural and all), but I've just never actually had a good experience with these girls, and I feel like I could never fit in. I'm Hispanic, so I could join a Hispanic sorority, except I don't fit the stereotypical description of a Hispanic person (aka I'm pale and light haired), so I would feel like the odd one out. I'm bisexual, which scares people away for some reason, even though I'm in a serious relationship with a wonderful boy. I'm poor. I don't like shopping. I like marching band and hiking and animals and science, and I love playing video games and reading in my spare time. I keep my hair cut short and I love to dye it bright colors. I don't like wearing a lot of makeup. I'm most comfortable in jeans and a t-shirt, though I do really love dresses (just not super short, loose-fitted ones). 

I just feel like I could never belong in a sorority. Even if I could get in, I would always be the odd one out, and that would be so much worse than now. I don't think there's any such thing as a sorority for people like me."

Sick and tired of all these black people tears on this page. If blacks didn't commit the vast majority of crimes in this country, our prisons wouldn't be overflowing with them. If they stopped crying wolf all the time, maybe they'd realize that someone white or of any other race has the same opportunities they do. If a white kid and a black kid both ""start from the bottom,"" they can both gets jobs at the same places and work their way up. What blacks need is a change in culture, instead of setting the example that being a ""thug"" and all that entails is cool...

Perhaps this wouldn't be happening if blacks stopped continuing to reinforce the stereotypes that undeniably encompass a majority of their population."

I love my family, but I think it's time I struck out on my own. It's hard to be independent when your family sees itself as this weird hive mind--I feel like Cersei under a less ruthless Tywin Lannister, constantly struggling to assert myself and being shut down every time. And as much as I feel responsible for them, I also don't want to give up my prime years taking on a burden that I probably shouldn't be carrying in the first place. College is supposed to be about learning and having fun, not becoming the de facto head of household. My mother gave up her life for her royally f-ed up family, and I think she expects the same of me. I'm getting the feeling that I should get the hell outta dodge before that can happen, but out of all of us, I make the most money, which means that my stipends, my grant money, my extra cash money goes to pay bills back home. How am I supposed to be independent (especially financially) when my family can take my earnings whenever they please? What happens if I do leave? How would that conversation even go?"

As a female a semi-long distance relationship, I feel it is the equal responsibility of both partners to be considerate enough of each other's time and responsibilities by sharing visiting obligations. If I am still a student at this institution and I was the last one to plan out a trip to visit you for an extended period of time, of course I am going to expect you to be the one to make the next visit to me. As much as I would have liked to visit you this semester I haven't had the chance to yet, because I've been trying to keep up with my duties as a student, and this semester's course load has demanded much more of my time that previous semesters have. I know you understand my obstacles to visiting you, I know that you love me, but what I am wondering is why you haven't made the conscious effort to plan out a weekend you'll come visit me here in Ithaca. As the one bringing in a pretty stable income I would expect you to be able to prioritize a little, maybe cut back on some of the unnecessary things you spend on--perhaps alcohol, or not eating out a few times per week, just to spare about $100 of a bus ticket to come see me--once is all I ask. 

Why this is such a hassle, I don't know-especially when you suggest we should see more of each other, and stress that the physical alongside the emotional in a relationship matter.
I love you to pieces, but please don't diminish my unfinished responsibilities here at school. 
How do you think it makes me feel when you could have seen me those few weekends you were ""bored"" and traveled somewhere else?? I'm not asking you to worship me or not have fun going places, but please stop making excuses as to why you're not manning up to come visit the person you are in love with. 

I don't want to offend you. I just miss you and don't know how to approach you about this without sounding selfish or harsh. I guess this is just another step in our maturing process..."

Yes mother, that's why I have not held a single civil telephone call with you; you're one of the biggest shrews I've ever known, and I would appreciate it if you don't start every telephone call with comments on how much I need to lose weight/cut my hair/try to make myself more attractive. And for whom? Because I'm pretty sure you'd lose your shit if I ever met a guy."

Sick and fucking tired of all these white people tears on this page. You want to know what is racist? You telling people of color how to act. You know what is racist? Thinking you know better than people of color. You know what's racist? Trying to dictate the way people of color get our freedom. You know what is racist? Getting all upity and sad when people of color want to discuss issues that face us without white people coming in and telling us how the fuck we should act. Who the fuck are you to come in here and tell other people how we ought to fight for our rights that are daily infringed. How fucking dare you tell another person when or how to get what is ours. You want to help end racism? Shut the fuck up. We don't need your input, because we've seen how white people ""end racism"" and black and brown people are still daily dying in the streets at the hands of our government, being disenfranchised by the millions, and given disproportionately long prison sentences due to racist sentencing guidelines. I've had enough of your fucking white tears. Get over yourselves and maybe think about why people of color find it so fucking annoying that white people have to stick their noses into everything. The world will survive if you just sit back for once and let people of color decide our own future by ourselves. We want to determine who we are and where we are going and how we are going to get our rights for once in our 400 year history in this country and we can't even do that because white people feel bad. Use your white guilt for something useful, but stop bothering us with it."

Nogwit  Mennza (not a name, don't worry Admins):

I am grateful for your name, and hope you do still watch the greatest show of all time, even without me. It's only fitting, with that beautiful, beautiful name of yours. I am glad to have known you, and always will be. I am grateful for your exquisite and surprisingly diverse taste in art. If I ever meet someone else who has seen what you have, or who shares what you and I share, I will be amazed. I am grateful for your smile and for the conversation. I am grateful for the walks. I am grateful for your hair and even for that split-second inadvertent touch of hands at lunch. Had I known what was coming, I would have gone for the hug right then. I am grateful for your kind soul and kindred spirit. I am partially glad that you don't follow this page, and yet partially sad that you won't have the opportunity to hear this. Still, I thank you for the closure. 

I agree with 5500: I should not and do not have any animosity towards you, because I am not entitled to be with you. Not to mention, I have done this infatuation thing with about a billion people, so I'm quite used to moving on and accepting the reality that I am partially to blame for all this emotion.

However, I can't help but feel some sadness. Not the mopey, complaining, self-deprecatory kind of sadness. More like the ""This time truly might have been different"" kind of sadness. I wish I hadn't allowed myself to get infatuated so many times before. If I had just played things safe until now, I 'd be able to distinguish my real feelings for you from my false feelings for so many others. But I'll never know. Though I suppose it doesn't matter now. 

I hope your rejection will not, as they often do, signal a sudden aversion from you towards me. I will still look forward to our walks and to hearing more about your tastes and to seeing you when I am blessed with the opportunity. I hope you will still enjoy, as you seemed to before, our time together or our conversations apart. I hope you will not in any way, shape or form change the way you approach me just because of the rejection. You have long since been forgiven, because you did nothing wrong. Please don't allow a great, budding friendship to fall apart. As Louie said (and if I haven't given myself away yet, I certainly have now), ""I will wait."" That is to say that I will patiently and happily soak up our friendship for as long as we both shall live, even if I no longer foresee anything becoming of it.

I do wonder something though--and if you're as real as you seem to be, you might tell me if I get the courage to ask--why not? I ask, not because I feel like I should have finally been able to succeed and want to know why I didn't. That is the mentality of those whom 5500 criticizes. I ask, only out of curiosity. I promise I wouldn't be hurt if you told me, no matter what you said.

Much love."

To #5475:

I'm a guy who stopped talking to my best friend because she didn't reciprocate the feelings I had for her. Even though this circumstance may be different from yours, I think everyone can relate to the loss of a special someone you cared about with all your heart. From my point of view, I realized I shouldn't be stuck in the past and should always strive to be moving forward in life. My silence doesn't mean I don't forgive the person that hurt me- I still think about her every night. I'm just using the time to heal and become a better person. You say that this bridge is waiting for me to cross, but I'm not walking backwards anymore. I still miss my best friend, and I hope she'll build up the courage to cross that bridge herself. Even though I'm moving on, I'm a pretty easy guy to find. I wish you all the best #5475!"

To the person who complained about being called selfish for having a private apocalypse bunker:
Please, PLEASE don't be all like ""you had it coming for you"" just because someone doesn't have the thousands of dollars lying around to build a massive underground apocalypse-proof bunker with ""a drinking water plant, a septic tank, massive generators, fuel storage tanks, along with televisions, telephones, a bathroom and showers, and comfy beds.""  Hell, if a nuclear war does start, the only way I'll be able to ""get underground"" is if I dig myself a hole BECAUSE THAT'S ALL I CAN AFFORD.  Yes, you have every right to spend your money your way.  In fact, you might even be in the same financial situation as me but with different priorities, so yeah you do your thing and that doesn't make you selfish.  But laughing at other people who chose to spend their money differently (ie on tuition/food/rent) and implying that they deserved to die because they weren't prepared makes you an ASSHOLE.  That's on par with laughing at all the civilians who've lost their lives in countless previous wars/epidemics ""because they weren't prepared."""

Being a physics student in university, naturally I am surrounded by a plethora of highly intelligent peers. The one complaint I hear the most is not whether someone failed a test or is worried about getting into grad school, rather it is the fact that they can't seem to find a girlfriend. That being said, I also know many highly intelligent guys who have amazing relationships; in fact intelligent people have the potential to have the greatest relationship because they can be so creative with birthday, Christmas gifts, and other aspects of the relationship! However, there is at least a significant proportion of highly intelligent guys who mope around, complaining about being single and not knowing what to do about it. There are plenty of articles online saying that the solution is to stop being so arrogant about intelligence and to “chill out” but I think the problem really boils down to being too idealistic about the natural selection process. 

“My genes are superior, why doesn’t she choose me?”

The first thing you need to realize is that getting a girlfriend is a skill that needs to be developed, just like soldering a circuit board, just like doing surface integrals in your Calc. III class. While you were sitting at home perfecting word for word the solution to your next real analysis homework, your competitor was out there performing some APPLIED analysis on the girl psyche and figuring how to woo her heart and make her smile. That's why he has a hot girlfriend and you have, well, your left hand. Too many intelligent guys think that women are things to be earned, things that they are entitled to. That if you worked hard and made a lot of money or became famous in your field, women will come flocking to you. This may be true if you’re Elon Musk, but for the rest of us mortals, finding a (hot?) girl that is worth hanging onto requires practice and diligence. Sure if you’re striving to be the next Newton and couldn’t give two shits about human intimacy then please be my guest and continuing carving out human history undistracted. Most guys want successful, enriching relationships and therefore need to put the work in, to get the work out.

“I have a 6-pack and I’m on my way to a PhD in physics, so what’s the problem?”

I have many friends who are both intelligent and physically fit, the two traits required for successful natural selection, or you would think anyway. One of them said to me the other day “I’m working up to 205lb on the bench press, unless I hit that, I’m not going to talk to any girls.” This is exactly the type of thinking that will make sure you stay single until you’re 80 and your balls turn into raisins. Being able to bench press or being brilliant at electrodynamics and being a good (enjoyable) boyfriend are completely different faculties. If you asked any given girl (even the most intelligent ones), most of them will say being intelligent or talented in a certain field is a bonus and NOT the deciding factor in picking a boyfriend. At the end of the day, the goal of every girl on earth is to be happy and you can provide this happiness (and receive it too!) by developing loyalty, sympathy, and a sense of humor (characteristics that were unanimously voted the most sought after in a guy by girls across the 11 dimensions).

“The problem is them, not me!”

At the end of the day you might think everything I’ve said is bullshit and that the only reason why you don’t have a girlfriend is because there are no intelligent but pretty girls out there that suit you. But just remember this, given the off chance that you do one day come across that unicorn-of-a-girl, do you really want your romantic abilities to be as linear as your ODE assignment?"

I've never had patience for freshman asking for easy classes or easy professors or asking for how to get straight A's or whatever. I didn't have patience for it even as a freshman. You're not in Kansas anymore, kids -- you're not here to make grades, you're here to learn, and I know they said that in high school but this time it's actually true. If you got here by being lazy and always choosing the easiest route through life, then you'd either better transfer out or make a big change in attitude right now because you WILL be challenged here and you'd better figure out how to deal with that. Take classes that you want to take and figure out what you want to learn because if you're doing what you like it won't matter if it's hard, and as long as you learned something it's not going to matter what grade you got in the end. If you can't do that, at least get out of the hair of those of us who actually care because frankly, you're a drag."

There will always be bigots, jerks and assholes out there who disagree or have backwards thinking and they're always going to try to put in their two cents, but that doesn't mean that all white people are like that and therefore shouldn't be in the conversation and just because they have something to say/contribute doesn't mean that they're not listening!

I'm fucked up.  And I've been fucked over.  Which has fucked me up more.  But recently I've worked to become more stable and to understand how my interactions with others affect them and myself.

But because these sorts of things have fucked me over so terribly in the past, I'm more than a little terrified.  I don't know how much more of that I can honestly take

My friends tell me I am selfish for preparing for something serious like a nuclear exchange. I mean I want to survive if shit hits the fan. My family built a massive bunker in the mountains and are storing large amounts of food, water, and supplies for the scenario. It's my right as a free American to fulfill my pursuit of happiness, which is to feel secure all the time. I'm sorry if shit hits the fan and you're unprepared. You will have to suffer like the rest who don't prepare while I live out the days in my underground bunker with my family and select best friends, which is fully equipped with food, supplies, a drinking water plant, a septic tank, massive generators, fuel storage tanks, along with televisions, telephones, a bathroom and showers, and comy beds. You name it I got it and thought about how to live in style when the end of days come. I even have connections to other fellow ""preppers"" like me via satellite phones and internet, and a massive mountaintop antenna array that was designed by AT&T to be blast proof and could withstand a nearby nuclear exchange, which connects me to the private satellite network company. I will live through the apocalypse or zombie attack in style. I mean even Cornell said it is possible we could have a zombie apocalypse (some recent study came out and was featured on the website), where massive amounts of people are getting infected by a disease, does not mean people will be eating each other like you see in sci-fi movies like you probably assume because you have no connection to reality.

However, I've been thinking about it, and I realized that there was actually a cultural change - except I only realized after having a terrible first semester.
All my life, I studied at a school I loved. Although people complained about schoolwork and things like infrastructure and administration, I never met a single person who GENUINELY hated the school. At Cornell, however, I see more students complaining about things than actually rejoicing their education here, whether it's on Yik Yak, or just during everyday conversations. The constant moaning about the weather (which honestly isn't even that bad), or the complaints about classes and work are extremely depressing. Since I realized this, my life has been so much better. I have begun to look past this layer of glumness and find people with more positive attitudes. I have discovered that there are people here who love Cornell - it's just that the whiners, cloaked in anonymity, are much more vocal. Now, I constantly remind myself to see past the negativity and revel in the opportunities I have been provided. It's a privilege to be here, and I can finally, after one semester of gloominess, say that I genuinely love Cornell."

i hate how people act like the racial issue in america is complicated or nuanced, or needs some sort of a dialogue to get resolved. We dont want to compromise, we dont want your opinion, or your two cents, or your input. just fucking listen. stop letting police officers get away with shooting unarmed black people in the street and then claiming the victim was ""no angel"". Stop passing minorities over for jobs we are more than qualified for. stop flying confederate flags and saying its ""southern heritage"" or the ""southern way of life"" because we all know what that fucking means. You say we always talk about race? we'll stop when you fucking listen"

Dear Confessions page,

All of these posts about privilege, racism, classism, ableism, sexism, etc. are just stupid on here. Yes, there is inequality in the United States, but just because someone is, say, a white heteronormative male doesn't mean they have no place in a discussion, similarly just because one is, say, a handicapped african-american pansexual genderqueer mermaid-kin (yes tumblr, i know) doesn't mean they have the most important or well-informed say in a discussion either. There is more to a person and their intelligence or knowledge than the color of their skin, their family's financial status, their gender, etc. As soon as you reduce things to strictly appearance, as so many of you seem to do, you make your argument seem even worse and make people, who may have good ideas/thoughts on the matter, shut you out.

Sincerely,
Someone who is sick of this shit getting in the way of productive discourse"

This one goes out to all the people who do not understand the concept of bending the rules. You will encounter times in your life where you will be faced with the option of looking the other way to help someone out in a totally HARMLESS way, at the expense of not following some bureaucratic bullshit rule (i.e. you have to have your Cornell ID to get into a gym class- even if you have a gym membership and know your id number). Really think hard about how much it would hurt you to let one slide every now and then, while also considering how much you might be helping out a fellow human being. Odds are nothing will happen to you if you look the other way, and someone else will have been spared some distress. Don't be the cop that gives a ticket to a speeder every time, regardless of their excuse. Don't be that guy. Be a brain user, not a rule follower."

First of all I have to say I'm sorry. I really thought you were gay and you looked really cute.

I came to Cornell for the fancy title that came along once graduating. Turns out I have screwed myself over. Since I have gotten here I work my ass off just to nearly pass, my grades are shit, I've made some mediocre friends and have no life outside of school.. All to say I graduated from Cornell. Turns out that this title won't mean anything since I can't keep up with the work, don't have any meaningful friendships here and have very minimal extracurricular activities to say I did. I'm so sick of trying so hard to feel so unaccomplished, it really messes with my head."

I prevented myself from asking her out and I'm pretty sure I was blushing for a good amount of it. I might go for it."

So I'm pretty sure I was asked out on a date by another guy. I would classify myself as a straight male. I don't know exactly how to tell if it's just him being friendly or wanting a little something more. He asked me to catch up over a coffee or meal, but it's only been a few days since I saw him. It's also possible he might be being extra friendly so he can stay somewhere near NYC for free when he travels. Anybody have any advice on this? There's no real way to avoid him as he works where I always go to eat. He's not in this group so don't think this is about you."

Too often, brilliant students come to this brilliant campus and forget who they are in the midst of comparing themselves to others, and by allowing perceived failure to bring them down. Well , technically, I wouldn't say allow, because it's quite difficult not to when you have high expectations for yourself and lofty goals coming here. But you know what's worse of a ""failure"" then your first bad prelim grade or multiple rejections? Allowing it to consume you, redefine you, and take control of your life. That's ultimate failure- when instead of fighting, challenges are able to destroy you; to the point where you become no more- where you stop being passionate about the causes you once were before arriving to this campus, and let the sucesses of others being you down. Well, I have something to say to this as I once experienced all of this during my first semester here. Instead of working so hard only to get half hearted results, study differently! Yeah , first test scored might be bad but that's ok because It was the first one! It's ok not to be perfect because success doesn't come immediately, it takes time. And yes, success does take admitting that you may be a below average student right now, but you won't stay there. You will improve your ways, and fight on. Instead of working harder, work smarter. Instead of studying alone, study with a group. Didn't get the internship? Call and ask why. Success at a higher level( college and behind) takes developing yourself, and improving yourself. That's why college is supposed to make you grow. You are here because you are hard working and intelligent and capable, be you, and stay you, one of the top universities in the world picked YOU! You have what it takes to succeed, think about what those qualities are; just remain faithful to yourself and don't give up."

Okay so most of this is mainly to vent about a friend being annoying as FUCK, but it's definitely applicable to life: 
1. If you complain and ask a friend to give you advice, then completely ignore the advice/refute everything they're saying in an attempt to help you and how it won't work, then DON'T come back in a few days and complain about the same shit. It's annoying and rude.
2. DONT LIE. Ever. To anyone. It's rude and makes you untrustworthy. I'm not talking little white lies or even exaggerating. I'm talking turning ""they said they were busy and can't hang out"" into ""They said they hate me and I'm a loser :///"" (Yes that actually happened. At that point, you're a liar)
3. Don't judge people before even knowing them. Don't think you know them and then call them losers are jerks. It just makes the world an angry place.
4. Don't complain about things but then take NO actions to fix it (similar to #1, I know. But still different). 
5. Don't form relationships out of desperation or in hopes to complete yourself. Usually, they cause codependency and unhealthy relationships/reliance on others. You need to be able to be happy with yourself before anyone else can be happy with you. 

Sorry. REALLY just needed to vent. Because after saying these things over and over and over, yet you still ignore them, I'm done trying to help you. At a certain point, only you can help you. You can't expect everyone else to change your life to make you happy. You need to make that change. You need to make a valid effort in changing the things in your life that you're unhappy about in order to make a difference."
2617,2015-04-07 18:46:22,"5432
Let me preface this with two facts: 1) I am a gay man. 2) I have no problem with attractive women.

Now for my admittedly hypocritical rant, which will almost certainly draw the ire of internet warriors. 

I hate how attractive women seem to think every man they see must be attracted to them. I can almost see it in their eyes, like they're just waiting for me to try and talk to them. Unfortunately, I love people and try to be kind and nice anywhere I go, so I probably will talk to them. Apparently I don't look gay because they almost always take on the persona of ""standoffish attractive women trying to dismiss desperate love-struck boy.""

Ladies: I LIKE MEN. I don't care about you. And, quite frankly, I'm sure there are a lot of straight men who don't care about you either. For example, there are a lot of attractive men in the gay male community. But if they open their mouths and ignorance, superficiality, or trivial and uninteresting shit comes out, I automatically lose ALL attraction to them. So as far as those gorgeous attributes might take you, I'm willing to believe there are straight men who will immediately dismiss you if that's all you have. Your ego can be so infuriating that I sometimes consider going out of my way to make sure you know that I'm NOT attracted to you. But I'm too nice for all that.

Worst of all, sometimes attractive women seem like they want you to engage them. If I were straight, I'd consider this to be an incredibly sadistic and ill-advised game to play with someone's hopes or heart (though that's not to say that men can't demonstrate equal or greater cruelty.)

More broadly: Folks, you don't know everything about a person by just looking at them, OK? You just don't. Stop thinking you do and hope people surprise you. Because whether its sexuality, race, religion, gender, or any number of other things, assumptions will almost never lead you down a righteous path.
 
Alright, I'm done."

A couple of recent confessions were about guys feeling bad about the size of their sexual organs. Just as a reminder, another expression for sex is ""to make love"". The physical aspect is just one of the sides of a good intercourse in a relationship, the other important factors are emotion, kindness, unselfishness, being concerned of your partner, mutual understanding and many other things. If you think you have imperfection in the physical aspect just work on other aspects. And of course, stop comparing yourself with actors in porn, not all the males in a good healthy relationship have penises equal to the size of a baseball bat."

I suffered from chronic anxiety. I always picture the worst things that will happen to me (rejections, rebuffs, etc.) in my mind, especially when it comes to dealing with other people. Positive reinforcement didn't help at all. Thanks to my anxiety, I lost a lot of friends who eventually got fed up dealing with me. I could not get involved in a relationship for fear of getting rejected and bringing misery to my partner. I retreated to my own world just so that I won't screw up everyone else with my pessimism. I could only blame myself and the negative energy in me. I thought of ending my own life to liberate myself from this anxiety and others from the negative energy I am giving them. Besides, I don't see myself surviving in society either as a social outcast."

I came into engineering as a guy who followed the rules. I was naive enough to believe that hard work will help you succeed. This place changed my belief because here hard work does not necessarily translate into success. Freshman year, my GPA was low. My friends had higher ones and I thought to myself. What am I doing wrong? I put in more work than them. I don't copy homework or cheat on tests. Then, through talking with upperclassmen and older friends, I began to put together the pieces. I started playing the system. I took easy business classes to boost my GPA. I started copying homework and cheating on tests. My GPA has only gone up since freshman year. People will tell you that GPA is just a number and blah, blah, blah. THIS IS NOT TRUE. If you want a good job, you need a high one or companies won't even give you a second look. That is the harsh reality. I started playing the odds and taking chances because I have nothing to lose and everything to gain. And we all know it's only after we've lost everything, that we're free to do anything."

I loved my four years at Cornell and it will be sad to leave. But one thing I really hate is that many locals who work on campus, local businesses, the cab companies, and city services like TCAT are racist against Asians, particularly against Chinese, Koreans and Indians. And they are very open about it. I'm happy to be leaving this behind. I hope Ithaca wakes up and addresses this."

Running into the little sister of an old high school friend on Spring Break:

Her: So how's Cornell going? 

Me: I hate it. So much in fact that I leave most weekends. Here's some advice for you since you're starting to apply to college: the name of a school doesn't matter. What matters most is if its a place you can see yourself being happy and successful, and you can surround yourself with others who feel the exact same way."

One thing I can't stand is when people dislike me or have a low opinion of me for no particular reason. I can accept it if I know I've done something to wrong someone. But I feel like there are people who look down on me just for being me--most notably those who are supposed to be closest to me at this university--and it really does bother me."

Fuck! After a wonderful spring break here at Ithaca...silence, peace, and quiet, and all... my roommate is back. And people are slowly coming back to campus. This week made me realize how much I love not being forced to talk to people and just deal with people in general. I realized how much I love living alone in my own space without having to hear my roommate doing stuff in the background. I might sound selfish and egoistic but I really do love spending time with myself. This week I have really focused and concentrated on loving myself as this was a struggle for me for a long time now. And I was doing so good until people started crawling back to campus. I just wish I didn't have to say ""hi!"" to my hall mate or anyone for that matter. I wish I just could go about doing my business without really having the need to do small talks with people and truly not caring about it. Don't get me wrong! I want to make human connections but I want to have quality conversations with people, to understand them, and to embrace them. But I really don't want to fucking deal with petty socializing."
2673,2015-04-05 00:34:17,"5376
I spent this week with family in another part of the country, and realized that there are parents out there who are encouraging of their children instead of screaming at them and beating them when they don't live up to expectations. There are parents who listen to their kids. There are parents who are fair and consistent with rules. There are parents who, when their kids don't get a good grade, sit with their kid and help their kid figure out what to do next time to do better instead of punishing them, withholding food, or hitting them. And now I feel really sad. Because those parents weren't my parents, and I never knew that what I went through wasn't normal. I just know that when I have children, I know what I'll do. And it won't involve putting them down or physically abusing them."

My parents keep telling me that they're not going to pay for Cornell anymore because I'm not getting the grades they expect and participating in extracurriculars they don't approve of. I don't qualify for federal work study or anything like that so I'd have to somehow come up with the money myself. I don't know anything about students loans or interest rates. I've never held a job and don't have any job skills. I don't want to leave Cornell but I just don't know what to do."

I have a lot of siblings. Growing up, we weren't all that close but being away from them has made me miss all of them a lot. I call, I text and on breaks some of us have a lot of fun together. But it scares me what is going to happen in a few years. Like, when I’m out of school and have to work and they’re in high school and college and working in other places, what’s going to happen? I didn't realize that when high school ended, our times all being altogether ended too. One is already moving to a different country! People say you can always make new friends, but you can’t make new family! This isn't a big problem but for me, it’s still sad. Is anyone in the same boat?"

I have a micropenis. I am completely terrified that I will never be able to find love, since sex is obviously very important in a relationship. I can usually a couple of days in a row without thinking about my size but the moment I do I get really anxious and horrified. I have had the opportunity to have sex but I am too scared to show a girl my penis. I know this seems like a minor issue but I am absolutely horrified that I will never be able to be in a relationship because of my penis size. This thing has affected my confidence so much. The worst thing is I know I can't do anything about it. It is not something I can help...i'm just stuck with it. I'm just assuming that I will be alone and a virgin for the rest of my life. I am nearly 20 years old and I have never had anything remotely close to a girlfriend. I'm not sure how much longer I can live with this. I know it seems ridiculous to worry so much about this but I am extremely concerned. Sorry for the rant...I can't really tell anyone about this and I just had to get it off my chest."

As I sit opening my second bottle of wine, it becomes more clear why my hall mates are starting to look down on me, why I'm 'that kid who drinks too much'.  I had my shit together first semester.  I really did.  I worked hard in classes and got grades I was pleased with.  I avoided the freshman 15 and even got fitter than I was over the summer (as if that even matters).  I have (or I suppose had, who knows at this point) a great group of friends.  It wasn't all sunshine and rainbows, I'll grant you that.  I mean, I failed my first prelim.  I had an ill-advised hook-up or two.  I've gone out and had too much to drink a few (too many) times.  You know, it was first semester freshman year.  But largely, it was all good.

Well, to save anyone the long read, my friend group started to dissolve.  And I even anticipated that, I mean, I knew that first semester kids hang out with their hall mates and then start to branch out during second semester.  I told myself to not get too attached to this group of friends and to force myself to branch out (but of course I didn't because I'm a fool at best).  But when it actually happened, when 'my' group fell apart, it hurt pretty bad.  And so I drank to make it hurt a tad less.  At first it was a sip of wine or a nip of vodka here and there.  But we all know how that ends up.  Soon it was a few shots, which transitioned to getting smashed each evening just to get by.  

Well to no one's surprise, I can't stop now.  I'm either drunk, trying to get there or hungover and rushing to do the bare minimum of work to get by.  When I don't drink, my chest constricts, my hands tremble and my spine itches.  Any sort of anxiety or emotional pain simply doesn't evaporate until I've had a few drinks.  Confidence?  Hah!  Not until at least a few shots in.

And that's why my hall mates now look down on me I suppose.  I hate to be 'O Woe is Me', but it's not amazing to enter the study lounge each day to knowing smiles and the inevitable ""Well how was your evening OP?"" and not know the answer.  It's not amazing when one of the few people who's still close with you comes up to you and offers to be moral support at the AA meeting you forgot agreeing to go to while you were hammered (though I suppose I'm pretty damn lucky to have someone who'd be willing to do so).  It's not amazing to feel terrified in the morning when you can't remember what you did last night.

It's not amazing.  In fact, it's pretty shitty."

I once fell for a girl who I genuinely grew attracted to for qualities that I came to know of after spending some time with her. There are things like certain mannerisms that you may notice and smile about but can't openly say that you appreciate without coming off as weird. Just how society works. She was truly one of a kind and I loved her. Of course, I thought she was good looking too. 

I have a gut feeling for what she may actually think of me but there's no way of knowing for sure. Right now, based on how so many ""conversations"" went in the past it just seems like she was never interested. I thought she hated me longest time. After all the shit I told her, I have no way of saying anything more to her. And that's what my friends advised me to do. Just stop what I'm doing and forget about it because it's just a bad idea and can only end badly if not worse. 

What I did was probably one of the most irrational things I ever did. I was so stubborn and tried to go for something that I knew couldn't work. I feel that I won't regret what I sent her because I ended up telling her how I felt, even though I did it in a such a bizarre way and with some exaggeration of details. I feel really bad for having bothered her when she's in such a busy stage of her life. Maybe if I stopped trying to talk to her after when I saw her last, things wouldn't be where they are now -- broken."

Will you start burning witches next? I can talk about dead babies and getting Parkinson's or whatever I want. Why not the opposite? Why not believe if you DON'T talk about them, they will happen? I choose to subscribe to that nonsense. So if you don't talk about getting sick and dying of cancer, I take that as meaning you want me to die of cancer! How dare you! And of course, wanting it to happen increases the chances of it happening as has been shown countless studies showing the effectiveness of prayer."

You have been reading all these posts of seniors talking about graduation on Cornell Confessions and asked me how I felt. At the time, I gave you a very generic answer, but this is how I truly feel.

I think like most Cornellians, I came to Ithaca with big dreams and grand plans for my future. When I first got here, I made a lot of great friends and academically put myself in a great position. However, I always wanted to make myself more than just a boy with big silly ideas and actually do something significant with my life. But when one of my life goals flopped, I was devastated that it was so easy for me to surrender my principles. The disappointment in myself led me to sabotage most of my friendships and let my schoolwork go to crap. I lived my life aimlessly without purpose, and I begin to rely on alcohol not because it helped me forget what kind of loser I was becoming but because alcohol was just a better pilot of my life than I was.

I was so emotionally unstable that I jumped into an awful relationship with the absolutely wrong girl. We dated for far too long, and I fooled myself to believe that one day I was going to marry her. In hindsight, I was never really happy in that relationship and even though we dated for almost two years, I do not think I ever truly loved her. She was controlling, and I was constantly miserable. However, I couldn't leave the distraction from my other failures that her comfort brought me. Thus, I just learned to live with sadness in order to forget my own failures. Eventually that affected my grades even further, but this time it also turned me really obese. 

Then last semester (my senior year), I walked in on my girlfriend cheating on me. Later I found out that she had been cheating on me for months. I really hope that none of you experience what I felt that day, but for days and weeks, I couldn't even move, eat, think or sleep. Then two weeks later my parents dropped a bomb and told me that they got divorced. 

My already broken world came shattering down on me. My schoolwork meant absolutely nothing to me, and my once bright image of my future seemed like a nonsensically romantic passage from a book I had read a long time ago. However, even at that moment, when I expected my life to completely crumble down and consume me, I realized that I was still somehow standing up. That is when I found my last few friends struggling to keep me standing. 

That's the moment that I realized that life isn't a fucking romantic poem or a play. It's a dirty and gritty back alley fistfight with no rules. I always thought that maybe I had finally reached the low point of my life, and that things were just going to magically turn around. No, life is going to constantly beat you till your eye socket caves and drowns you in your blood and pus. It's our job to put our guards up and throw everything back at it. I was lucky enough that despite many of my questionable actions, a couple of my friends stuck around to make sure I wasn't knocked out for good.

The moment I realized that simple but harsh truth, I finally took charge of my own destiny and began to realign my life. I started getting my work done and wrote great graduate school applications. I started working out obsessively and since the breakup I have lost over 35lbs. It may be extremely shallow, but it was the greatest feeling when girls started noticing me again. When a girl said to me, """"holy crap you got hot..."""" I excused myself and went to the restroom and cried. It was the most difficult couple of months of my life, but I was also lucky enough to get into my dream grad schools and even a couple of job offers.

I finally got my life in order, but I also realized that without a light at the end of the tunnel, life was nothing more than a meaningless brawl that will eventually kill me. I tried my best to move on from what happened with my parents and my ex, but deep down I didn't think I could ever trust or fall in love with someone ever again. I knew I had to keep fighting, but I didn't know why, and sometimes I would just sit down on a bench and have a difficult time convincing myself why I should stand back up again.
That is when I first saw you. When we first met...(this is so cliche but....) my heart literally skipped a beat and my mind drew a blank for a couple of seconds, because I couldn't deal with how beautiful you looked. However, as an expert in sadness, I could immediately see through your mask and tell that you too had your heart broken and that you were also not at a great place in your life. When we started talking, I soon discovered that underneath that layer of deep sadness was the most beautiful and special person that I have met in my lifetime. I know I am not supposed to say it, but I fell in love with you the day we first met. You became the final missing piece in assembling my broken life, you taught me that I could love and trust someone again. We have only known each other for a little over a month now, but we have both helped each other heal ourselves and become better people.

So here it is.... I am looking forward to my new bright future ahead of me, but I am torn that soon we will be separated. My only regret in Cornell, even after all that drama and sadness, is that we did not meet earlier. But one day I will return to your life and Ted-Mosby-Robin you, because you are my green light across the bay.

As someone who flies thousands of miles per month and with severe depression (unrelated to Cornell), its been very intriguing to try to get in the mind of the Germanwings copilot and why he decided to bring his plane down with 150 souls on board. 

One of the things I've arrived to is that the decisions you make as a depressed person aren't necessarily yours. In fact, even making a simple decision (what to eat for lunch) sometimes seems like the hardest decision ever. Because of that, you sometimes arrive to decisions that you know aren't the right ones, without having the willpower to think about the consequences. 

Needless to say, however, he shouldn't have been flying."

In response to confession #5310 and other concerning posts I've read, I wanted to share something. I am a former EARS counselor and now I'm in the best mental health counseling program in the country. I think a lot of people would say EARS is not as good compared to CAPS/SHS, however, I can honestly say that I've learned so much more from my time through EARS compared to my current program. My current program is intense and as I said, the BEST in the country, but becoming an EARS counselor was way more arduous. We have to go through at minimum, 3 semesters of training and tons and tons of simulation tests before being decided upon our readiness by a panel. I would say, most of those counselors are better than me right now since I've forgotten some of the EARS skills I've learned. Walk-ins and calls are completely anonymous and if you are ever afraid of revealing your identity, then just give them a call [255-EARS (255-3277)]. As a former EARS counselor, we honestly have no way of tracking or knowing who you are. Tell us your story, and we will lend you our EARS."

and i can really say I expressed real love- i was there for her, and didn't expect anything in return. I guess I still love her as a person.

but in these past couple of weeks I feel like i've finally learned who she really is. i felt emotionally abused, neglected, and horrible about myself. i was there for her and when she was ok, she wasn't there for me- all of this which she admitted without blinking.

so I'm sitting at the diner at columbia with my friend and he pulls up the definition for the word 'sociopath,' and we find out she fit the criteria perfectly..."

Dear the female engineer from #5309,

I know what you feel. I've only been in Cornell this year and I hate this place so much. I feel so shameful whenever I think of what I have accomplished this year and how much money my parents spent on my education. I went to a small liberal arts college before attending here and I was so much happier there. If it were not because my parents insisted, I'd never go to Cornell in the first place. Anyhow, I only have 1 year left from graduating with a degree from an Ivy League school, so even if I fail my classes, even if I have no motivation when I get up in the morning, and even if I have suicidal thoughts, I know I will be fine at the end. Soon enough, this experience will become the past. 
Girl, I know this is tough, but you are more than what people think you should be/do. Take a break, enjoy yourself, and know that we'll be fine at the end.

Best wishes,
A female junior"

I don't know what to do anymore. I've taken all of the steps to get better...talking to a counselor, medication, etc, but nothing is working and I'm tired.

I wish I could just start college over and change every decision I ever made here. Well, only three more years to go..."

I haven't committed to going to Cornell yet, but I'm confused. I love that Cornell has a great education and it's ivy league - but that shouldn't be the only reason I'm going right? I want to go somewhere warm and urban.. where there are a lot of things to do like going clubbing, seeing concerts, meeting new people who aren't just from the same school as you! I mean..Cornell is beautiful, but I just don't know if it's for me. I want to make the right decision, how do I make the right decision?"

2740,2015-03-28 20:04:29,"5309
A lot of people have told me the ""big fish in a small pond"" experience that I'd get from going to a state school or whatever pales in comparison to the Cornell experience. The theory is that even if work yourself to death at Cornell and still don't do that well, Cornell will get you prepared for the real world. And maybe that is true; I feel like Cornell has made me a wiser person. But a conversation with my parents today forces me to wonder whether that's actually worth the emotional toll that this place takes on me. 

They were asking me whether I was happy here, and although I have my reasons for being happy (mainly my friends, they're great), I must say that in conventional terms (grades! extracurricular accomplishments! research opportunities! summer plans!), my freshman year has been tremendously unsuccessful. It hurts so much to admit that to myself and to my parents. They still think I'm good at school and accomplished outside of school, but they don't realize that that phase of my life is long gone. I do virtually no clubs, get poor grades, and there are people who probably work half as hard as I do and can still kick my ass in any subject. 

I get that college can't be all sunshine and rainbows, but I don't think it's supposed to be four years of self-loathing either. But when I look back at the amount of money my parents are pouring into this institution, and the fact that I can't even access some of the things that make Cornell great (e.g. engineering project teams, etc.) the whole thing seems so fucking pathetic. My mom and dad love me and they're paying for an education and I'm literally just pissing it away. I'm not qualified for a project team because I did conventional stuff like debate team in high school instead of robotics team; some people can just think through technical questions but I've never had to do stuff like that. And although project teams are supposed to be an environment for people to learn how to work on engineering tasks together, when you have all these brilliant kids competing, a kid like me is just going to get eaten alive. 

Not only am I not qualified for many of Cornell's project teams (which I know aren't the only way to go as far as engineering extracurriculars, but they're so heavily emphasized that it sure as hell seems that way), but I'm also not capable of handling the work here. I study and take notes and blah blah blah but my grades are mediocre. This doesn't bother me as much as the fact that I can't participate in activities (I guess being average in a bunch of smart kids is still pretty smart) , but it does rub a little salt into the wound. 

Anyways, all that stuff has me wondering why on earth Cornell took me. And I realllllly don't like to say it, but I think I know why. When I got into Cornell, I received a likely letter from the engineering school, and I was happy to get in somewhere so I didn't think much of it, until I started receiving emails from the Diversity Programs in Engineering. Then I started wondering, am I just a diversity recruit? But I figured that if I worked hard enough, I'd be able to dispel those sorts of thoughts. 

Then I got here, and slowly, little by little, lost faith in myself. I wrote applications, I studied hard for exams, I budgeted time well, and the only thing that came back to me was failure. And it's easy to forget about being such a failure when you're at college because everyone kind of suffers together. But when you come home and have to talk to your parents about school and why your friends are more accomplished than you and what they have that you don't have and all that stuff, it just makes the feeling of inadequacy resurface and hit you in the gut ten times as hard as it ever did. Basically my parents are asking me ""so, where is our money going"" and my answer is ""It's being flushed down the toilet, but I've made some friends in the process so it wasn't a total loss"" What kind of answer is that ? It's a disgrace! 

I'm a disgrace. 

Maybe I'm the only female engineer at Cornell who feels this way. But in my opinion, all the evidence points the the fact I'm not qualified. Which means Cornell shouldn't have ACCEPTED me. I am angry that they accepted me. Bridging the gender gap in engineering is important. However, I can't help feeling that by baiting me with a likely letter, Cornell was setting me up to fail. Why put me into a place where I'm obviously out of my league? Just to make Cornell's diversity statistics look nice? Is my main purpose for being at this institution just a matter of statistics? 

Sure, everyone says ""Be resilient! Persist! Apply, apply, apply!"" But just keep in mind that while I'm busy being fucking resilient and typing up applications until my fingers bleed, there are people at other schools actually spending their time on meaningful activities. Sure, maybe after applying to 3489207 clubs, I will be able to write a damn good paragraph on why I am interested in XYZ or what I like to do in my free time. But I'd rather be able to actually write a program or research something than be good at writing applications. If Cornell had rejected me, maybe I'd be doing those things right from the get go, instead of spending half my college career applying to things before ever doing a single thing of value. And I'd probably save a shitton of money as well. 

I've disappointed too many people, myself included. This is a great school, but I don't think I can access enough of its greatness to make coming to Cornell worth the financial and emotional price tag. 

I should have picked a college that wanted me for my qualifications, and not my uterus."

I find Cornell so greedy: They hold a giving day that raises $7 million, and yet, a large proportion of the studrnt body continuously struggles to make ends meet. Honestly, why can't Cornell specify where that monry will be going more so than state that donors ""choose?"" (If you're wondering what I'm referring to, see this link: https://givingday.cornell.edu/about/) For all I know, it can be going into a professor's big fat paycheck, just to cover the cost of hiring a new faculttmember that the school doesn't necessarily need.

These last couple of weeks have been so hellish that I just can't handle it anymore. During it all, I was so in the zone that even when I knew I should feel some way, I just couldn't. Or at least not until I took a second to finally breathe, and then I felt it all hit me like a train. I am so tired, have no more energy, yet so many emotions that I can't even fucking rest. It wasn't like my situation was much better before, but shit, I at least felt like I had control. Now my life feels like its going on a downward spiral, and I barely realized how far I already fell. Everything around me is crashing, because I couldn't handle all the weight, but acted like everything was good, as long as I didn't feel any pain. Well here it is. And in the end, I got no one to blame but myself. God my life sucks. I wish I could just find the way up, but everything I want involves contuining down until I come out the otherside. Is it worth it? Can I take anymore? Do I even deserve rest? Or peace? Or happiness? Can I ever be who I NEED to be, or will I always be failing to fill shoes that I am not meant for. I wish I could find a way to live without everything tearing me apart."

My little brother (16 years old at the time) wanted to be a real life superhero. He dressed up in this weird outfit made out of spandex and leather. His weapons were: pepper spray, one of my dad's expensive belts, and a tazer. He even went out at night to patrol the streets of the Upper East Side at night. He spent most of his time just brooding alone in his bedroom, reading comics and listening to Fox News for local crime at night. My parents were really getting weirded out by his antisocial behavior, so they told me to do something about it. When I went home for the summer, me and a few of my buds followed him creeping around the neighborhood. We dressed up as the Joker, the Penguin, and Lex Luthor and beat the shit out of him. 
He finally cut that shit out of his life and took up an interest in programming instead. He just got accepted into MIT.

I sometimes wonder at the similarities between what freshman archies do for D-Day and much of what is termed hazing at Cornell. We're taught, at Delta series, that even activities that seem harmless and that participants purport to engage in willingly can still be hazing. I'm certainly not advocating for hazing--which is often dangerous and, at the very least, can make participants feel uncomfortable, which should not be a factor in joining an organization. I'm just wondering why certain things that we're very careful not to do in the Greek system to avoid any possible accusations of hazing (this is in a sorority, fraternities are different I suppose), archies are free to do in public. If we did half the things they've done in the past week we'd be in trouble for hazing. 

This isn't meant to be an attack on architects because I really believe that everything they're doing is fun and harmless and a great way to bond before their biggest of the year. It's just me musing on the rather draconian way in which Greek activities surrounding new member periods have come to be dealt with."

I'm depressed, to the point of being suicidal. And as usual, I have no one to talk to. 

You're probably thinking 'Oh, s/he can talk to me!' Or 'EARS is a great resource.' But you don't get it. I can't talk to a stranger about my problems, because - and I'm the first to admit this - they are so petty. And that doesn't help me at all. The very fact that this mass of problems that drags me down and depresses me at every turn is so petty just makes me miserable.

I can't talk to my friends and family about it. I'm tired of faux support that leads to exasperation. I've made an effort to reach out, and have been shunned at every turn. No one wants to hang around a depressive.

So I put on a mask. A mask that shows to the world I'm happy and laid-back. But I really can't take it anymore.

It would be running away from my problems, but really, isn't that easier? I'm so tired. Tired of my inadequacy. Tired of my pathetic nature. Tired of trying and failing to change myself."

I'm pretty sure I've deserved to get a lot of F's during my time here, but a lot of my professors have taken pity on me because of my depression and given me D's and C's. I'm about to graduate this semester, and I can't help but feel like I don't deserve to."

It's hard to imagine that exactly one year ago, I was on the brink of committing suicide. There would be periods when I'd lock myself in the room and just drink my sorrows away for the entire week. I felt dumb. I felt unloved. I felt alone. I even remember sending out ""goodbye"" messages to my friends before making a move, apologizing for being such a pathetic excuse. 

Now, I can probably say I'm one happy camper and have never been so grateful. Sure, I still have my times when I feel down here and there but in the end, I can look back and say my experience here was worth it. Even though this is an anonymous post, I wanted to give a shoutout to all my friends who supported and trusted me all the way, even when I didn't in myself. I couldn't have done it without you all, and I'll be very sad to part ways when we graduate :( I guess this is a 2 in 1 confession... a. my suicidal contemplation last year and b. my fear of being separated from the ones I love."

I'd say that the most misogynistic group out there are Asian men, despite popular perception of them  as gentlemen and model minorities. But you gotta talk to someone and spend time with them to really know them. As an Asian person myself, I learned a lot about them from the casual conversations we had in our mother language. Even if it's just talk, I found a lot of their beliefs, values, and ideologies towards to the treatment of women to be EXTREMELY unsettling. Especially because they were serious about them."

So much to confess: 1. I hate Facebook because it makes me jealous of everyone- everyone who seems to have a richer and more interesting life than me 2. I am proud to be who I am but it seems like I am losing track these days. I fight so hard to fight for my convictions but then in the end I am a sellout like everyone else 3. I am scared I will die being someone who is so me- completely mediocre, completely average, completely normal, without achieving anything or doing something epic. 4. I can't believe I am going to be graduating soon. Feels like I just got here, still not over the initial Ithaca hatred phase. 5. I wish I had made or could make an effort to get to know more people, make more friends, hangout and visit the local places downtown, find people to jam with, find someone who would teach me how to play the guitar... I am afraid it's going to be too late, but I just suck at talking to people

I hate being that shy. I am a pretty good looking guy, interesting, funny. I get a lot of looks from very pretty girls. All I need is to get up and go talk to them, and I'm sure I'd do pretty well. However, when it comes down to it, I freeze. 5 mins before deciding to talk to them, I would imagine every favorable scenario in my head. But at the moment, when I get up, I'd be sure that they reject me. And after the moment has passed and I have done nothing about it, I regret it, because I'm sure again that it would've worked."

As a Hispanic,
I believe that its ok for people to celebrate St. Paddy's day, 5 de mayo, #nationalpuppyday, Chinese New Year, Thanksgiving, or anything you want to celebrate. I think the fact that we're in America should allow us to be a part of all of these, learn about them, and have fun. Why have a titty attack if we all celebrate Halloween and we're not celebrating hallow's eve or Valentine's day when it is supposed to be St. Valentine's feast day.

Architects, I get it that Dragon Day is your thing. I actually think it's cool, and I'm happy that you all get so into it. But, if you are harassing engineers, and interrupting our studies, don't be surprised when we're a little upset. It's one thing to interrupt a freshman lecture, but it's another to go up to engineers who are obviously studying in Duffield, dressed up as stereotypical nerds, and pour Purell all over someone's arm. That's not funny, that's harassment. Just keep in mind that engineers are typically very stressed out individuals, some of which have reached the end of their tether. If something like that happened again, don't be surprised when one of us snaps. Have your Dragon Day, go nuts. Just leave us alone, please."

Whenever I read posts in Cornell Confessions, I feel depressed because more than half of the posts are about people hating Cornell. I think it's always about transferring out, school pressure, depression, or anger about school administration. I mean, some of them are understandable to a certain degree, but it always makes me kinda guilty because I am currently really happy here and I never wanted to drop out even in my hard days. Is the name value of this school the only reason why people choose to remain and graduate Cornell?"

To people who think that just because you fart in a crowd, no one will know it was you. You're wrong. We all know. Concentrated smell, like farts, has a directionality and occupies a  close vicinity. The human brain is more than capable of putting that information together to conclude you farted."

I see a lot of posts on here and yik yak about people being depressed and stressed about college and not knowing if it's worth it and all that.

I just wanted to share my experience- I graduated last May, not from here granted, but I can tell you that everyone has those feelings, except the VERY few. Even those who you think have it together, really don't. Everyone is terrified to leave college and terrified of not finding a job and wasting their time and money here. And let me tell you that that's not true, you will not regret your time here and you will eventually find a great job. Especially since you all go to Cornell! I went to a state school, didn't get above a 3.5, didn't really put much effort into extracurriculars or making a ton of friends or partying all the time or networking, i didn't even have an internship during my 4 years. But i graduated and managed to get a research position here.
I had days, weeks, months even where I would slip into major depression just going home and crying after class and wondering wtf i'm even doing with my life.
Things will get better, I promise. It may feel tough now but it's so worth it. And maybe you don't get your dream job right after college, or even a real job in general right after college. But you're so young! Think of the people who have to go back to college in their mid 40's. You have so much time to figure things out and become who you want to become. Stop comparing yourself to others and believe in yourself! Things WILL get better!!"

Shall I be considered insane for seeking to be alone most of the time and feeling a sense of comfort from it? I don't have any sort of desire to be known at all. I would be just fine if I ceased to exist in this moment...

Yet since my eyes still wake up every morning to the flutter of birds outside my window, I say ""make every moment count for myself."" And that entails absorbing words from certain novels, making my own creations, watering my plants, soaking in the beams of light. I have been cursed with an anxious yet beautiful mind and sometimes other people just seem to not understand that...

I do not want to be normal and if this is what my heart and mind tell me to do, I shall have no problem doing it.

But, I have to admit, I do seek love. True love. I think about love so much that I'm afraid that it may become painful. I question whether true love is a myth, an illusion...

I think about love so often because I can finally say that I love myself. Others see it, I know they do. Others turn their heads. What is so wrong with finally loving the skin and mind you were given? I say nothing. I'm in a new direction and I want to show another how to love. It is beautiful in my mind and I wait for the day that my mind ceases to be tormented for the sake of another. I want to care so deeply for another yet my intense fear stops me from doing so.

Nothing hurts anymore because I have trained my mind to perceive and remember in a beautiful way. I can even say the fear I experience is beautiful. I want another to see the fear within and claim it as beautiful. Are you out there? Will you exist in my world, please?"

One time you were walking by my house at night while I was walking my dogs. You were rapping to yourself, but when you saw me you stopped and seemed embarrassed. Once you got further away from me I heard you start rapping again.

Two things:
1) don't stop rapping. I think it's cute. 
2) In the wise words of Nicki Minaj, boy you got my heart beat running away. Beating like a drum and it's coming your way. Can't you hear that boom badoom boom boom badoom boom base?"

My secret hobby is to observe people at the dining hall during breakfast.  Even though about 97% of the students are addicted to their laptops and phones, I find two or three people that have social conversations during  this time and it pleases me to see people taking their time to sit with each other and have a proper discussion (Everyone, please do this more often!).  

Especially since there is this particular girl-boy pair that aren't dating that I like to observe.  I have been getting a lot of hints from the girl that she is hopelessly in love with him while he is totally oblivious to her affections.  I wish there was some way to make it work for her.  Good luck!"

People really just piss me off. All I want is to left alone and do my own thing. Damn, I should have went to a smaller school. Oh well, I can't transfer now(3rd year). I actually hate talking in general. I really have nothing to say to anybody. Small talk is the worst. You pretend you care by asking how are classes or some nonsense about the weather, but you don't really care. No one really cares. People are just waiting for their turn to talk. Conservation of words, people (it's a thing). I wonder how I became such an antisocial introvert. But yeah, don't talk to me. You'll probably just ruin my day."

I need to cut my loses. My patience has run out. All the energy I had, has been wasted. I'm amazed, you carved a hole into something I thought was impenetrable. And then you destroyed it from the inside out. There is a crater that reminds me of what was once there, but that doesn't matter. I don't care. Maybe this is for the better, because I knew everything was spiraling down either way. This way I don't fall with it all. I followed it deep down, much farther than I would like to admit, but at least I still have enough strength to find my way back up. A few seconds out, these feelings were so intense, that ending it sounded so much more pleasing than losing it all. But I wasn't even given the choice. I didn't lose, I just don't care enough to hold it anymore. My sanity is returning. My power is returning. I will be a man once again. A man without you, but there is no reason to be one with you. You aren't worth it. You never were. I was clouded by a euphoria of your greatness, a greatness that I won't lie, still remains. But your flaws stabbed me, continuously, not until I couldn't stand it anymore, but until I finally decided to give in and walk away. No conceivable reason for me to stay. I learned my limits, even when it came to something as great as love. But these limitations, I do not want to push against. I will accept I am no god, just a mortal man. That I know matter how much I can conqueror, I can't take every single thing head on. Today my love for you died, my heart skipped a beat for the last time. That beautiful warmth was killed, by you, and I am happy you did it, since it is something I have wanted to do for a while now. Today I can be truly happy."
2822,2015-03-24 12:04:16,"5327
The worst feeling is expecting to be disappointed but still feeling every bit of it. You know nothing has changed. You know the same actions will be taken, since it feels like they always are. But the smallest bit of you has hope, that maybe this time it will be different, and that hope meets your realism, causing  a pit of despair that no logic or emotions can climb you out of until you are proven right. Only then does the pit stop growing, and you can finally get out, just waiting for the next time to fall in. Waiting, foolishly, because that small bit of hope keeps you there, even though you know it shouldn't be."

I was going through an extremely difficult time during my first year here, and I feel like some of the people in my dorm just judged me and thought I was weird and had issues. This wouldn't irk me so much if these same people didn't act like they're concerned, liberal, open minded global citizens in their daily lives and not the judgmental jerks who were unfriendly and condescending toward someone who was visibly struggling. Yes, someone's depression or anxiety might be offputting for some, but I don't think it's ever killed someone to just be nice to people. I might have been deeply upset by hurt I felt at the time, but now that I've overcome the problems I was facing back then I just view these people as hypocritical pieces of ****. That is all."

""I made an account on Friendsy to see what the new app was like, and I (a male) was confused and overwhelmed by number of freshman and sophomore girls here at Cornell (over two dozen) who kept hinting that they wanted to be “friends” with me over the course of a week. I didn’t think it had anything to do with whether or not I’m attractive: I’m average looking, but I did indicate on my profile that I was gay. I removed any mention of my sexuality from my profile, and in the last week I haven’t had a single girl send me a hint that she wants to be my “friend.”

First, I want to say that I hope the following rant doesn’t apply to at least a few of those girls. 

But I am not anyone's “Gay Best Friend,” nor am I anyone’s “GBF.” I don’t want to go shopping with you, I don’t want to gossip about boys with you, I don’t want to teach you how to better accessorize. I’m not a stereotype: I don’t dress well, I don’t have a “gay” voice, most people don’t consider me “feminine.” That shouldn’t matter.

I’m not a box to check on your list of “friends;” I’m not an accessory, I’m not a trophy, I’m not a box to check on your list of “friends.” I’m not an object. 

I’m a human being. I’m also human being who just happens to be gay. And when I make friends, I don’t go out of my way to have a black friend, or an asian friend, or an international friend, or a smart friend, or a stupid friend, or a rich friend or a poor friend. I just want a friend.

I sincerely hope you do as well."""

""I felt completely naked discussing something that seemingly defines me, in one dimension, but regardless a large part of myself.

I try to distance myself from facing what it means to have the grades that I got. If I care too much about it, I know I will break. It'll snap me inside more than I can handle - I know that. I can feel the tears about to burst and stream down my cheeks as I am writing this...
I think it's because I either cared too much or didn't care at all. Never really in between. 

This weird in between feeling is irritating...
I feel like it's because I don't have a clear defined goal in mind. This is important, more than anything, because it'll eventually define what I learn, why I study, who I meet, what I value, and really...everything. But without this, I'm completely lost and powerless. I feel powerless. Worthless. Useless. 
I'm doing things that don't matter. That doesn't add any substance to me. But I do it anyways as a way to compensate for the empty feeling I get - academically and socially. Does this paint an accurate picture of myself? 

I haven't said anything. I haven't told anyone. I feel like I need to let someone know, because I don't think I can keep up with a straight face without someone knowing. I don't know how or who to reach out to...

I'm not a freshman. No. Wish I were actually. Maybe that would have changed things. If I were to have different experiences, joined greek organizations, tried out for a club sports, I don't know, reached out more...I know I have the potential, but now I've missed the opportunities. 

This is definitely not THE most worrisome issue. It's not going to kill me or anything. But when this started to define my boundaries, my mindset and eventually control my life, I felt like they were clear signs to reach out. I hope this isn't wasting anyone's time. Because that's essentially what everyone is out of. Time.   

I don't know why I felt compelled to justify all this. I don't know what I don't know or what I do know, as a matter of fact. 

Who do I confide in?? I don't want to pressure someone, but I don't want someone to think any less of me. or judge me based on that. Because I know I would."

""I hate reading posts on social media from students and alumni saying how much they love Cornell, and how they're going to miss it (or how they already do), how it was the best time of their life, and how being in the real world will/or already does suck, and blah blah blah. I hated Cornell. It was stressful, it was lonely, it was night upon night of never sleeping. Don't get me wrong, I had friends and I had moments where I said """"Fuck all"""" and had a relaxing moment or two, but I feel like I would have been so much happier had I transferred out. But I stayed and I graduated. Probably the only reason I didn't transfer was because finaid covered everything here, and I wouldn't have gotten such a great deal anywhere else.
And puh-lease. The real world is so easy, are you kidding me? My job pays the bills and then some (in a field unrelated to my education), I've got twice as many friends as I did in undergrad, and it's so great having free time again! I can finally spend time doing things I enjoy! (a tiny example: when was the last time you read a book for fun?) A great weight was lifted from my shoulders when I graduated.

Fuck Cornell and the unnecessary heaps of stress and ungodly workloads it places upon its students because of whatever bullshit it thinks it has to prove to the outside world."

I'd like to live long enough to see every fraternity and sorority in this country closed. No other environments come anywhere near Greek systems in terms of condoning bullying, alcohol abuse, sexual harassment and assault, and yes, racial stereotyping. The ugliest sides of humanity should not be tolerated at institutions that were purportedly established to educate. Administrations would do well to focus a little more on providing good opportunities for focused, interested students than on covering up for people who decide to treat their university like an alcoholic's summer camp."

It annoys me when they say, """"We need to be always trying to get ass, because if we don't get it, some lame kid will."""" That makes sense, but I don't like the party atmosphere. Back when I used to go out, I have memories of these girls who are mediocre to hit, acting high and mighty when I try to interact with them. I remember the guy being the life of the party(most vibrant and funny) getting the most attention but I don't like that style, it feels too try hard to me. So now I just avoid parties all together.

Also, the really attractive chicks don't go to parties, they have enough men in their life to take them on dates and events that the party scene can be avoided. I rather figure out a way to get these 'regular girls' to like me than the 'party girls'."""

""I have been really antisocial when I was a freshman. Yes I was that antisocial guy who never came out from his room. I constantly reminded myself that I was happy with everything in Cornell. To forget that I am not lonely, I intentionally made myself busy with everything that I really did not need to do. I feared going back to my dorm because I thought people living in my hallway would see me and end up back-talking. I woke up really early in the morning to take shower because I did not want to be seen by others even in the bathroom or kitchen. I stayed in the library late in the night (until when the Olin library closed), and I intentionally used other staircases so that people, at least people in my unit, cannot see me. I wanted them to forget that I am living in that room. When there was a party going outside the corridor and I could hear it, I just did nothing sitting in my room. I slept for 24hours, I did not eat anything. There was one rumor I overheard that years before one of the freshmen guys committed suicide in his room in the dorm I was living and no one noticed that for more than a month because he was so antisocial I even talked to myself. It was the smell of the rotten body that later made people know that he committed suicide. And I later thought: """"If I do the same thing, no one will notice me and I would be dead and unknown for 1 month like that person was.""""

I hope there are no one currently living in North Campus doing the same thing that I have done because the freshmen year in college was the most miserable year of my life. Please talk to someone, go find EARS, go talk to your parents, go talk to your advisor, anyone. Please talk to anyone. Talking brings a lot of change in your life. Please don't be me and spend your wonderful freshmen year like I have done."""

I got scorned at the other day for wearing a shirt of Che Guevara. It didn't bother me initially. It's just a shirt that I didn't think too much about when I purchased it back home and packed it into my luggage.  But as the day progressed I noticed that I received more unpleasant stares. But they got me thinking. It's funny that we're always told who our heroes are and who we should look up to. MLK, Ghandi, Mother Teresa, etc. They left out Che from the history books (or mentioned him briefly) because it went against the capitalist agenda.  But after long, intensive research of the person behind one of America's most marketed faces (oh, the irony on both sides), I realized that he was one of the greatest men of the 20th century and his cause was noble, as he stood up against the most powerful empire in the world. I don't regret pissing off those people. ¡Viva Che!"

We are not paid to be waiters. We are not paid to clean up after you.  If you want us to pick up your plates, we're happy to begin accepting tips. Reminder: appropriate amount is minimum 15%, but for your gum, it'd probably be better to go up to at least 20%."

Back in High School I felt like a total rock star. Despite being a kind of quiet guy, I was the epicenter of my friend group. People became friends because they were [first] friends with me. Everyone knew my name, and in terms of girls, it was usually just a matter of which one to turn down for the other. It was socializing time, all the time.  

Fast forward to Cornell: I can’t ever find time to hang out with the few friends I have, and I sometimes go days without seeing or talking to a human being at Cornell. My close high school friends are all at other colleges with countless friends and weekend plans, going about it with their significant others and fantastic grades. “It seems like you never have time for anything, Cornell sounds like a s**thole,” said one of those friends this past weekend. “You’re telling me to take a break from doing homework? That’s weird coming from the guy that hardly ever stops,” said another.

I just want to let you know that I miss being your friend. The last time we really hung out and actually interacted with each other to any significant degree, we were alone together for the first time and we had so much fun! We always got along so well despite how different we are, and I can honestly say that you're exactly the type of person that I came to Cornell to meet: someone that is as friendly as you are, someone that is totally unlike me, and above all, someone that's wildly more intelligent than I could ever hope to be. I can't be too specific about what we did or where we went because then you'll instantly know who I am and I think that you'd find this more strange and unexpected than flattering if you found out that I wrote this. But I still want to let you know my perspective - in case anyone's out there wondering, the only hint I'll give is that this hangout was a totally sober and platonic evening, and I'm a dude and she's a girl.

But that was a while ago, anyway. I still don't really know what changed or if this was even intentional, but I think that you started to avoid me after that night - it wasn't like you changed behavior overnight, but I didn't see you for a little while and the next few times I saw you, you had started acting differently around me. You stopped sitting near me in lecture unless there was at least one mutual friend between us, we stopped texting, and pretty soon it was like we had never met at all. I figured that you had thought it was a date or something and didn't want to lead me on, so I decided to let you have your space. And months later, when we were both a little buzzed (surrounded, of course, by mutual friends), you started talking to me a little again - but something just didn't seem right with you. It was a little subtle, but there was something very different in your tone of voice (it was noticeably bitter, which is unsettlingly different from your usual warm lightheartedness) and the subjects of conversation that you wanted to talk about were definitely a little... darker. You've changed a lot since we first met and especially over the last few months, and while I get that people change and that's a part of life, I'm worried that something happened to you or that there's something wrong that you're not telling me (or worse, not telling anybody else). But now I feel like I'm too distant of a friend to bring it up or that you'll think I'm simply judging you rather than trying to be a caring friend, and maybe it's possible that I'm just being a little paranoid and reading too much into things. I just hope that you're okay and that the brilliant, beautiful friend I miss is still in that crazy head somewhere, because the girl I see now seems like a shade of the one I knew.

I miss you, and I care about you, and I hope that you're going to be okay and that I'll get to witness your warm personality again sometime before we eventually graduate. I've started to move on to other friends because I feel like you don't want to be around me any more, and sadly it looks like I won't be getting to know you nearly as much as I'd like, no matter how many more classes we'll probably have together. I just wish I knew what happened and why you've changed so much, but I guess I'll never know - in a matter of years, we'll never see or hear from each other ever again. If you ever want to talk or be friends again, you know how to reach me. Otherwise, I guess that this is my last real goodbye to you. I only wish the best for you, and that hopefully someday we can be real friends again.

Goodbye."

I'm on a prolonged leave of absence from Cornell for mental health and grade issues. I haven't told my parents and can no longer depend on them for tuition money because they're about to get divorced and my dad's basically kicking my brothers and I out of his life to take care of the whore he cheated with. I've begun working and will do so for the next year and a half until I re-enroll. But credit-wise I have at least a year and a half's worth of tuition to pay. I've done the calculations and I won't have enough to pay for all of it. I don't know if Cornell will give me enough aid and even if they do, I know I'm going to feel really bad if I accept it since I'd be depriving some other well-deserving kid of an opportunity. I hate what I've become and how far I've fallen. I used to be a good student that showed some competence for engineering--12 AP's, high SAT's, decent GPA for two years in college. Far from a genius. But at least competent at learning. I'm so deep in this pit I've dug for myself. I'll never be able to take care of mom or rise high in society. To make it all worse, I just keep wondering...how did I ever let things get this bad?"

To all the people who reacted harshly to the kid judging tattoos and piercings - the reason it's silly is because it's voluntary permanent corporeal mutilation that you do to express yourself. Honestly, who's more insecure - someone who cares about what other people are doing with their bodies, or someone who mutilates their body to force a meaning to something they like or believe in. Get a poster. Get a t-shirt. How would you react if someone cut off their finger and said - I did this to honor my grandfather who died in World War II, or I did this to honor my favorite baseball team, or I did this because I think it reflects who I am. And then took offense at your judging her/him. Do whatever you want. We're just saying it's unnecessary and silly. There's a reason people who have serious jobs, who are role models for serious things, who have contributed to society in serious ways - Barack Obama, Steve Jobs, Albert Einstein, etc. don't have tattoos and piercings. It's a highly questionable choice, and you cannot take offense at being judged. That's part of the deal."

TW/CW: suicide/depression

I've been constantly missing morning classes/obligations due to an intense fear of recurring nightmares I've had ever since high school but have been returning more frequently lately

Every time I looked on that ledge a little too long, every time I cut a little (lot) too deep and every time I sat on the tracks watching trains pass all knight knowing I couldn't be seen and seriously (not a 'my life sucks right now understanding, but a mindset you come to after debating the same question in your mind for so long you know all the cracks and dominant paths the arguments will take) grappled with jumping in front of one.

Reliving it all only successful attempts. I don't think people understand how fucking hard it is to kill yourself. Even if you can take some action towards it, the instant before the 'final blow' you fall into the grip of this overwhelmingly sheer panic that subsumes everything else. Outside the dream thinking about the dream, I am always already before the panic but aware of it-- aware of this coming black wall of blind fear and deep anxiety. That's what I hate the most- always being before the panic is more unsettling than being in it because when you're in that place there is no other thoughts other than that claw in your stomach that you have to stop, run, hide, don't do that, put it down. In the dream, I'm already dead in a dozen different situations and places, wallowing in that void of panic

I hate/fear it so much. Every day I think I'm fine, but before I sleep that little slow pre-panic knot just unravels in my chest and I start sweating and get shaky. I can't go to sleep. I end up doing some (any) noncommittal task that will occupy me until morning- sometimes I just sit for 3-4 hours staring at the wall. Every other day or so this catches up with me- I'll stay up until I can't do it anymore and my body relaxes enough that I pass out (it's not like I don't have the same chance of having the dreams then- it's just that I can't stop myself from sleeping)

I don't know how to tell professors or friends or other people that I make arrangements with what's going in- why I'm always tired in class or missing them- why my sleep schedule is so erratic. I could go to a professional, but I'm poor as all hell and I can't risk family members finding out. I'm lost"

""Blacks are more racist than whites."" So I've heard. But here's where the argument fails. It's hard to discriminate on race if you are in the minority. If a minority is ""racist"", it is most likely linked to the fact that the racism from the majority has caused it. But even then, if a minority is ""racist"", WHO GIVES A FUCK? He or she is generally not in a position to use their racism to OPPRESS. Notice the difference? It's not like these same black men and women you accuse of being racist can use their racial positions to hold other races down or skew the system to their favor. That's the problem with the ""reverse racism"" argument.

[Admin: Even if there isn't an opportunity to oppress, racism still hurts. One awful comment or one little stereotype can cause so, so much harm to a person's psyche]"

During Spring of 2014, I used to sit in a circular table along with several girls and 1 guy. Every time the guy would arrive to class, I would get silent. I wouldn't even want to ask the TA for help because I didn't want him to hear my voice. I would just hide my paper and look at it and hope class would be over. I had trouble with the problem sets but his presence made my silent. 

It's not that I had a crush on him, but more so that I was scared of him. He seemed really manly. He reminded me of my past. I grew up in an abusive family. My dad and older brothers would beat me and sometimes use my hair to pick me up. They would call me a bitch all of the time. My dad would slap me if I had a boy friends or if I wore anything above my knees. I haven't had a conversation with my father and two older brothers since I was in elementary school and now I'm over 20 years old. 

I'm really sorry for being silent towards you last year. I would catch you glance towards my direction or maybe I was just being paranoid. You probably didn't notice it. It's something that I'm trying to fix. I hope one day, I won't feel so scared of men. I hope I can also share this story with my close friends. I hope I can also fix my relationship with my family."

Cornell made me realize how worthless I am. I am graduating in a couple of months with no job, I am more depressed than when I came into Cornell, and I feel like such a loser. I don't even have any friends since no one keeps any contact with me really. I am so worried that once I leave Ithaca when my lease expires I will be homeless. I don't even know what to do, my family laughs at me about how an ""Ivy League Grad"" can't find a job. Sometimes I just wish a bus would hit me or that I could just pass out when no one is here and end it. It's not like I matter anyways, I am really worthless since no employer to hire me, I have no friends, and I never even been on a date. I think if I just disappeared no one would even notice because I don't even make a single difference in anyone's life. Sometimes I feel as though I roam the earth unnoticed as if I was invisible."

I have friends and loneliness is not an issue partially because I am an extreme extrovert--an outlier of all sorts. However, there are times when I wonder how this nomadic sort of social lifestyle affects the extent/ depth of relationships I am able to have. I seem to float around and people in the outer circles of my social life perceive this as my being able to making friends so easily with so many people. I do have a base group from freshmen year that I feel at home with, who have always been there and who I truly love as family. I don't know if any non-extroverts would understand this but part of this characteristic means friend zoning literally every person I meet. Even if someone is nice looking or potentially someone I would date, I figure maintaining friendships would mean a longer relationship, which I prefer over a relationship that could potentially sour.. so yes I am friends with many, many people. I'm just wondering...is this an extrovert problem or is it just me?"

Is it terrible I always feel like I'll never amount to anything because my body can't keep up with the stress and burdens of long work hours? The moment I start to skip meals or sleep to keep up is the moment my body starts to crash. I was told that I honestly needed to rest for a few days and that is all it took to fall so far behind. I suppose it's just another one of those survival of the fittest things and I'm just lucky to be alive. I really envy the people who can wake up and work almost constantly. I hate being punished for my stupid failing body that won't listen to my willpower and ambitions. This semester was my final warning too."

I'm completely floored by the incompetence of all of the TA's and grad students at Cornell. Only one of the TA's I've had so far, across five departments, has been good. Just last week, in one Econ section, the PhD student / TA consistently mangled terms (referring to excise taxes as ""exercise"" taxes), couldn't solve a two-variable system of equations (in a class that requires multivariable calculus), and couldn't understand student questions. I can understand that some TA's have difficulty with English, and while this particular TA isn't a native English speaker, he or she studied economics as an undergraduate in America. Cornell clearly doesn't take grad students based on their ability to teach, but hoped at the very least that they'd at least be proficient in the fields that they study.

Does anyone else feel the same way? Or have I just been unlucky enough to get all of the bad TA's?"

My girlfriend defines hypocrisy. After a 2 years of dating, she finds it okay to spend 70% of the day with a guy who's crazy about her and makes no attempt to hide it. Its annoying that she has every meal of the weak with him, and I'm invited (mostly as an obligation) and treated like a third-wheel. Me, I'm not allowed to text another girl without being called a dick and being ignored for a week. I get the whole being even thing doesn't apply to a relationship, but I'm pretty sure one-way bitchiness calls for some kinda revenge right?"

I lost one of my best friends that I ever had here at Cornell. She didn't die or any of that stuff. I alienated her. I got so caught up in doing extracurricular work and took on to many of those responsibilities and I couldn't handle the stress. That excess stress went to her and I basically yelled at her and called her filthy names whenever she made fun of my bad sleeping habits or any of my personal details(although it's due to the fact I'd been an addicted to pills after I saw one of my friends pass away in high school and I've been clean for 5 years, but the stress is making me revert back to eccentric patterns and behavior. The irony is that I used to do journalism and extracurricular work in high school as a way to take my mind off my friend, but now it's just working against me). I don't wanna tell my friend these things because I don't want her to be scared of me and what I am capable of doing in terms of hurting myself. Of course,this plan backfired as it resulted in her not knowing me at all and I take on the apparition of an ass-wipe. It also backfired on me because I don't make many friends out of the fear of losing them, as I did my closer friend in high school.

Even worse, I'm also ""unsupportive"" of her ambitions, but I really don't feel that way. I'm glad you got the stuff you wanted and you're in a good place. But I also feel that she can do better, and she thinks that invalidates my previous compliment.

Now, she doesn't want anything really to do with me, and I feel lonely because I alienated everyone to the point I have nobody if she's not there.

I get it. I'm a shitty friend. and I'll gladly admit that. But what I'm worried about are the steps I need to take to be the best friend one could possibly ask for, because I'm ready to change. I know it's too late to be there for her and she being happy about it, but I'm sure I can do something differently as to not repeat history.

So, guys.... what are your suggestions?"

Sometimes, after breaking up you need just to forget everything. You keep yourself busy trying to distract yourself from thinking of her. But as soon as you fall asleep, a fascinating romantic movie starts in your dream. You have a wonderful date with her, you go to a restaurant, chat and laugh. You dance together with an awesome song, you make love with her. Lots of enchanting memories.

i feel like the white people here get really touchy when people talk to them about privilege or about how racist institutions still hurt people of color to this day. it seems like its a massive fight just to get people to realize that racism is still a problem and that yes, they personally are contributing to it by supporting systems of racial power either tacitly or overtly. instead, white people take any sort of attempt to confront or educate them on this as an unfair attack on them, they think theyre the ones being discriminated against and they throw around terms like politically correct and social justice warrior to delegitimize any criticism. So fuck it. I give up. I reject Dr. King's dream. I no longer give a shit about racial harmony, i just want whats mine, cuz we've had 400 years to work this getting along shit out and its clearly not working. so im just gonna work hard and get whatever money and power i can take because guess what white america? I dont need you to like me, at this point i don't even want you to like me. everything you have you built on the backs of exploited people of color and bitch i want whats mine and im taking it by any means necessary."

I met this girl in one of my classes this semester and I really like her. But  the thing is, I have a girlfriend who I love and want to marry. We're very honest with each other, and I would never cheat on her because the guilt would kill me and probably ruin our relationship. And I love our relationship.

I know the other girl is just a crush, and that I probably only like her because shes new and fun, but I cant stop thinking about her. I cant tell my girlfriend or anyone else my thoughts because I know it would hurt her too much to know I even looked at another girl.

I'm so happy to have found the love of my life, but sometimes I wish I found her a bit later so I'd have time to play the field. And I worry I'm limiting my experiences. The worst thing is I think she likes me too. I almost wish she didn't, but I'm happy she is.

Any advice would be welcome. I have no intention of acting on it but maybe I should."

I am a freshman and I girl. I had an absolutely terrible first semester at Cornell, and I don't know where I would be if I didn't join a sorority. I know a lot of people bash on them, but I don't know where I would be if I didn't have a support system this semester. I know there are a lot of negative aspects associated with sororities, but they aren't as bad as one would think. It has been the best choice I have made since coming to Cornell. Cornell is a stressful place, and if you don't feel like you have a support system, it's hard."

I met this girl during the summer and never really had interest in her but as I learned more about her and grew fond of her I really peaked interest in her. We have grown apart a bit this past semester and now I am pretty sure she doesn't feel the same way about me. I could tell her anything, but I just don't think she sees me the same.

After this housing bullshit, I've honestly started to wonder why I chose to go to Cornell. My parents pay 60k a year for an Ivy League education (You would think that the administrators would be intelligent enough to actually figure out how to fucking do math (In case you haven't: [total (non shitty) beds - (current students  + transfer students) >> 0) and for everything that a ""first degree"" institution would offer, but apparently I'm paying for a shitty sophomore year.

Two words that I use to describe Cornell is inferiority complex. I honestly hate how we constantly compare ourselves to other universities, universities that we can easily agree are some of the best universities in the world (Harvard, Princeton, Columbia). On social media I constantly see people saying things like ""safety school"", or that other schools are easy and have joke workloads. I have friends that go to all of these schools, and they DO NOT GIVE A SHIT ABOUT US. Nowhere around Harvard do people say ""safety school"" or ""fuck Cornell they're an easy school."" This is embarrassing. If we are gonna have rival schools, fine, I'm all about school spirit, but when it comes to insulting the academic level of another elite institution, just stop."

I used to love this school. Even when things started to get hard and my GPA took a bit of a dip sophomore year, I still argued that I loved the place because I really felt a sense of community with the people here. Now I'm in my junior year and I just can't bring myself to even think ""I love Cornell"" anymore. I just feel so beaten and battered, and, as much as I love my friends, part of me wants to quit and give up. I just don't know what I want to do with my life, so it feels like all of this insane hard work I do in the engineering school is pointless. It feels like Cornell has just completely drained me."

To confession #5122 and the first commenter: 

I strongly encourage you to seek out help. I'm sure you already know about CAPS and EARS, and I cannot stress enough how much those have helped me and thousands of other students on this campus. I struggled with many of the same issues for much of my time here and it took me a long time to realize that I needed help; Cornell wasn't the sole source of my problems, and my depression was really distorting my image of what is, despite its faults and shortcomings, an amazing institution."

I get really sad when I think about how every time I talk to my mom, it's never about, or never can be about my feelings, or emotions in general. It's always about ""progress"" or whether I'm doing A, B, and C here at Cornell to get to points D, E, F, etc... the ""right way"".  If I don't answer her questions the way she wants them to be answered I get shamed for it. One of the things I dread most is going home for breaks because I have to live inside the little cardboard box that is the four walls inside my head.  I tremble and shake in disgust and fear in my own home. 
Never mind being creative, never mind having a heart and soul along with this brain of mine. All of these are moot points for her--that's even an understatement.

If I am not hitting the gym everyday at precisely 8am, skipped a session in the pool, or had to change up the way I do things-or sometimes sacrifice things like sleep and exercise for my schoolwork and work responsibilities, I get shamed for it. I get held to ridiculous standards, get ugly looks and comments in place of supportive, understanding smiles or hugs.  
I can only be so self-absorbed and selfish as to spend all of my time thinking about the ""right ways"" and about me me me and how I'm supposed to have the mentality that I'm the best thing to roam the earth and that I should pursue nothing but what will be most ""socially acceptable"": the best paying job, the most good looking man (of the ""correct race/ethnicity"" and social class"" according to her), and all of the ""guaranteed"" riches that are supposed to come from seeking these things.

Well I'd like to just say that I'm tired of this stranglehold being placed on my life. It hasn't ever been my own, but I'm ready to take complete and full ownership of it now. It has taken me a little over two full years at Cornell to realize this. I am so happy with where I've come so far--paving my life as my own. I'm so happy with my new major and my mission to continue my education and hopefully land a decent job and spread some good knowledge--at any university in the future. I'm so happy with who I am in a relationship with currently-someone who, while he may not fit the ""standards"" she has set, goes above and beyond any prior expectation I've had of a significant other-someone I can see myself being with a few years down the road- circumstances willing-someone who does value me for exactly what I want and will care for me if I need to be taken care of. 

But nothing, absolutely nothing I say or do can convince her that my life is headed in the right direction. 

I shouldn't feel at all guilty for wanting to distance myself, right? Can someone please verify that the very person who raised me is ultimate provider of toxicity in my life? 
Can someone please tell me that it's okay to feel this way and that I have a right to live my own way without carrying the weight of ""disappointing or abandoning"" her on my shoulders every day? 
I just need some reassurance-the kind I'm not used to getting."

So... I am here to confess something.

Just wanted to share the fact that I recently joined a fraternity and say that there aren't as ""bad"" as stereotypes show. Now that I am in the Greek system, I want to share what I have seen so far and what I recommend.

1. You can be of any race and culture. Any frat would gladly accept you for who you are. Something I have noticed (and maintained) is that being yourself during rush events will help a lot when brothers are deciding on whether to offer you a bid or not. Many students try to impress frat members but that doesn't really help. Be yourself.

2. You don't have to be rich to join one. I am not rich at all and joined one. As long as you can keep up with the fees (usually in the semester you become a brother you only pay for the new member fees and don't pay a dime until the following semester), you will be okay. If you have financial concerns, state that to other brothers as a reason why you'd not join one; they will help if they want you.

3. Lastly, most frats are not always about parties. Of course, they do have social times and everything, but if your parents are concerned about you partying too much, explain to them how do you feel about the frat you want to become a brother at. I did have issues with my parents, but I explained to them that a particular frat is not about partying, it's about brotherhood. If that still doesn't work, ask an active member to talk to your parents. I am sure they will understand. 

I know not everyone will agree with me but these are my perceptions so far. I became an active brother last weekend and I can tell is by far one of the best decisions I have ever made."
3013,2015-03-09 17:12:36,"5136
You're beautiful. You don't strive for mainstream appearances, and I know there's not much you care about less than being beautiful, but you are anyway. Everything you do proves that you are separate from the standards set by others, but it just makes you more attractive to me. Keep it up, girl. Never change."
3014,2015-03-09 17:49:38,"5135
I wish I could just live in a massive underground bunker with all the supplies necessary and all the amenities I could possibly dream of, and nobody would know. That way I could never be bothered by anyone. I would feel so much happier."

Dear premeds, you guys are SO hardworking and intelligent! And many of you are very caring, despite all of the difficult curves and sleepless nights you put into your grades. Big shout out to Cornell premeds."
3016,2015-03-09 17:43:40,"5133
I started to fall in love with my best friend here. Over the past few months, every guy she talked about and every complaint about her relationships have been eating away at me. I knew she had a lot of stuff on her plate, but I had to tell her anyway. I told her I loved her and what I think she deserves in a relationship. I now know that in the end, we will only remain friends, but I hope she took what I said to heart. Any guy on this planet would be lucky to be with her.  I have never been in a relationship or been with a girl, but I know what love is about. Its about respect and I respect whatever she wants, even though it is not me."
3017,2015-03-09 17:21:41,"5132
I long to find another introvert who has no problem rubbing my hands as we lay next to each other in silence. I want someone I can read novels with, share our favorite quotes, drink wine, bob our heads to our favorite tunes. I want to dive right into someone else's world with them. I want our worlds to mesh and collide in a gentle, forgiving way. 

The problem is I know how to love all too well."

Whenever I try to start my homework, I think to myself, why should I?

To get it out of the way to practice my hobbies? I don't have any.

To get a good grade in the class? Why should I care?

To get a good job? To make money? That's all worthless to me. The only thing I want to do in my life is matter to as many people as possible. I'm not even sure if I like my major, let alone the jobs that I could get out of it. At this rate, I doubt I'll get a job where I'll matter to anyone.

I don't know what I'm doing here at Cornell. I don't think I've gotten much out of it so far, and it has only given me deep-rooted mental problems."

I fucking hate this place. I don't much care for the people, the place, or anything else in particular. It doesn't really matter anymore because I'm a junior now and have only a year left. I didn't want to transfer earlier because this a pretty good engineering school or whatever. I figured if a suffered through it for 4 years, at least I'll have an engineering degree from one of the best schools in the country. But I've realized that everything is futile. All of it. I mean what's the point of all this? I get a job and I'll be a 21 yr old just making money with no purpose. I'm working hard now to work harder later. I still work hard and do well in school but deep down I know that all this is pointless. Oh well, none of this matters. I'll put a bullet through my head soon enough (maybe when I'm 25 or so). I've pretty much made up mind about this so no one can convince me otherwise."

I think you and I would be such a power couple.

You're incredibly smart, talented, and I really don't know what you can't do (seriously!)
It's also been such a long time since I've met somebody who could make me laugh so hard besides my girlfriends.
I love that you're so ambitious and that you can play hard to get...it just makes every sweet little thing you do or say mean so much more to me!

But of course...nothing's perfect.

It's really a shame...and I hate that it bothers me so much deep inside and I really, really try to not let it bother me.
Growing up my parents always told me that Christianity and good faith came first in a relationship. Now that I'm older and my family is starting to accept that I'll be dating more seriously...they're pushing it on me more than ever.
I can understand why and I owe so much to my family. Family is really important to me! But I just feel so conflicted using ""faith"" as criteria when I think about dating.

I love God and it would only be a plus if you were also a firm-believer, but I love you so much anyway.
and I know you love me back. Isn't that all that matters?"
3040,2015-03-09 00:05:29,"5109
Fuck you, and you and you and you, too. You guys suck. You're grown men... why are you taking sides like middle school girls??? Jeez, and here I thought guys didn't have drama in their friendships... 

But at the end of the day, no matter how hard you try to mess up my life and throw me off, I'm going to get over it and keep doing what I want to do, so your loss. :/"

As an international, it is 90% of my stress to receive no financial aid whatsoever, especially when my parents stay ambiguous on whether they can/want to afford it, keep telling me to consider alternatives to save money, while at the same time want me to not stress over it. Well I am, and if there is no significant amount of grant I can get to alleviate this, I might as well just withdraw and give up all my dreams."

My parents have always appeared to be very 'liberal' about what I do. But in fact i can feel their expectations. When I talked to them about what really fascinates me -music, art, literature, philosophy, they would dismissively say that you can't count on those things don't make a living. I'm getting a degree in Econ, as they wanted, but all I really want to is to be a writer, to travel around the world, to get the most of this life. And all the comparison to the others Sometimes I wonder if they just don't want to lose the reputation as the well-doing ones in the family. Maybe I'm just a dumb romantic but I think life ought to have more than material pleasure."

A lot of confessions here are in the following format: ""To the girl/boy with such wonderful physical appearance, you are so cute, let's be friends!”. I'd like just to argue that maybe an anonymous message is not the best way to impress someone and grab his/her attention! Maybe you need to be self confident and start a conversation unanonymously yourself. Quoting from the Gran Torino movie:
“I know I'm not always the most pleasant person to be around, but I got the greatest woman who ever lived to marry me. I had to work at it, but I got her and it was the best thing that ever happened to me. Hands down""."

My lowest point so far just might be talking on the phone with my mom about not feeling good enough to be here and sobbing disgustingly whenever she says something encouraging while stuffing a pecan roll into my mouth because I haven't eaten all day, all while hiding in an empty classroom hoping nobody comes in and sees how gross this whole scene actually is. 

I feel a little better though, so there's that."

Falling in love is no doubt an absolutely beautiful feeling. But i guess everything has two different sides. While I do embrace the love I feel for my boyfriend, and I do feel I am a lucky girl for having him in my life,  it also scares me. Being in love makes me feel so vulnerable.. so susceptible of being hurt and broken down. I used to be so strong on my own but now I feel like if something happened between us, my world would come crashing down, and that idea does worry me. The future is just so unclear and I'm scared about what might come."

Hi there.  

It's hard for me to say those words to you in real life.  It's been a year now and although I'm not completely over you, I've seen other guys who've hurt me/I've hurt and I think I'm ready to be friends with you.  But I don't know if you want me in your life at all since you're the one who broke it all off, albeit only after a hell of a lot of crazy.  You stuck around a long time all things considered.  When we weren't being crazy--which was usually, actually--we were on the exact same wavelength.  We thought the same stupid things were funny.  We had an easy banter--from day one in fact.  And I miss that, even without any of the romantic strings attached.

And lately I've seen you around a lot for various reasons and you've been...well, you've stopped acting like I was a complete stranger.  Which could just mean that my company just means nothing to you in any form anymore.

I want to reach out to you.  Try to become friends again.  But I'm not going to.  I practically smothered you last time, and I don't want you to feel awkward or obligated to do anything.  And if you do read this and realize that it's me, just pretend like you never saw this if you don't want anything to do with me.  Let me live in disbelief that you may someday decide you want to talk to me again.  But if you do want to talk to me...let me know.

I just think back to winter break last year, and the texts we sent.  They could've been just between friends, and I was happy with just that.  Can we go back to that?

(P.S. my life really isn't that shitty right now.  I'm in a good place and this isn't me being depressing and bemoaning the fact that my life is over without you--it isn't.)"

I want a friend so badly that the fact I don't have one is killing me. I think the reason I really want a friend because it will be statement for me and everyone else I know, that Im """"want-able"""". That I'm not a loser. But until that happens I can only see myself as unwant-able. I wish I didn't care so much what ppl thought, but I do, and it kills me. 
This effect of lack of friendships is getting worse, because every new start ends the same crappy way - friendless. So I don't see how it could get better. 
It's getting so bad that I serious can't sit down to do work because I don't have friends and therefore am super depressed and can only think about the fact I don't have friends and Im super depressed... 
This is a new ending spiral downhill... (Or as they would say here in ithaca, a never ending snowball downhill...)"

I want to tell my frat bros, but I'm afraid they'll laugh at me. I tried telling my dad, but he threatened to cut off my tuition payments if I keep watching it and that was the end of the conversation. I can't help getting a boner every time I see a clown or hear one laughing in a circus, cartoon, wherever whenever. 

You know what? Fuck it. I'm hitting up EARS and getting myself checked out by a therapist. I can't handle this shit anymore. Fuck clowns."

One of the most important things I've learned at Cornell (or in college in general) so far is that friends are not always the best people to live with. Although you might be okay with living in pigsty conditions, I am not. I can't wait for this semester to be over because asking you to be cleaner has been like asking a brick wall to move aside."
3088,2015-03-04 08:54:59,"5061

Sometimes I feel that I MUST be broken, ""out of alignment"" or my sights are inherently flawed. I find that every woman I find date worthy or genuinely interesting at Cornell always falls into these two categories. #1: ""I have a boyfriend"" or #2: ""I just broke up with my boyfriend and I'm still not over him."" I have yet to find someone who falls into third category #3: ""Yes, I'm single and I'd like to get to know you more"". 

Am I looking in all the wrong places? Am I being too impatient? Are my standards to high? Am I too ""nice""? Am I simply not good enough? Am I being lied to? I don't know the answers to these questions, but I do know this: being single when you're trying not to simply sucks."

My significant other and I are grateful for our job offers in our respective fields that are waiting for us after graduation. But what sucks is that they are on opposite ends of the country.

As a senior, I'm a little sad that I've started to drift away from my fraternity brothers. They've been, and still are, some of my closest friends at Cornell. At the same time, it's kinda relieving too. The new leadership is questionable, with our rush chair bring a sophomore with almost no experience and our leaders making questionable decisions. The brothers are getting apathetic, and the events just aren't fun anymore. Maybe it's just me, or maybe it's senior year, but I just don't feel that connection anymore."
3092,2015-03-04 07:19:16,"5057

I can't tell if you know or not. The mixed signals I get from you push me away even more. I want to give up on the possibility of us, but it's hard because we've already come so far since last year....and to give all that away is heartbreaking. Sometimes I know that you try but I don't know what your real intentions are. Are you actually interested or are you just being nice/friendly? Seeing you laughing and chatting with your friends made me realize that I'm not special. You don't only joke around with me and you go out of your way to help everyone out...not just me. I was reading too much into it before. I would be honest with you but if you don't feel the same way, we will lose even the possibility of being friends and that's too big of a risk. At the same time I feel like we are just wasting time and just moving back and forth without going anywhere."

That awkward moment when you realize the girl you're in love with is sleeping with a mutual friend. Shit. She's too beautiful, kind, funny, intelligent and spectacular for him. She is outgoing and has an infectious personality. Why is she sleeping with him? I could be so much more for her. It sucks balls when people are oblivious."
3095,2015-03-04 07:42:20,"5054

I've never missed anyone so much as I miss my sister. She means everything to me, and I am so sad that I can only see her during holiday breaks.  I'd do anything to see her right now."
3096,2015-03-04 07:18:21,"5053

I hate it when my social worth to others is evaluated by how much potential utility I become to them. I despise doing that to others too because I like them as who they are. I know I will get snubbed at for claiming that humans have intrinsic values that cannot be measured by any standards. Even if it's true, does it even matter in an environment or a society driven and evaluated by extrinsic success? Success accessed by parameters such as GPA, wealth, number of friends, etc."
3097,2015-03-04 07:59:22,"5052

It is so sad how emotions between platonic friends could shatter the friendship. We were so close last semester, I would tell you everything, my hopes, my fears, my secrets, and you you would do the same. The thing is, I was in a relationship and you weren't. But because of emotions that started to arise, we both made mistakes that destroyed our friendship. I tried saving the friendship this semester, but I'm coming to the realization that the friendship we shared can never be the same. Every time I see you I am reminded of memories that I am trying to remove from my mind. How i wish I could go back in time to when me and you were just close platonic friends."

I know that people think it's acceptable and maybe even expected to drink alcohol, despite being underage, but it makes me really uncomfortable. I was offered alcohol once by an adult when I was clearly underage, and I now hate being offered it. I keep refusing friends, but they think it's just one big joke, despite explicitly telling them that it makes me uncomfortable, so I've stopped talking to them. Some of them even got defensive (that makes me groan; if you're feeling defensive about this, then you probably did it at some point, just accept it and move on, don't justify it). So yeah, I know the whole ""morality is subjective"" crap gets pulled out as some profound argument that makes people put their chins into their hands and agree, especially with things like drinking, but maybe you should actually care about people's feelings instead of just acting based on a philosophy you think makes you sound thoughtful, or keeps you in a cushioned safe bubble where you don't have to worry about upsetting people. If you can't tailor an argument to a specific situation instead of using almost the same generic words every time, then you don't sound clever. People even think that my problem is funny, and it's not. I now don't ever want to try alcohol. I hope you're happy."

All it took was a click of a button and now you're a ghost to me. It was clear that we were getting nowhere and it's probably childish to think that a bent rod can be perfectly reset. I'll miss you and I regret it already, but what's done is reality."
3102,2015-03-03 16:56:35,"5047
My friends are so boring. I love them and stuff, but sometimes I feel like I made the wrong decisions in being friends with them. It's our senior year, and all they want to do is sit at home and watch movies on Saturday night. It's annoying, like let's actually go out and have fun. I don't want to graduate and regret that I didn't have enough fun as an undergrad, but they're making it difficult."

Demotivated, probably depressed, probably borderline suicidal. Stuck in a rut where lethargy means I can't get out of bed or pay attention when in class, poor grades mean I'm even more dejected. In addition to all this my personal life is in shambles. I know I need help but I'm too afraid to seek it."
3105,2015-03-03 16:44:39,"5044
Sometimes I remember that I'm going to be that one AEM major who won't graduate with a job. I'm horrible horrible at cover letters and interviews (and I'm abroad so I can't get help from Career Services) and I'm struggling so hard to find a good internship.

Even if I get one, though, I know that I have zero motivation to succeed or do well. I'm just trying to fucking get by, figure out how to live with depression, and stop wanting to kill myself. I won't do well at an internship. I won't do well at a job. I won't do well at life.

I am a failure."

Exceptionally handsome and talented, built, sailing,  (Asian or part Asian?) theatre man...yes you're all of those things and you clearly seem to be an extremely genuine and kind person. The poise and devotion you portray on stage gives me chills. I'm sure there are many, many females that admire you out there..but this is just me appreciating that you seem like a phenomenal person in general. I hope you make whoever you end up being with a very, very happy person because they are going to be so lucky to have you by their side."

I'm an Asian 5'10'' girl. People tell me that I have a resting bitch face and I'm too tall. That's why guys avoid me. I genuinely think there are lots more interesting things about me other than my appearance. So, if you are really intimidated by it, #sorrynotsorry."

I thought you were in love with me too and that you would go every night where we met as I did up until now. Where are you? Please show up, please surprise me. I would be happy even if you told me you are gay and by no means you can be attracted to me. But please show up again before you graduate! probably if you didn't come back it's because you don't care. I should give up hoping, but it's so hard!"

I really thought this semester would be ok. I had some friends that I actually liked, a manageable course load and i got a fake. Then all my friends wound up in different houses for rush and I never see them anymore. I thought that we would still hang out, but now when we do, its all they can talk about because its all they really have time for. We just used to casually hang out and drink but now it just feels like they pencil me in between events out of some obligation. I would try and branch out more but I really don't know how to. My classes are at too weird times for most clubs and I find it really hard to meet people in my classes. Even if I'm not opposed to hook ups, there's not a big enough reason to go to bars without them anyway. I just wish I had some social outlet other than drinking at this point. I'm usually pretty happy alone between my research, my work and movies, but lately I'm just too lonely to not have anything else."

As a second semester senior, I wonder if it's worth pursuing anyone if I'm not seriously interested and I'm ready to move on to the next stage of life after Cornell...I want to have fun but don't want to be selfish or hurt anyone's feelings in the process..."
3119,2015-03-02 11:14:11,"5030

I try to do work, but I can't get you out of my damn mind! I've LITERALLY spent all day just looking at your pictures and posts on social media and rereading your cute texts you've sent me. I've already imagined our first date, wedding day, and our whole life together. Hell I'm writing about you in a confession because I want to document this if we ever do get married.
Is it normal to be so obsessed with someone that you put off all homework and commitments just to think about them? 
Worst part is I know you'd never like me back! You're fucking gorgeous and I'm just a Jewish boy with confidence issues. I don't even blame you for not liking me. I might sound pathetic, but I just want you to be mine so badly. Is this true love or just an unhealthy infatuation?"
3120,2015-03-02 11:40:13,"5029

I hate my body when I'm near people. When I look into the mirror I feel fine. When I can't see myself, I feel amazing. But when I go party and see myself in pictures with my friends, I feel huge. I wish I could just look like my friends but at the same time I know that my weight has made me who I am and I love who I am. So I both hate and love my body, and I'm perfectly okay with that. :)"
3121,2015-03-02 11:25:15,"5028

One thing I learned during my nearly four years at this college is that friendship, while it certainly is important, is overrated, and this realisation has made family seem so much more important."

I'm over thinking it's awkward to smile at random people while walking around. I'll be smiling, and if you're comfortable, I hope you start smiling at others too."
3125,2015-03-02 11:14:20,"5024

I've had just a shitty year and it's spilling over to this year as well. So many things have happened to me and they've turned me completely cynical and sad and negative and my friends pretty much expect me to just get over it like it's not important.

I know I shouldn't wallow in my misery, and I try really hard to move on and focus on the future, but every time sadness hits and I try to talk it out with a friend or someone they just give me pitiful looks and act like I'm a drama queen and like whatever I'm feeling is not important.

I just wish my ""friends"" appreciated me for who I am and realized that I can't be happy all the time. I'm sorry I have feelings and I'm sorry I confide in you."
3126,2015-03-02 11:57:21,"5023

What I really wanted to say was ""ditch your bed and come sleep with me.""

I am really tired of people hating on the fact that I believe in God. I shouldn't have to feel like I have to hide my faith because (some) others will judge. Not all of us are crazy, and some of us are really casual about it. 
I'm thankful to be able to at least once a week to be in a place I feel I belong. :)"
3128,2015-03-02 11:20:25,"5021

I told my friend that I super depressed, and the only response I got was its the weather... But when I tried to explain its been going on for a while, I got no response. This tells me one thing - she ain't no friend... However, I really want a friend."

I don't get it.  Every weekend I go to parties with my friends and while they're off having fun and hooking up with guys, i'm just standing there and thinking to myself ""i would not want to hook up with a single one of these guys."" I don't get the hookup culture.  Maybe it's just me, but I feel gross after I hook up with someone I don't know, and I don't understand people who begin relationships with hook ups and then start dating that person.  Maybe i'm old fashioned, but I do want to hook up with someone who I don't have feelings for, and I don't have feelings for someone just because they're attractive. I really want to find someone who can make me laugh, and who can be there for me when I cry.  But I don't want to find him by getting trashed and hooking up at a party. Isn't there more to life than that?"

""Humans are so fragile. We're so vulnerable and insecure; so uncertain and shaky in our emotions. To deny this or to act against it is to alienate ourselves from our human nature.

I need you. I'm so fucking vulnerable to you, and I'm not afraid of admitting it."""

To the boy who just broke my heart last night, I never tell you I have feelings for you from last semester, but that fact does not matter anymore. I can't stop thinking about you and what happened between us, I seriously think we are meant for each other. However, I understand what you said. If this is your decision, I will respect it. It's just I need some times right now to adjust what happened. Goodbye my lover, goodbye."

I don't understand why I can't make friends but I think I'm just going to have to settle with the fact that I must be socially akward. Since break seven people have dropped me as a friend on snapchat.... Snapchat!!! Like am I really such a bad person/friend that u drop me on snapchat!?!?!"
3134,2015-03-01 17:10:38,"5016

I feel like everything that isn't academic related at this school involves significant amounts of social climbing. Like if you don't want to be a social outsider, then you pretty much need to rush a Greek organization. The clubs are bad too-- most of them either don't do anything, or do, but require social climbing. The Daily Sun is a good example. 

What's worse, I've realized, is that this is probably reflective of the real world."
3135,2015-03-01 17:53:39,"5015

I think you're the most adorable thing on this campus. We were on the same study group last semester, and I could never not act awkwardly around you. You simply messed up my chemistry. I see you way more than I wish I did, I would have liked to forget about you. I'm pretty sure you have a girlfriend. And when I see you, you're always with the prettiest girls. 
When our gazes meet and you give me an acknowledging smile though... I've never seen anything as beautiful. I can't help but spend the following half an hour melted, dumb, enchanted. I really wish I could be close to you."

My long term ex-boyfriend broke up with me a few months ago and I honestly felt like everything was crashing down around me. I was already suffering through depression and it was only exacerbated by the break-up. I experienced suicidal thoughts for the first time in life. I spent hours in bed crying and staring at my window. I went to EARs and I confided in my friends and I went to the gym but I still felt incredibly empty. If any of you have ever gone through a painful experience, then you probably know what I am describing. It is a numbing pain that will not leave, even if you do all the right things. But now, a few months later, I feel so happy and excited about life. I never thought I would get here. I was prepared for the worst semester of my life but I just feel so happy about where I am in life. I see so many depressing posts on Cornell Confessions and on Yik Yak and I wish I could take away their pain. Whatever you are going through, please remember that there is light at the end of the tunnel. Please remember that there are people willing to listen and there are people who care about you."

I want to transfer. I'm not getting the """"college is the best years of your life"""" here, which sucks because Cornell is such a good school. In fact, I look forward to breaks just so I can go home. I just don't want to disappoint my parents because they are so happy that I'm at such a good school and want me to stay here. They are so supportive of me which makes it even worse because I don't want to disappoint them. What should I do?"

""Today is self-injury awareness day. For the past few years I've wanted to show my support by wearing an orange ribbon but I've always been too intimidated. I've even thought about just wearing a t-shirt and trying to ignore my scars.

I don't have the self-assurance to wear a t-shirt anymore, but to everyone else out there struggling just know that there are people out there thinking about you and who know what you're going through.

Recently, I've noticed my erratic behavior. I seem to be annoyed by people in general. I've spent so much time alone(especially at Cornell) that I've gotten accustomed to being in my own world. I go out of my way to avoid people and especially people I know. I avoid going to the dining halls when there are a lot of people because I'm afraid someone will recognize me and would want to eat together. I never go to events I'm invited to by my friends. And I absolutely HATE group projects. Unfortunately, I'm in engineering and group work is such a large part of my classes. Senior year in my curriculum requires two courses(lab course & design course) that require a lot of group work and I don't know how I'm going to survive. (Btw, I'll be a senior next semester so this is me freaking out). I hate the presence of my roommate. Last semester, my roommate wasn't here so I lucked out and had a large single. This semester, however, I have a random roommate who just annoys me with his presence. He's a nice guy but the fact that he is always there (in my room) bothers me. I know this is not an appropriate way to behave but I can't help it that people piss me off. I guess Cornell conditioned me into a lone wolf. I wonder how I'll survive in the working world. (Any tips?) I just want to graduate already, get a job, and live with a cat. Why can't I fast forward to that part?"

I tried posting before but it didn't show up. I'm not sure why. Anyway the gist of it is that I miss you. I realize now that the reason I make a good boyfriend is because I'm deathly afraid of the single life. It's a cold, barren, cutthroat post-apocalyptic wasteland where none are loyal beyond themselves. The stress of being ""good enough"" for you is a large part of what caused the anxiety that caused our problems. I wish that I had done something about it sooner, because I still love you.

She turned to me and said ""I know I'm not supposed to do that"" as she swiped me in and I just smiled. I had been having a pretty awful week with prelims and work and social drama but that moment just made it so much better. Thank you so, so much. You reminded me how much good there is in the world."
3151,2015-03-01 10:13:15,"4999
I've always liked you but I've never told you. I put a wall against you and me because you were dating someone and I didn't want to come between you two. I said no to riding on your shoulders for slope day, to playing beer pong, to hanging out sometimes because you weren't mine. If I hang out with you too long, I realize the greatness about you and my feelings for you come back. I've never had a chance with you because you were in relationships from when I first met you to now. I watched you play your happy life from a distance, while also lightly liking others as well. Now that you're out of that last, you're into one of our other best friends. I wish I had  a chance."

3153,2015-03-01 10:01:17,"4997
I realized why I'm a decent or good boyfriend today. It's because whenever I'm single I have no idea what the fuck I'm doing. Do I go for it? How do I read the signs? So when I find a girl I really like I hold on and make sure there's no chance in hell of fucking it up. And because of all of the (perceived) rejection when I'm single I think there's no way I can be good enough, supportive enough, good enough in bed, whatever. And the stress of that is what eventually starts to tear at an otherwise perfect relationship. Love conquers all, but if you worry about it constantly and are always second-guessing yourself then what's the point? I just wish that I could eliminate that worry from my life, but after 7 years of being the nice guy cast aside, what can I realistically train myself to do differently? I want to be the best version of myself and not be worried. I want it for me, but I find myself wanting it for her even, which just adds to the pressure."

I didn't expect anyone to be in the bathroom, but when I opened up the stall, there was a guy taking a shit there. Not only was I surprised that he didn't lock the door, but he was so surprised to have me walk in on him that he stood up and flashed his dick. There was an awkward pause between us and he said ""Oh sorry"" with no expression and sat back down. I turned around and immediately left. I didn't even take a shit there."

The thing is, I see myself getting attached to you already. I know this is casual and I keep telling myself that it'll be nothing more than what it is now. I've been so hurt before that I feel numb on the interior. Yet I can't help but show my infectious need to love. I know I deserve this more than ever now but just the idea of attachment pushes me back. I don't know if I'd rather enjoy momentary bliss and conceal my powerless emotions towards you or jump.

""Temporary."" I have never heard such a striking word that made me feel both terrified and relieved at the same time. A voice in my head repeats this word over and over until I start questioning if any sort of connection between two beings could last forever. I just beg for moments where I feel completely at ease and when I'm lying next to you or when you push me closer towards you and touch my lips, I feel just that. I can't walk away when it's real but there's nothing that compels me to speak of this because we're just friends and nothing more, right?"

During my senior year of high school, my dad told me he wanted me to write a screenplay of a movie idea he came up with.  We were in the car on our way back to my boarding school and he was telling me about the plot, but I wasn't really paying attention.  I had other things on my mind.  

Anyway, a couple months ago I gave up on a bunch of other things in my life and decided to write that screenplay just to take my mind off of everything.  I'd call home to talk to my dad about it and he would go on for a couple hours.  This would happen once or twice a week.  Anyway, he died last month and I'm stuck on one of the minor character details and I've been calling his cell phone every now and then to talk to him, even though I know he won't pick up.  It's just nice to hear his voice as I write."

In the morning I when I am coming to Cornell I usually see cheerful students getting on the bus talking about their wonderful lives full of joys and excitements and parties and blah blah. In the evening I read this page and I see mostly depressed students confessing about their awfully unpleasant lives full of miseries and stresses and sufferings and blah blah. Maybe people can talk about the gloomy side of their lives only anonymously. Or, maybe the unhappy students do not take the bus."

I was not critically judging you as you probably think I was.

You write for the Cornell Daily Sun.

With my sophisticated vocabulary I managed a 6th grade explanation about how much I enjoy reading your work and how I love your ""beautiful inspirations"".

Well, that's true. Well, it's much more than true. 

Not only do I love your words, but I'm in love with every aspect of your character. 

Your relentless pursuit for the advocacy of others, your desire for goodness as the norm and your hope for a better life for everybody... You are my dream woman. 

Not to mention your soft, perky voice and curly hair flaunt your beauty so humbly. 

Well if not in this world, a magical world perhaps, how can I ever be with a woman as beautiful as you?

 In what world can we fall in love and make Cornell, or life, worth living to its fullest?"

I wish there was a room I could go into and press a button and just be vaporized instantly without any trace. I would so do that. Just instantly broken up into atoms, totally untraceable. No pain, no remains, not even dust, just individual atoms that would bond, dissipate, etc. immediately. And no record of me going in or cameras. Just mysteriously gone forever. I think that solves all the problems with suicide. Because I don't wanna kill myself, I just want to disappear, i.e. cease to exist immediately in any non-fundamental form."

I have a hot girlfriend and this causes me trouble. There is always someone interested in her. Men give her small gifts (such as chocolates the day after valentine's), invite her for 1-on-1 dinners,… ugh. They know about me but they still do it. My GF is mature and knows what she wants, making this clear to others; that is good. I am graduating and she is not… that can be a problem. However, I am a good boyfriend: I am always there, I cook for her and give her good presents. 

I know I shouldn’t be worried, but I was in her situation once. I had a great girlfriend, but I had someone else interested in me. When I had a fight with that GF, I thought about the other. Don’t judge me, I didn’t do anything."

I was kicked out of Cornell for being accused of committing a horrible crime; sexual assault. The only issue is, I didn't do it. Ithaca Police say I didn't do it. Other people say I didn't do it. I say I didn't do it. But yet, Cornell somehow finds me guilty. Cornell is not a legal body, so why are they investigating these crimes when a real legal body already did? Too often students have their rights infringed on because of false biases and misinformed investigations without any credible evidence. So, when Cornell's name is slandered on national media outlets, just know it's for a valid reason. I'm coming for you, Cornell."

I think I've developed a crush on a student who's been in both classes I've been a TA for (current and last semester). We've only had indirect contact (like email/FB/etc), but it's been equal parts socializing and course related stuff. I'm not sure if she's interested in me or not but I kind of hope that she would recognize the (very) subtle hints I've given that show I'm interested. I thought I got past the point of developing a crush. =(

The knowledge that nothing lasts forever is keeping me from fully enjoying what we have. I know, better to have loved & lost than never to have loved at all, but there are just so many variables that destroy love and it is hard to handle. I'm scared of the day when I allow myself to get attached and you say adios sucker. Things honestly seem to good to be true and I can't help but be a major skeptic. I've been lied to and manipulated before and while I can tell you're different, I know you still have the capacity to hurt me.

To #4888:

*Please do not think I'm fat shaming or condoning any of that type of behavior.*

Having been overweight before, if you want people to be attracted to you, you might want to lose some weight.  It was hard for me to imagine someone not liking me because of my weight.  It was unfair, I thought, that anyone would withhold feelings because of something so petty and shallow.  It took me a long time to realize that I couldn't be butthurt about what people did and did not find attractive.  I could bitch and moan all I wanted about how fit guys with shit personalities would get all the ladies while I was alone, but it wouldn't change my standing with women.  The thing is, you can't be mad that people aren't turned on by you, regardless of what the cause is.  It's not their choice to be turned on or not, and it's irrational to expect someone to enter into a romantic relationship with a person that doesn't rev their engine.  

That said, as long as you're comfortable with who you are and you're comfortable with your standing, there's no need to change.  But yes, it may close some doors for you, no fault of yours or the potential partners who aren't physically attracted to you.  There are people who love curvy women, or fat women, or obese women (I don't know where you fall), but the vast majority of people are turned on by physically fit people.  I think it's an evolutionary thing, or maybe it's programmed into us by society, or both, but whatever it is, if you lose weight, you will open so many doors for yourself.  I did, and now I'm having better luck with women.  

Sorry if this is rambling, or unclear, or offensive.  I just thought I'd share my opinion and experiences."

Reading all that you've written makes me love your mind even more.

I don't understand sex drive. In movies and news, whenever a man is deprived of a woman's company for a long time, say several years, it is accepted that he will be overcome with an overwhelming and uncontrollable urge to rape the first woman he sees. Is this real? Is this society? Biology? Am I just watching weird movies? I had sex a few times 2 years ago. I'm a perfectly sexual woman, but I could honestly see myself going the rest of my life celibate if I needed to. (without going insane/feeling unstable or uncontrollable)

Am I just too casual? Is this a gender thing?"
3255,2015-02-22 15:58:39,"4894
Do I believe in love?

How could I know? We'll never know if you and I see the same blues, reds, or greens. Maybe the love I see is just a little different than yours. Maybe I'm color blind and just don't know it. Perhaps I go through the motions just fine, without a second guess, until you mention the number on the card that I just can't seem to find. But I've seen that number before, other places; I know it exists, just not on that card, for me.

But if I squint my eyes, sometimes, I think I can see it. But is that just because you told me it was there?

How could I know?"
3256,2015-02-22 15:28:40,"4893
I used to think that I was average looking, but appreciated for my personality. But lately, I'm starting to think the exact opposite: that I'm just attractive enough to be a token but hated for my personality. I'm not used to having any physical self esteem, but this new insecurity is ten times worse and is preventing me from concentrating on anything."

Not having to deal with the superiority complex of fraternity and sorority members has made my experience here so much better. All the students on campus much more friendly and people just want to go out and have a good time without the exclusivity and drama.

The ONLY thing I dislike about Cornell is the massive Greek presence. Can't say I'm looking forward to not having much to do on weekend nights again when I come back next semester."

I've been having this recurring dream every couple weeks since coming to Cornell.  In it, I'm lying in bed and check the winning lottery tickets on my phone and realize all five numbers and the multiplier  (numbers I've picked based on my birthday, my gf's birthday, and our anniversary) on my ticket match the drawing numbers.  Immediately I feel a sense of freedom and relief and get up and start packing up my room without telling anyone.  I go down to the car dealership and buy a 2015 Ford Mustang.  I've never really liked that car but why not?  I can do whatever the fuck I want, so I pack up my car and hit the road.  I begin the 3,000 mile drive to Los Angeles in a state of pure happiness, knowing that for the first time in my life I don't have to worry about finances or what I'm going to make of my life.  I don't have to take classes I don't want to take because I need to maximize my return on investment.  I don't have to feel guilty for not taking absolute advantage of every opportunity here.  I don't have to feel guilty when my parents let me know that there isn't any money for me to come home.  I don't have to deal with the condescending shits in Day Hall.  I don't have to pretend to care about this place.  I can just be.  I've never felt so liberated or limitless as I do in this dream.

But then I wake up and realize that it was all a figment of my imagination, that I'm still here and my parents are still back west basking in the sunshine and drowning in a sea of debt.  And immediately I feel useless and alone and ungrateful and lazy.  I realize like I do every morning that I should get used to this because I'll be working some 9-5 job until I'm sixty-five and I have a fat enough retirement fund so I can enjoy my last twenty years of old age and think about all the shit I'll regret not being able to do.  But I'll probably put a bullet in my head before then so I guess I don't really have to worry about that.

I want so badly to slip away from this place in the middle of the night without anyone ever realizing I was here and move west so I can live a life of ease and happiness, but I know deep down that that will never happen.  So for now I'll continue to trudge through the snow on my way to my 9 am classes and hope that someday this all pays off.  I'll keep pretending that deep down I want to be some hoity-toity businessman because I don't really have many alternatives.  And every day I'll die a little bit more inside but I'll continue to cling to the hope that I can work things out.  I don't know what to do when that runs out though."

I know without doubt that the only reason he friendzoned me is because I'm overweight. I shouldn't be upset, because it does show a certain shallowness on his part. However is this going to be the rest of my life unless I lose weight? Will I not even get a chance with guys I'm extremely compatible with just because of my weight?"

I'm a mechanical engineer major who probably should have been a physics major. My secret for getting through p-set after p-set of beams bending and shafts getting twisted is to put on daft punk and pretend I'm a robot. Problem is, sometimes it carries over to regular life. I was just wondering if other engineering majors are stereotypically awkward like me because they're pretending to be robots to get through drudgery?"

She hangs out with a white girl a lot, usually they work out together and I've seen them in the library together. She's absolutely gorgeous. I wish I could tell you more about her...any guesses?"

To make matters worse I'm pretty sure my SO thinks I'm cheating with that person even though I'm not...

A lot of stress is building up around this problem, because 1. I know us breaking up is going to lead to a large amount of stress for both of us... right in the middle(?) of the semester and 2. I panic whenever I think about another person going out with the person I've been starting to like..."

Freshman year I was the guy who thought he could stay with a girl long distance. I would (more nights than not) take my suite mate's guitar and sing for her over FaceTime. Then I'd wake up the next morning before I knew she would just to text good morning and I love you. 

Much much later, I've finally decided to actually start looking again, so single ladies, where y'all at? Now I want someone to sing to in person :)"

Why can't I be normal? The dark, obsessive thoughts that take over my head leave me feeling numb or in pain. It's become so bad that the thoughts feel weighted. They take my energy so I can't get out of bed, my chest hurts, it's hard to breath. I can't tell my parents because they threatened to make me drop out and send me to an mental institution. 

The intensity is so much worse than it was as a freshmen, and I feel like my professors and classmates are sick of my same old thing. What do I tell them? My best friend told me it was too much for her, and so I lie to others to spare them my burden...maybe because I'm terrified of what they'll say. I continue to lie. On the days where I lay in my bed and stare at the same cracks in my white ceiling thinking about how much of a useless fuck up I am, those days are the same ones I force myself to laugh about with my classmates as I purposely degrade myself and my integrity to keep them from knowing the truth. It's far easier to tell someone you're just lazy than to tell them about the crippling depression and fear that some day you might just do something terrible."

I really really hate all the sorority hate that rears its head once in a while on anonymous forums (here and on yik yak). Mostly it makes me uncomfortable because it seems that a lot of people feel that way, and I can't help but be self-conscious if I'm wearing my letters. I wonder if people are judging me when they don't even know me. 

The vast VAST majority of us are nice, normal people. I don't look down on people not in the Greek system, I have a lot of non-affiliated friends, and I didn't become the wicked witch of the west when I joined, and I love my sorority so hop off."

To the people hating on the kid making the comment about his credit limit. The beautiful thing about credit is that it doesn't depend on you being rich. My family isn't exactly well off and I started building my credit when I was in Middle School. It depends on you being an excellent and responsible borrower. Having a $100 limit on a card and using and paying back $7 even looks great. 

Even just get a card, use it for the 1 time per week you get coffee, pay off the balance, and your on your way to building your credit.

There are very wealthy people who have terrible credit because they don't know how to correctly manage it, even though they pay everything in full and on time."

I actually don't believe in global warming or climate change, whatever ya liberals or Republicrats wanna call it. Al Gore and other leftist politicians are making massive amounts of money peddling such a lie to uneducated fools. After all, CO2 is essential for plant life and plant growth. You need to understand concentrations, something that I as a PhD grad know. I am also a postdoctoral associate and I understand that the levels of CO2 in the atmosphere are actually helping with plant growth across the globe and there is no evidence to prove we are warming or that any conditions are the result of increased levels of CO2. We have the coldest temperatures on record currently for most parts of the globe. I do also believe that we are slowly progressing towards a colder climate as we are overdue for an ice age......Don't stress about fossil fuels and ""fracking."" Everything will be all right for y'all, after all we couldn't have the standard of living we currently have at Cornell if it were not for good ol' shale gas...our power plant consumes it and loves it over any other fuel coming mostly from the great states of West Virgina and Pennsylvania. (Shout out to whoever is from there) It's a fuel that burns cleanly and produces virtually no NOx and SOx with the right emissions control as we have at the CHP plant here at Cornell. America is once again energy independent....we are becoming net exporters of energy and it's benefiting our economy in the long run because of the shale gas revolution. Take some CHEME courses and actually learn about a great industry.....You will not be disappointed.  Go USA! USA! USA! ;)"

I saw you again today. Don't you know what seeing you does to me? My heart starts beating faster and a lump forms in my throat. It usually ruins my entire day and week and I can't focus. I always get bad news after seeing you. I try avoiding you as much as possible. This would be easier if you didn't hang out in the engineering quad so much. You're not even an engineer! We can never go back to the way it was freshman year and that hurts me. It's too bad we have a lot of mutual friends so I see you even when I don't want to. Your Facebook posts show that you have many friends. I haven't been that lucky and so maybe I'm jealous. I really hope you are graduating this year like you planned so I don't have to see you next year. You're bad luck. I never thought I would hate someone so much. Please do yourself a favor and avoid me as much as possible. Seeing you brings back memories that hurt and I'm already depressed enough. So, please.

I'm 20 years old and for as long as I can remember I've never had a best friend. When I was in elementary school in a city, we were relatively poor and my parents were working all the time. So, that meant I had to take care of myself and my younger sister and make sure both of us got home safe right after school. So, it didn't happen then. In high school, same story different city. Well, it wasn't really a city. It was a suburban town with a rich school district. I didn't fit into the culture there so I really didn't have a best friend. I mean I talked to a couple of the guys in my classes but never like hanging out on the weekend, watching movies, etc. In retrospect, neither of us took the initiative to contact the other to hang out. When I came to Cornell, I threw myself into my studies completely. I knew coming in that I wasn't as smart as my peers. So, from the beginning, I put in extra hours to keep up(and in engineering that is probably the best way if you're not naturally gifted). I treated this as my job. I followed the same schedule week after week, semester after semester. I came close to having a best friend freshman year. In my robotic routine, this girl on my floor somehow fit herself in. She would always make sure to invite me to brunch or any other activity she was doing with the RAs. She would often come to my room to do homework, play cards, etc. Soon I realized that I was becoming too reliant on her maybe because she was the first real friend I had. I found myself falling for her hard. I tried to distance myself from her because I didn't want to get distracted from schoolwork. Soon after that, she stopped trying and things fell apart. We lost touch late freshman year. I occasionally see her around campus, but she doesn't acknowledge me and I don't say anything either(awkward, I know).
Now that I am a junior where things are leveling out, I find I have some free time and nothing to do. By no means am I saying I don't know people. I live in a pretty large apartment with a bunch of guys. But beyond the occasional ""hey, how are you?"" or some conversation about grades, weather, etc., (I really don't like small talk but it's such a big part of the working world that I had to adjust.) I don't really know these guys. They are all engineers and/or pre-meds who are either busy double majoring, graduating early, or just Cornell things.
Anyways, today, it just hit me that I don't have a best friend. (Do guys even have best friends?) I am by no means depressed about being lonely (after some time you get used to be alone and living in your own world). I just wonder what it's like. On bad days(like this one), I wish there was someone to talk to. I often end up hugging my pillow and falling asleep hoping tomorrow is a better day. I guess I have internalized 20 years worth of emotions and thoughts. Oh well, I'll graduate in a year and Cornell will become a blur in the memory (college really isn't that exciting. I don't know why people say it's the best time of your life).

P.S. Sorry for so many paren(theses) <--- see what I did there and also for rambling it's the start of Feb. break and I have the winter blues and once I started typing I couldn't stop."

American Express just raised my limit to $25,000. I'm 22. I can't stress the importance of having several credit cards and building up your credit, guys. I've run into so many people who are just opposed to credit cards on principle; don't know which ones to get; or have just 1 that their parents got for them; generally refuse to think for themselves when it comes to credit and finances. Trust me, I have 5 credit cards, I use them all for different things to maximize rewards, they make me hundreds of dollars every year, and I've never paid a cent in interest. I get the best offers, and by the time I have to get a mortgage I'll have stellar credit. And all it cost me was doing some research and some basic planning. Saying that credit cards will get you into debt is like saying that food will make you fat. Don't be dumb, get a credit card ASAP. A big part of your credit score is how long you've had a credit line, so the sooner you have one, the better off you'll be in the long term."

OMG! this has been an interesting valentine's day. My roomie and I discussed to do something on friday, like hit the movies or grab some delicious dessert. NONE of that shit happened. WHY? her excuse started off w/ ""my stomach hurts"" yet we hit the dining hall and devoured like 2 plates. i told her i could grab her some tea or something warm. she rejected any sort of warm therapy. it was 9 ish (pm), ""Hey, i doubt ill can go out, this tummyache is bad.""  Five minutes later, grabs her phone and starts talking to her Bf. BITCH! i turned down my plans with another friend JUST to spend some time with you. I didnt care about the movie or the dessert, i JUST wanted some quality time wit ya, after having a shitty week full of exams. And, TODAY? oh, her Bf came over..... while, I am here doing a paper. Great F**** way roomie! F*** YU! this just makes me realize of how much (rather how little) you value me. thanks.
i wish he would just realize of how of a fake, hypocrite, bitch you are. You are sure not the way that you are around me when you are with him or with your ""OTHER FRIENDS.""

To the comments made on #4806
A. I think people take this page a wee bit too seriously and I personally didn't feel the need to get into a back and forth about what is and isn't ""slut shaming"" in a public forum.

B. I don't think the op was slut shaming just because he/she doesn't see the value in hooking up with random people doesn't mean she thinks any less of he/she doesn't think less of their friends. Also, maybe he/she is religious and doesn't believe in sex until marriage- or has non religious values that line up the same. I think that before accusing someone of ""slut shaming"" without their explicit saying of that is kind of jumping the gun.  Personally, I don't really care about the hook up culture here- people who do it do it and so be it. Just because someone someone doesn't think they personally will get anything out of it doesn't mean they're shaming everyone who does it. Hooking up is fun, not hooking up is fun. But attacking someone because of their personal beliefs- whatever they may be is a bit uncalled for.  But hey that's just my opinion and I was too much of a wimp to comment on the post . :D"

Response to 4809: College isn't just about going to class, doing well and achieving every academic and career-related opportunity. College is about finding yourself. Just because someone who really wanted to come to this school was rejected, doesn't mean that they aren't having a social life at the college they ended up at."

Looking forward to working out tomorrow and seeing familiar faces in the gym. Gym = home. Go have your flowers and sex, people. In 2 years I'll be a buff dude in my prime and all the girls will flock to me (I was told that's how it works), and in 2 years you'll still be skinny people who may or may not be with someone. Invest in a good body early - enjoy a life as a living legend longer."

I like my friends here; they're all really fantastic. I like our late night chats when we open up about things below the surface. I just wish for more. I know it's an idiotic and impossible thing to wish for but it's so hard to go from a group of friends who have 10 years of memories and bonding to a friend group that has had 6 months. I want to be super comfortable around them and speak my mind and never feel like I'm a burden or that I'm pushing the limits of our fragile bond. Instead, I speak carefully and hope that soon, this wonderful group of people will become family just like the wonderful group of people back home became family."

""I want to thank the man who this record is about, who I fell in love with last year,"" said Sam Smith. ""Thank you so much for breaking my heart, because you got me four Grammys."" 

Just remember: whatever pain you're going through, no matter how enduring it seems, is actually ephemeral. Heartbreak, school woes, family issues, self image problems, whatever you are going through: you can overcome it. Doing so won't occur overnight but you have to cultivate the pain and make it into something useful. Make the pain worthwhile. Tattoo it on you. Don't squelch it in shame but own it. Use it. Sam Smith did."

Being a freshman in the black community has been so frustrating. Everyone claims to be supportive of each other and we continually talk about how we look out for each other when we don't. Freshman cliques are already set and there so hard to get into. Sometimes I walk into an event and people stare at me like I'm stupid. There are some people in the community that when I smile or say hi to (and I know they don't know me) they look at me like I'm stupid. It's hard being here as a minority and it's sad that can't even find comfort in my on community."

My best friend is not the same person anymore.  She’s been going through some complications, and they’ve been so hard on her and they’ve changed her.  And I don’t know what to do.  Last night she called me and left a voice mail in tears.  I called her back and she told me she wants to go to heaven.  This is the first time I’ve ever dealt with something like this.  She is suicidal, and I have no idea what to do.  I want to be there for her, but I have no clue what to say to her or how to deal with someone when they say something like that.  I’ve heard of empathy over sympathy, but how do you do that?  What do you say to someone who tells you they want to end their life?

How do you deal with your best friend changing as a person?  She had an infection and became septic, and it’s been messing with her brain.  Her condition is super rare, but there is hope she’ll become healthy again.  But it’s been months already and I don’t know how long this will last."

It's been a year, but it still bothers me to this day. Some friends and I were walking in ctown and I overheard a bunch of sorority girls refer to us as ""those Asians."" We were all born & raised in the US and we're friends with all types of people, but it just so happened that our group at that moment consisted of one racial sector (not even of the same ethnicity). It still upsets me that we were categorized and judged so quickly. After that incident, I began to notice more and more micro-aggressions and generalizations happening on this campus against all sorts of people. I'd never experienced something like that before coming here. I hate being seen as just ""another one."""

Words can not express how utterly embarrassed I am by some of the student protestors who talked to Skorton. While some were able to accurately portray student's frustrations about this fee others were ridiculous, profane, and incredibly disrespectful. Do you even realize how much Cornell really gives to it's students? The access to free mental health services, free librarians who are experts in their fields, the amount of students who aren't paying a dime to go here because their parents can't afford college, hell we even get a giant concert at the end of the year! This doesn't mean you cant be mad about the fee, but it means you need to check your privilege as a Cornell student."

OK, so this is kind of long and wierd but here goes.

I met my girlfriend a year ago via the internet.  We mostly just chatted for a while, like she was one of my friends here.  Then I decided to take a leap of other faith and we exchanged contact information, got in touch on Facebook, everything.  And through it all, I slowly fell in love.  Asked her if she felt the same, she said yes, yay! But she's several states away, boo.  We text and call, even Skype every day, but I still miss her. I want to hold her and kiss her and love her in person. So I applied to a bunch of internships in her home city, but I haven't heard from any of them.  Saying no is one thing - I can live with rejection and bad luck.  But this silence... Every day that goes by without any news just breaks my heart a little bit more.  I hate that I need her so much.  It's painful when the only way I can see her is through a screen.  But I'm doing my best to turn that pain into motivation, that if I work hard and pray (I'm not even religious) I might have my wish granted. 

I haven't told anyone about her yet. My parents are already worried I'm becoming a bit of a recluse (though I do my fair share of getting out) and I have no idea how to explain it to anyone.  I feel bad for that, actually.  They deserve to know, and she's a wonderful person, but I'm worried they won't like her or something.  I have no idea what to say, but I really want to say something.

So instead of that, Im hiding behind anonymity and getting the main things of my chest.  If you guys read through all thus, one, wow you have patience and two, thanks, sincerely.  It's nice to have someone listen"
3383,2015-02-11 21:12:52,"4766
I love you and everything but I hate it when you're so indecisive. I've gradually realized that you're selfish too and do not take ""no"" or ""you're wrong"" for an answer. Sometimes you have to just accept that you're wrong but I don't think you're brave enough or strong enough to do that."

I don't know if the #fightthefee video is supposed to get me riled up or empathize with my fellow peers, but all it did was make me sympathize with Skorton. As someone who is on a shit ton of financial aid, I equally protest the fee but some people here are such assholes. There had to be a better way to go about it than make comedic gestures behind his back or speak over him as he tries to answer questions or snicker at every word. Maybe someday we'll have a president that can satisfy the demands of all 14,393+ students but until that day comes, we can at least respect the president we do have even if we might not agree with him.

So Skorton, if you reading this, I apologize on behalf of every rude ""protestor""."

@#4742 on non-native English speakers: YES. You captured my feelings EXACTLY; thank you! I am tired of hearing American students make fun of their peers for their accents/pronunciation. 

English is my first language but I grew up in another part of the English-speaking world, and people here keep trying to correct/mock the way we say certain words. For instance, ""homogeneous"" (hi, MATH2930 classmates last semester) or ""presentation""... ... Before you make fun of someone for not talking the same way you do, remember that i) your way may not be the only right way and ii) most people would fail horribly at getting a college education in a non-native tongue.

Do you know how to say ""linearly independent"" or ""row equivalent"" in your own second language? Yeah...now imagine taking every single class in a language you don't use at home. You think orgo is hard in English? Pssh. Have some respect for your classmates instead of sniggering when they open their mouths."

It's part of a third person account of my sexual assault last semester. I wrote it in an attempt to step back and make peace with myself. Going through that made me very aware of rape culture. I was judged for thinking about coming forward and told to think about his future, to not ruin his life because I ""felt bad."" But I was also judged for not coming forward, because that makes me a bad victim. Everyone I've told has made me feel like this is not important, or that it was my fault, they don't think it was a big deal because I had originally given consent, even though it can be taken away. 

Consent is a very complicated issue, and sexual assault is a serious crime, but a lot of students here are very ignorant about the issue even though they think they aren't. I'm ok now, but I still feel the judgement and criticism of people who think I was in the wrong. I know I'm not the only one who has gone/is going through this and I think that's what makes me sad."

I really just need to say it somewhere. I love you. I didn't mean for it to happen. It shouldn't have happened, but it did. Sometime during the casual hookups, I fell for you, hard. Now, you want to be ""just friends,"" but I have no idea how to tell you how impossible that is for me. It hurts too much to have just part of you, so I think I'll have to give up all of you. I'm sorry."

I've been feeling depressed lately because of the long distance relationship I'm in. I went through a rough last semester with communication problems, there were times we wouldn't talk for days, where we would bottle up our feelings and not mention any issues we were having until we blew up on eachother. Because of that, I was upset a lot trying to get him to open up, especially since communication was all we had. I would party and flirt with guys to get him off my mind. I had made a lot of mistakes and decided this semester would be a start new for us. Over winter break we discussed that we would work better on our communication to help the relationship, and now the new semester is here and I feel the same process happening again. I'm closing myself up to people again and I spend nights just missing him, crying randomly. It doesn't help that I see him only a couple times a year since he doesn't live where I live. And it doesn't help that we have communication problems. Sometimes I wonder why I decided to stay in this, sometimes I feel so mad at myself for what I did last semester and how I feel the same cycle creeping up on me. But the way we feel about each other... it makes me feel like going through with the relationship is absolutely worth it. He is genuinely so compassionate, kind, loving, and when I see him I just fall in love all over again. I just wish he would open up more and I wish that I wasn't so depressed about it. I'm scared about the future."

There's this girl I talk to in my one class. I keep wanting to ask her to get lunch or something, but she seems like she's always in such a rush after that class. Besides, she's graduating in a few months anyway, and I doubt anything would come of it. Oh well."
3398,2015-02-09 20:32:25,"4751

People always think I'm crazy for taking so many credits, but school isn't what worries me. What scares me is having time alone to think, because that's when I'm afraid I'll become depressed again. So until I find a cure for depression, I'm perfectly content having no free time due to my course load."
3399,2015-02-09 20:59:27,"4750

We've slept together 3 times and each time was perfect. Sleeping close with you after was amazing. Now when I sleep I have to put a pillow into my chest and imagine it's you otherwise I can't fall asleep. I miss the touch of your smooth soft skin and the smell of your soft hair. I love how perfectly our bodies had fit together when we spooned. I know we're not a couple but I wish you could sleep next to me every night. I actually dream about this girl and wake up looking for her and the last time we slept together was over a month ago"

I like him. A LOT more than I thought I would. Just being with him. But he was never looking for anything serious from the start. He changed at the end of the semester, though, and I thought he was changing, maybe even liked me a bit...Now we are back and he's pushing me away again."

""All my life I have put other people before myself and I've been miserable. Why should I do my best to make sure other people are happy when they can't see how much I suffer? I always offered myself up ready to do as much as I could to support people - but you know what? I'm not a pushover. If people want to trivialize me then they're not worth my time so I'll cut them from my life. 

Good things seem only to happen to bad people so maybe its time for me to be a lot more selfish."

Coming in as a transfer it's so crazy for me to realize that there are kids working their asses off in small colleges people have never heard of who are even smarter than the people here.

She felt relieved that it was over, and it wasn't until a few minutes had passed that the tears came. She cried. She cried at what had happened, cried at who she had become. When had she gone from the sweet, hopeless romantic to the girl that gives her body away so easily? Why had she let him stay? Why hadn't she said no? It was her fault, it had to be, she agreed to it, she wanted it, she never said no, she didn't ask him to leave, it was all her fault. She felt dirty, she felt used, she felt like a whore. She tried to sleep, to put it to rest, but all she could think about was his face, his words, the way he touched her, his teeth pushing into her skin. She stood up and looked at her naked body in the mirror, she looked at her bruised breasts, her tear-stained face, her tangled hair. She went back to bed, but she couldn't sleep. How could she sleep on the sheets his body touched, how could she sleep on the pillows scented with his sweat. She got up and showered, she scrubbed her skin to get him off of her, to get the feeling of his hands off her body. She took the sheets from her bed and threw them on the floor, she changed her bed sheets and pillow cases and went back to bed praying for sleep, blaming herself, trying to cross this off as a bad decision."

""I want to express a couple of concerns in regards to the English language here at Cornell.

Cornell, being an Ivy League, welcomes students from all over the world, with different backgrounds, cultures and native languages. All seem to go along well except for one: Difference in native languages resulting in different accents of the English language.

In the two semesters I have here at Cornell, besides being a transfer student from a US school and still not fluent in English, I have seen lots of people underestimating others just because of their level of English. I only have 3 years learning/speaking English, and I think I have learned it pretty quick. However, I don't let anyone hold me down anymore. 

I just want to get across two points: 

     If you don't know a second language, please do not make comments like """"Can you speak English?"""" or """"Your English is not good"""". You have no idea what it is to go to another country to a university where the language used is a language you never learned/spoke before. Many times have I struggled in my classes just because I don't understand the material yet I try very hard to remain on the boat. If you take any foreign languages, try to visit the country where the language is spoken and hold various conversations with as many people. You will notice how challenging it is. PLEASE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT BESIDES OF OUR SPEAKING ABILITIES OF ENGLISH, WE ARE IN THE SAME OR EVEN HIGHER ACADEMIC POSITION YOU ARE.

     My second point is that you have to understand that we are not really interested in learning English. Many of us, including me, are forced to learn English just because we want a degree from a prestigious university. My native language is Spanish, and I am totally fine with it and proud of it. Surely English opens doors worldwide, but I think my English is good for day-to-day communication and I am not interested in getting the """"American"""" accent or become fluent in it. I DO NOT WANT TO GET RID OF MY ACCENT AND FORGET MY NATIVE LANGUAGE. So please, be kind to others who are English as a second language students. """

Before coming to Cornell, I was ambivalent towards hook-up culture. I thought it was a rational arrangement, both people mutually benefit with no strings attached. Especially once you realize the amount of stress coming your way from classes and the constant problem of figuring-out-what-you-want-to-do, it would take a lot of energy to add a relationship on top of all that. There's the possibility that the person you like is far away from your hometown, person is about to graduate, person is in/not in the greek system, etc, but you still have a burning desire for that person. So, it makes sense why loosely defined relationships are often established. However, the nature of the capricious relationship can also lead to more hurt than if you were to just stay single or in a real relationship. After going through a fwb, I will say it's more trouble than it's worth. In the beginning, it feels like a win-win situation, but it gets harder later on because you or the other person may change their mind, find someone else, want more, etc. In the end, someone or both people always get hurt. It can make you feel really insecure and impair your ability to focus on the rest of your life. Things can get really awkward after it's over, so more stress to deal with. 

Bottom-line, transcend the hook-up culture. People are not objects that you can just play around with, so please value yourself and others. It's more worth your time to find amazing people and cultivate friendships that will last a lifetime or make an earnest effort to begin a relationship with someone. As tempting as it is to give into lust, the satisfaction is ephemeral and doesn't fill you up the way genuine happiness would keep you sane."

I guess my real confession is the shortest of forms is ths: As an Asian female, I can't watch Fresh Off the Boat with my white boyfriend. 

I recognize that in a post racial society, we’re not supposed to see race as an important construct.  To a certain extent, I don’t.  I’ve dated Asian guys, black guys, white guys, and Indian guys, a clarifier that apparently needs to be applied because of some confusion on what exactly constitutes as “Asian.”  But I’ve never had a problem relating with others, falling in love, and being heart broken by any person before.  But today, I was snuggled on his bed and opened my laptop to play Fresh Off the Boat for the first time, my boyfriend flippantly said ""This show is going to be cancelled."" 

At that moment, when my white boyfriend couldn’t understand my hope for this show, I realized that there are certain experiences that could never be fully and completely translated to him, that there is a part of my life that hours of conversations cannot make him understand. This lack of understanding though is what makes Fresh off the Boat such a gratifying and necessary phenomenon.  I think that having a show that tries to authentically and engagingly describe what it's like to feel like an outsider in a country you've called home your entire life broadcasted to millions of Americans is something we Asian Americans have desperately wanted.  We haven't had a show like this since All American Girl (which only made Asian moms seem too stereotypically stern and Asian grandmothers eccentrically awesome).  

But it startled me and saddened me how hopeful I was for this show.  It wasn't until today that I realized how much we as a group are relying on Eddie Huang to pull this off, and how fragile out faith is in that."

Im not in love with him, I dont want to spend my life with him because we dont have much in common. But I haven't been able to stop thinking about him for the last 4 months. I will be leaving Cornell soon and I will probably never see him again after that. I just wish I could tell him how I felt. I wish I could read his mind to know how he feels about me. Every time he looks at me, I get all warm and fuzzy inside. I just want to hold him and tell him how attracted I am to him. I hope one day, even if it is just for the day, you feel for me what I feel for you."

My girlfriend has serious communication issues.  She'll let things build up and won't say anything to me until everything explodes.  I'll know when these moments are about to happen because she'll reply to my texts with words like ""Yes"" and ""k"" (She usually uses ""yeah"" instead of ""yes"", and no person in a good mood responds to anything with ""k"").  If she responds to multiple texts in a row with single words, that's how I know shit's about to go down.  But no matter what I do, no matter how much I try and convince her that she should talk to me about the issues that lead to these fights so that we can work through it constructively rather than get pissed at each other, she always tells me that I'm blaming her for everything.  

I can do no right.  It doesn't help at all that we're in a long-distance relationship.  I don't know what to do.  Sometimes I feel like I'm dating a toddler."

I'm mad at my ""best friend"". I'm slowly coming to a realization that she only needs me whenever it's convenient for her. She doesn't really care what's going on with me, what's going on on the inside, what I'm thinking about and feeling. I hate when she is on her phone when I'm talking to her or she picks up her phone to talk to another person when I'm mid sentence. She's just inconsiderate. Not only am I mad at her. I'm very hurt. My birthday was a week ago, but I still keep thinking about how she did not try to make me feel special at all. I mean birthdays don't happen every day, and she didn't even give an ounce of an effort. She attended the birthday dinner that I organized, and that's about it. She didn't get me a present, or a card, didn't bake me a cake so I can blow the candles, didn't even make a post on Facebook. I mean she gets her boyfriend small gifts all the time for no reason...she even blew up balloons and got a present for one of our suite mates. But she did absolutely nothing for her ""best friend"" who apparently to her, I'm the closest person. I feel like this relationship is one sided. I hate for feeling this way but truth hurts."

From day one, she was always able kindle my love with her smile and beauty, but its just a small flame that yearns for her warmth. It's just scary that she has this hold on me.

Cornell is truly an example of ""Anything is possible"".  There is nothing like paying $2400 a year for a Student Insurance you never use and when you finally find your way around to not pay for the student insurance (getting another low-cost insurance with similar coverage), BOOM, they come with a Student Health fee for non-holders of SHIP.

I used to see you in our building's library and dining hall and just around, and now I NEVER see you!  WHAT is the DEAL?????  Did you graduate??? This is a confession of missing someone I don't really talk to, but that I want to talk to except now I can't because I NEVER SEE YOU :'("

I've had so much anxiety lately and I have no clue what to do about it. I can't fall asleep for several hours every night and I spend most of my waking time worrying about prelims and being scared that I will fail my classes and get kicked out of Cornell. I think I'm anxious to the point where it really hurts me, and it wouldn't surprise me if I actually do really badly in school just because I spend so much time worrying instead of studying. I also can't seem to concentrate on my work at all. I have no idea what to do about this, I've been to CAPS before and they were not very helpful, but rather mean to me. I would never want to go back to Gannett again. And I have looked around at therapists and psychiatrists in Ithaca but it seems hopeless to find someone good. Family and Children Services turned me down and so have other therapists I've talked to in Ithaca because they said that they didn't think they would be able to help me. I feel like I have nowhere to turn to and I don't know how I'll be able to get through this semester without some support… :("

I was turned away from a several of companies from career fair today simply because of my GPA (last semester didn't go s well) I was disappointed and angry at first, but I now see this as an opportunity to better myself. Although it seems impossible, I am going bring my GPA out of the abyss by earning all A's this semester.... in engineering. I will accept nothing less. May God grant me strength."

To the cute guy that lives in my building:
You're out of my league. That's painfully obvious to me. And yet, our eyes have a habit of meeting and when they meet, I can almost swear you feel the same magnetic pull towards me that I do towards you. But then I realize this is only wishful thinking on my part and quickly advert my eyes and scurry past in a vain attempt to minimize any further embarrassment. And, I can see how this could be misconstrued as me not being interested, but that is not the case. So I guess the point of this post is to say I like you but you make me nervous. And, if I am mistaken and the attraction is mutual, please let me know..."

I don't generally believe in love at first sight but it happened to me when I first saw you last Fall. By work of the holy spirit, we ended up together in the same teams in all three classes we were taking together and you were there always supporting me as a new student. I don't know if I will ever tell you my feelings towards you, but at this point you should probably know as I stare at you A LOT during class and always approach you anywhere I see you. I am pretty sure I am not attractive for you, but I hope I could tell you how much I love you girl so I can be happy with myself."

Going through a breakup while taking classes at Cornell is not easy. Three years of being best friends and partners to being strangers. It's been two months since the breakup and it's still hard to get out of bed sometimes. It sucks because being sick with the flu is a valid excuse to pause your life and stay in bed. But a broken heart? You have to keep moving because you can't wallow in that sadness forever."

i thought i could handle it but i cant. my emotions go from an extreme infatuation with you to hating you. whatever it is that i feel at a single moment i cant stop thinking about you. i go anywhere i could possibly see you hoping i catch a glimpse. why do you have to be graduating? i facebook search you and all of your male friends hating every single one of them. sometimes i just hang around in your dining hall hoping you wander in. everything about you excites me. your smile, your beautiful brown eyes, the way you speak and what you speak of, your laugh. i replay every single moment i spent with you in my head, searching for signs of how you feel about me. i cant sleep because of you. everything i do is about you. i talk about you with my roommates so much they know everything about you and never met you once. i knew the day i saw you in my class last semester you were special. i tried getting closer but you never let us spend time together. now youre ruining my life because i cant handle this obsession i have with you. i just hate you. but love you too. the moment i see you my inside burns. youre just a drug to me. i feel like i have no control of myself with you. i get so mad at you, i can hate you so much when we dont speak or when you push me away. but the moment i see you, i just fall a part. i want to be around you always. i dont want anyone else with you except me. i have this burning obsession and it's just swallowing me whole. she's graduating in may and staying in nyc but i dont know what to do. how do i stop this. it cant be healthy"

""I met this guy years ago and I never considered him anything more than friend. Then we came here and I really got to know him. Eventually, I fell for him. In fear of breaking our friendship, I never said anything. There were so many chances to do something, but I always chickened out. 

Winter break rolled around and he never talked. The person I talked to everyday disappeared for 5 weeks. So naturally, I believe I was more into him than he was, if he even was, into me. 

So now, I'm trying to move on, but I just can't. The one thing that moved me forward for 5 months is gone: hope. I hope this sickening feeling in my chest eventually disappears.  """

Last night, I cried...I cried with so much anger and hurt that I think even my roommate knew I was crying in my bed pretending to be sleeping. Well, the reason I cried is that my best friend, or who I thought was my best friend, did nothing to make me feel special on my birthday. She did not get me a card, she did not bake me a cake, she did not get me balloons, she did not get me a present, she did not even arrange the dinner, and she did not even make those stupid silly posts on FB. I waited patiently all day...thinking she was holding out on a huge surprise. But noooo there was nothing. On the opposite, she closed the door on me and ignored me like I wasn't there talking to her. I don't know what I should do. I feel taken for granted and not appreciated at all. She doesn't make the effort to be my best friend yet she uses those words every chance she gets. I just wish she actually did things a best friend would do."

I just turned down a six figure salary to make nearly 3 times less working for the government. Why? Because I believe in public service. I know this looks like bragging/guilt tripping/pointing out how much better I am than other people, etc. But let's remember that 1) This is anonymous, and 2) I just said no to $100K a year, because I believe in an idea, so I think I deserve a selfish moment of feeling good about myself in front of people, if only for a few seconds.

While it is an issue, it's not that big of an issue that I felt the need to post about it because I think we can work through it.

""I think I’ve overdone it. I’ve made it a nasty habit to, sometimes literally, run away from anything my heart and brain decide to jointly love. And I believe it is love. Possibly overdone brotherly love, but either way I am madly attracted by personality, and eyes, and his choices. I keep finding myself, telling myself that I’m not good enough for him. He doesn’t deserve me. But then I feel worse, because I know that for once I have found someone who is on my level, intellectually, as well as with wits, and humor, and laughter and affinity for life. In the few heart to heart conversations I’ve managed without letting my thoughts, aside from those of the conversation, get in the way, we have seen eye to eye. We’ve carried conversation over time and easily, calmly. He understands the importance of time alone, of silence, of the majesty of the morning when you feel like the only one alive and the world is yours. He notices the tiniest hints of humor, and knows that the turn of the head signals something has been spotted and he’s interested. He recognizes the sign of a person in distress. Which is why I think I scared him off. I can’t speak for him, I can’t say for sure what my face shows when I look at him, and help me, but if what I”m thinking when I happen to catch him eye to eye...those beautiful eyes...if only he knew, and yet that is what I fear. He is all that I have strived to be, devoted, kind, attentive, humorous, smart, focused and the list goes on. The respect I have for him is immense, and I feel like that could also be clouding my head when it comes to my emotions for him. 
 I’ve been trying to figure out how to let him go. The thing is, I don’t want to have to let him go, I want to be his friend, because I would be honored if he would let me be his friend. But everytime I get close, or have a friendly conversation, all I can think about afterwards is how much I just want to fall into those eyes, and I wonder what it would be like to earn his love. I imagine it would be impressive, and humbling, and very strong. 
 The similarities I’ve seen between the two of us is one of the ways that I’ve both connected and which I use to block him from my mind. We are so similar, I feel like we could be the sort to live quite well, being able to communicate, and be interested in the world etc, sharing interests, while also having unrelated ones to keep us with rounded personalities. And yet, these similarities I can tell myself are why it won’t work. Because if his response to feeling strong emotion towards someone not in the family is anywhere near mine, then we shall both be running in the opposite directions, running from our emotions. And because we can’t, because we live in the same dorm, and see each other every day, the most we can do is basically ignore the other. It makes me feel horrible inside. 
We are so similar that our reactions to unexpected or awkward attractions is to ignore it, to hide it, to throw it on the ground and test it’s strength. We’re waiting for someone to pick up the rock and hand it back, saying, yes, what you feel is real, and I feel it too. That rock heart you just threw? It hit my foot and hurt as much as it hurt for you to rip it out. Here, put it back, and let me warm your rock heart. But as usual, my aim is off, and as we each throw our respective rock hearts, they have missed their marks, leaving a scrape, but nothing more, and we stare at each other, why did you just throw a rock at me? Blink, and the connection is gone. Laugh, and my chest aches as I turn away. No. Don’t think. Don’t run. Don’t feel. Don’t be. Afraid. Don’t let it control. You. But jealousy? Passion? No. Just look away. Just walk. """

There is this girl  who thinks she is God's gift to the world. I'm not berating her for her appearance because we all have the right to and should love ourselves. Yet, this girl is completely arrogant about her appearance without due cause to be. She's the type to berate others for their appearance and puts others down because she thinks she's hot and she's really not standardly pretty by any means. It's such a warped point of view. Even if she was really pretty she wouldn't have the right to be cocky but the fact that she's not is even more disturbing. It's weird how there are girls who are actually conventionally pretty who don't think of themselves as such even though they are told so and are very humble about themselves and yet there's girls who are not who think they have the right to spit on others. This is so middle school, but it's disturbing. Beautiful or not, no need to act like a bitch who's better than everyone else."

Dad,
I sit here in my dorm room writing this letter three days before your birthday. Wow, this is already hard. I miss you. I like to think that there is a heaven and you are up there watching me live my life. Because it makes me sad to think that my dad doesn't know how I'm doing, what I'm doing, or how much I've already achieved. It's hard because you never expect your dad to not be there, not be able to celebrate everything. Like how you said that we'd get drinks on my 21st. Well, I'm 21 now and I'm going to have a drink for you on your birthday.
In case you didn't know, I've done some really awesome, exciting stuff. I'm even at Cornell! I'm 99% sure you'd be extremely proud of me.
The one thing I really hope you know though is that I love you. I really, really love you. No matter what. It's been hard since you left this world. I can't even believe it will have been five years this September. But I trust your judgement that heaven was going to be a happier place for you. And I still love you. I forever will.
With much love, I hope you have a good one, complete with cake, chocolate, fish & chips, and tea. 
Happy birthday, daddy."

In response to confession #4637:
I don't know if you are who I think you are but your words have compelled me to write about us. I swear I think of you every day. I was in a deep, dark hole last semester and I found solace being with you. I want you to take a step. If you can't be romantic with me, I'd still love to be your friend. You're a great person and it hurts to have your words and your smile creep into my mind without even knowing if you feel the same. I want to say I hate seeing you but I can't. I don't care what you want to call our relationship, I still want you and you alone. We both messed up, I'm willing to start this over. I tell myself I've moved on but sometimes I can't help but feel dead inside. The melancholy we shared will never dissipate from my mind."

I had a completely meaningless hookup with a friend of a friend I was casually seeing from time to time. I don't know why I did it, I wasn't drunk or anything. The guilt hit me the next day, but I was also mad at myself for feeling guilty.

I am a pathological liar. For years, I've had this problem. I've used it to make friends, to hook up at parties, to forge connections, and to do basically everything I felt I could not do with my own personality. But now, I've created a lie that is simply too great to apologize for. I can't tell you what it is at the risk of employers and friends seeing the page and judging me for it. I guess it's a constant struggle with envy of what other people have, my own personal struggle with self-worth, and my sexual frustrations, all combined into one massive personal insecurity. If anyone can tell me how to proceed with this, please let me know."
3506,2015-02-04 17:38:56,"4644
My sexual frustration is reaching a peak at school and I simply don't know where to turn anymore. For months on end, I've gone to parties where my friends have made out on dance floors and in some cases even taken the girls they've met back to their rooms to have sex. Girls really do have it easier than guys here; all they have to do is walk into a frat party and they'll have 10 takers willing to grind with them and hook up with them. All I want is to hook up. I'm doing well academically, but I can feel my focus dwindling and my motivation crumbling. To see smiling faces holding hands all around me is disheartening. All I want is to have a girl by my side who wants to be around me and hold my hand. All I want is to go to a party and hook up with a girl- just once. I want to know what it's like. I'll never ask for anything else in life, but I want to experience the thrill of sexual contact with another girl while here. I'm feeling increasingly hopeless about the situation."

Maybe I've had no luck with guys bc I'm not a Manic Pixie Dream Girl who's in love with faeries and unicorns. Maybe my INTJ personality shows through and guys recognize that and avoid me. Maybe it's bc I'm plain bordering ugly and still fat (but changing) whilst having the gall to be black on top of it. Maybe my standards are too fucking high. I don't know. It's weird bc I've never even wanted a boyfriend before. Ever. I had a (rather intense) crush freshman year, but that didn't pan out. I couldn't even talk to the guy bc I'm super shy and I was extremely unattractive. All of a sudden, though, as I'm taking some time off from Cornell, I have this urge to be with someone. But then I can't? I'm just undesirable and I have a feeling I'll be alone forever and truly become the cat lady I've always aspired to be. :/"

I think I've been suffering from ADD/ADHD for as long as I can remember, and it's gotten pretty bad since freshmen year of high school.  I can't seem to focus on anything, my mind wanders when my professors speak, I see words on pages but they don't seem to make any sense to me, I can't remember the last time I was motivated by school, I'm forgetful, and I procrastinate like crazy.  

It's discouraging feeling my mind deteriorate while my parents refuse to believe I might have a problem, having every conversation about it end with my dad sternly saying that there's nothing wrong.  

Now that I'm eighteen and I'm relatively independent I've decided to figure this out regardless of what they think.  I just don't know where to start..."
3512,2015-02-02 23:53:16,"4638
I used to only jokingly claim that missed opportunities are the stuff of life.  Now I feel like I've had a little too much life.  It's only a week into the semester and I'm having trouble finding reason to get up in the morning.  Shit, I mean...damn the words are hard to find. This isn't some goddamn novel where a happy ending drops out of the sky.  Every story ends in silence. And solitude.  Shit I'm so alone."
3513,2015-02-02 23:35:17,"4637
I'm sorry for how things ended. I'm warm towards everyone - genuinely so - but the moment I feel that real spark, I cannot help but recoil; it's defensive, I don't want to get hurt. I'm acceptant of things now, talking to other people and such, as I imagine you are too. I go to bed, content, thinking I've moved on, only to awaken from a dream visited by you and you alone. I wish this feeling would dissolve. But I more so wish that we were together, xoxo"

To the guy who sits across the aisle from me and makes eye contact with me before/throughout bio lecture. I'm debating asking you out for coffee. 
I just don't know if it's weird since I don't even know your name."
3516,2015-02-02 23:09:21,"4634
I've spent three out of four years at Cornell, and socially I have nothing to show for it. My few ""friends"" are superficial at best and I've been forced to break up with the love of my life, the best friend I've ever had -the one jewel from my time here- due to circumstances out of our control. I just want May to come so I can move on from this abysmal chapter of my life."

You're going to graduate in four months and go back to your country for good. I wonder if I'll have the courage to tell you I love you before that?"
3521,2015-02-02 23:45:34,"4629
You totally seem like a great guy!  AND I’M SO GOSH DARN SHY I DON’T KNOW HOW IN THE WORLD I’D TRY TALKING TO YOU AGAIN.  At least I’m feeling shy right now.  Or antisocial.  I don’t know.  

Ugh.  

I mean, I might do it, if I get the chance at the right moment.  But who’s to say when the right moment exactly is?  I think any moment might be the right moment, which is slightly upsetting cause I’ve let a few pass by, especially in dining halls… :) BUT it’s a new semester!  A new beginning!  New opportunities!  Maybe I’ll try to think less and just act, because I think thinking incubates fears, which then inhibit actions.  And I’m a thinker.  So maybe I’ll try to think less?????????????????  

Also, I have to say, you have an amazing smile.  

If this may pertain to you, or maybe even if it doesn’t, talk to that gal (or person) you think might like you!  Don’t think too much!  Ask her to go ice-skating or maybe to grab a bite to eat.  Or maybe she’ll have mustered up enough non-thinking courage herself and say something more to you.  Maybe these kinds of interactions aren’t all that rare.  Maybe you’ll both stop posting confessions and just talk to each other!"

I never like going out with my friend because she's 1000x more beautiful than I am and I know when we go out all the guys are going to flock to her and pretend like I don't exist. I love her she's my best friend but she wants to go out with me and I'm running out of excuses for getting out of it. I don't know what to do anymore I can't tell her because she'll stop being my friend. What should I do? Keep making excuses?"

I don't plan on having sex with him anytime soon because of my own personal philosophy. And that fact that he understands and respects makes him all the more special. I know sex isn't everything in a relationship. Yet it still worries me. What if it's not just me?"

I am in my early 20's and I've never had a boyfriend or even kissed a guy for that matter.  I really look forward to having a boyfriend and even a family one day but it's not like I say that when I talk to guys because I know that would turn them away.  I feel like something's wrong with me.  I think part of the problem is that my parents put a lot of pressure on me to get a boyfriend a few years ago.  It made me extremely nervous and now every guy I talk to I think about them as a potential boyfriend and I make myself nervous.  Sometimes I choke up and other times I'm fine but that nagging thought is always there and I feel weird about it.  I feel like I have a hard time being myself.  I also feel like guys aren't really interested in me. Maybe I'm just oblivious or maybe something's wrong with me. I don't really know what I'm doing wrong."
3539,2015-02-01 18:25:11,"4611
I've seen people go in and out of ""relationships"", and it's sad to realize what they had didn't work out..but I guess that just means it takes two very special people to actually fall in love, slowly, step by step, creating their own legacy without even realizing it. A great love is born, and carefully nurtured."
3540,2015-02-01 18:28:13,"4610
A good friend of mine from high school wants to try to start up a relationship with me. The problem is, we go to different schools, so we'd be starting long distance and building on nothing. I'd never get to take her out to dinner, or hold her in my arms, or even just hang out with her. I don't have a lot of faith in long distance, especially if the relationship has never been or may never be anything else.

I really like her, though. And I also value our friendship quite a bit. I know this isn't really a confession, but what should I do to avoid hurting her?"
3541,2015-02-01 18:55:15,"4609
I hate the popularization of memes so much. Once upon a time they were fun little jokes shared in a free and spontaneous environment, but now they're churned out by the great 9Gag Reddit Factories by the truckload. What's worse, with this quantity comes a MASSIVE drop in quality, to the point where things that used to make me smile now make me grimace. I am seriously considering just unfriending everyone that posts terrible image macros on facebook. Just stop, no one thinks you're funny."
3542,2015-02-01 18:41:16,"4608
To all the people out there who are having a bad/sad/weird day today: I hope you feel much better soon! You can overcome."

I fell for you, against my will, just before you graduated and moved to another state.  And it's all wrong because I'm with someone else.  I told him and it killed him.  A piece of me left with you, and I don't have the strength to try to go and get it back, when my natural impulse is to just let you keep it.  Keep it as a souvenir, under your rug, where even you don't know it's there.  Even you don't know you have that piece of me.  You and I will never speak again."
3544,2015-02-01 18:48:19,"4605

Over time, I've grown distant from people who I used to be close with.  It hurts to think about good times you had with people you barely talk to now.  Not sure if it's better to forget about them and appreciate the friendships I do have now, or try to reconnect with them in the hopes of attaining a semblance of the closeness we used to have."

Continuation of 4471.
Saw you with him again. Of course you looked beautiful and graceful as always even drunk. I don't know anyone else who can be cute sexy brilliant and beautiful at the same time. I even considered talking to you but again, he was all over you. He must know how amazing you looked because me and all the guys standing around me couldn't stop staring at you. I wish you could see you like I do. There is no way he sees you for who you are, otherwise you'd be his by now. I know this is wrong, but I enrolled in a class I found out you'd be in. I just want to talk to you."

I have been having a rough junior yr.. Last semester, i started off with the notion of dropping out all bc of someone. This someone was so, so important to me to the point that i would cry myself to sleep. We havent spoken since last summer ended yet he is the only person i wake up thinking about and go to sleep. I have been wanting to text you for the longest yet, the notion that the phone works both ways hinders me. I always remind myself of that. This semester is now the battle against myself. I am no longer battling with feelings or emotions about someone, but, i find myself constantly battling against myself. I keep thinking that am not an efficient student and not even smart enough. I study SO SO much to get the grade that someone else just studies for like a day. 
Hard yr. REALLY hard."
3553,2015-01-31 00:01:36,"4596
I finally found her. And it's amazing. It's like I haven't been living on Earth. After years and years of disappointment and heartbreak, I once again came to the inevitable conclusion that there is NO amount of failure that trying can't fix. I see so much heartbreak on this page. Keep trying, fellow Cornellians. If you're kind and you work hard, amazing things WILL happen. You WILL find her/him. And your job. And your city. And your life."
3554,2015-01-31 00:33:38,"4595
I get that you realized that you were happier with another guy, but the fact that you found him while still with me hurts. The fact that you kept me hanging for over a month, while all i wanted was some honesty hurts.  The fact that you just decided to let me know you were in a new relationship and I was just an ex through a f*cking text message hurts.  You put me through all this and never even apologized.  When did you become so uncaring?"
3555,2015-01-31 00:12:39,"4594
I'm a freshman and I've known this girl for at least 5 years, she went to the high school a town over from me. She's perfect in every way except one: she's in a long distance relationship. I'm madly in love with her, seeing her makes my day a million times better. We got very flirty after a night out, but that quickly ended since I couldn't get myself to try and make her cheat. I'm waiting for the day for her to be single, but in the meantime I don't know what to do. We're so close and all I want is to be with her, and I know she knows that because every time I get drunk I tell her. I just wish she would break up with him already and give me a chance."

One time I blacked out during O-week and I ran around a frat naked and stole one of the brother's bed sheets from his room to cover myself when I came to and realized I had no clothes on.

I'm considering something I call ""Operation Bad Dream""-- it's where I never come back to Cornell and never speak to anyone here again, effectively treating the last two and a half years like one long, bad dream. All those rejections and failures and those awful things my ""friends"" have said and done to me over the years would have never actually happened. If anyone cared, they'd probably start treating me like a human being. Who knows where I will end up! As long as it's not here..."
3559,2015-01-31 00:18:45,"4590
I don't know what is wrong with me. I just feel like I have nothing. I'm so isolated its painful. I just curl up and cry at nite. I've started listening to commercials on hulu because it makes me feel like other people are with me. I don't know what to do anymore. I don't want to live this."
3560,2015-01-31 00:03:46,"4589
This is my last semester at Cornell. I need to go out and experience Ithaca and meet new people. If I randomly come up to you and talk I'm not hitting on you I'm not trolling I'm not trying to be creepy. I just want more friends :) 

See ya soon :)"
3561,2015-01-31 00:44:49,"4588
Hey you,

You told me that I thought about us too much and that's why we didn't work out. I didn't believe you at first, but now I think maybe you were right. Now that there's no ""us"" to worry about, I realize that I really did have feelings for you, and not just the friendly feelings that I persuaded myself I had. I know it hasn't been long since everything ended, but I've spent every moment thinking about you. It's so hard to give you space when all I want to do is chat you up on Facebook and make sure you're doing alright. 

I know this is not how you feel, but I can't think of anything I would've rather done with the little free time that I had, that we spent together watching videos and talking 'til god knows when in the morning. I'm sorry that we ended so bitterly and I'll miss not being able to stumble into your room for no reason and ending up staying for hours.

You deserve so much more than a girl who could never make up her mind, and I hope you will find her soon. Maybe then we can go back to the friendship that we started with, that I cared so much about, that I was so scared to lose."
3562,2015-01-31 00:58:50,"4587
I am terrified of interviewing. For technical interviews, either you know the stuff or you don't. But for behavioral interviews, the answers are so open ended. I know from the bottom of my hard that I am a great, honest, worker who can resolve issues, but I have trouble of thinking of specific examples in my life. I also feel extremely pressured to get a good internship this summer. My other friends from high school still aren't taking their internship search that seriously. I am glad I am ahead of the game, but sometimes I think the environment at Cornell makes me unnecessarily stressed about it. I just hope my first behavioral interview goes well so I'll be more relaxed and confident in the future, and I also hope I get a decent internship.."

Well, Cornell, it is remarkable how in all my time here I have never made friends close enough to discuss things that weigh me down. I've discussed other people's problems with them but haven't been comfortable enough to share the worst ones. There are things we are destined to bear alone perhaps.

Leaving home was awesome for many reasons. I felt a little like young Harry Potter, for whom Hogwarts was the first place he could truly belong to and call his own. (Yes, to all you Cornell haters, you're going to miss it when you are gone). It's not that I had a rough chidhood, quite the opposite. It's just that I had to parent myself way too often. My dad was alright, but my mom was...is weird. She is this weird mix of orthodox religious and narcissist that she has trouble making and keeping friends and views pretty much all people with disgust (not religious enough) or pity (oh they care so much about non-god stuff). I don't hate her, but I gave up on having a close relationship with her long ago. Discussing people from school would just lead into a discussion of whether they made straight A's or their parents' denominations. I Had to get perfect A's too, else how would I do well? No summer camps or extra jobs or sports, just work on your studies. She drove away all the dates I brought home by being generally crazy to them. 

Well I'm at Cornell now, and I think I'll do well for myself. I realized after coming here that I did inherit her traits (an insufferable conviction that I'm better than other around me, for example), and I have worked on becoming a better person and developing healthy relationships with others. My current SO will probably not meet her more than a few times, as this one is too dear to me.

I know many of you have had a hard time coming here, many of you escaped worse lives than this. I hope you find it in you to not hate others because of things you have seen, but to become better people due to all these experiences. I just wanted to get this off my chest. 

(As for that SO, rings may be involved soon if you get what I mean)"
3565,2015-01-28 12:46:54,"4584
I think I am straight. So far, I have only been with guys. And I definitely like it, no questions there. But a part of me keep wondering what it would be like to be with a girl. Not just for the sex, but for the whole enchilada... the conversations, the flirting, the relationship drama. All of it. I have never been completely sexually attracted to any girl I know, which is good because I wouldn't ever want to hurt my friends. But sometimes, looking at a really beautiful or interesting looking girl, I can't help but wonder. At the same time, I feel scared that I will be rejected by a gay girl for being a poser. It's not like I want to be one of those straight girls who just want an ""experience"" in college, just to sound cool or bohemian or any such crap like that, but I am scared to come across as that sort of person. That being said, it would be nice if I did find people out there who are confused about themselves, like me.... sigh"

I'm working for my friend's Dad over winter break. Over the first week, I just realized he has an unreasonable and explosive temper. He constantly yells and belittles everyone around him, but no one stands up to him because he's the boss and they're afraid of being yelled at and being publicly shamed. Ugh. The worst part is that I can't avoid him after work because I'm living with him and his son. I can't wait to be out of here. For now, I'm avoiding any interaction with him as much as possible for the next 2 weeks. I can't wait to be out of here."

My older brother and sister are fraternal twins. I know that they're committing incest, but I'm scared to confront them about it or tell my parents. Should I tell them to stop or should I bother tattling on them? I don't want to hurt them and I don't want to judge them. After all, they're entitled to love each other and have sex. But when it's not safe sex, there's a chance they'll give birth to a demonic bastard child and I'll be that thing's uncle. I know for a fact that they don't use condoms or any contraceptives. What do I do fellow Cornellians? What do I doooooo?"

I have a crush on this really nice and cute guy  I met in my bio class last semester. He is funny and caring and always well-dressed, and once we started talking we became pretty close. Too close, since he placed me right in the friend zone.

This guy spent all of fall semester trying to get some other girl, and somehow I ended up being the comforter person whenever things didn't turn out well. Towards the end of it all, he finally got over it and admitted she wasn't gonna date him - but instead of noticing the girl that was right next to him, he decided he still wasn't over his ex back home. Now, I'm still the comforter person over thousands of miles because she doesn't want long distance and he's still fucking heartbroken.

I'm still gonna wait for him, but sometimes, I want to smack his silly face until he realizes I like him."

As a result of all the plane accidents in the past years and my parents flying to an Asian country in the next few months, we sat down and talked about what would ever happen in the event that their flight should go down and I would be on my own. Even though it was all hypothetical and said with the best intentions so that I would know what to do if I were truly on my own, I couldn't bear to sit through the whole conversation. When we finished I cried in my room for about 30 minutes over the possibility that I someday I might be without my parents.

I know that at times we find our parents annoying, overbearing, and heck they  make mistakes too, but love and cherish your parents."

I don't want to date at Cornell. I'm a guy who's still in love with my female best friend (of 8+ years) from high school that I'm in constant contact with and always see over breaks. Why just date someone, tell them everything about you, and then have the dump you in a matter of months? 

And to that best friend: we are close to being on the same page. We openly say how we worry for each other when we're apart, and how neither of us have found someone who can do the things we have (already) for each other. We understand each other in ways that no one else does. We're each other's other halves, and you're on the brink of realizing it, too."
3584,2015-01-27 14:47:38,"4565
I think about you most when I come home.  When I come back to the place we both call home.  When I'm at Cornell I'm distracted by so much and I don't really get to think about how I wish we could be together.  That's one reason why I'm looking forward to the spring semester and going back in January"
3585,2015-01-27 14:27:39,"4564
Just realized my best friend is extremely condescending and uses me for what I offer to her. Shit. I wish I never asked what was wrong, so I never found out. Now I need to slowly untwine her from my life so she doesn't notice until years pass and we haven't spoken. All this effort. Why couldn't you just care?"

Sometimes, I just feel like going naked on a camera and showing off my body online to hundreds and thousands of viewers (to fap to, most likely, I guess). I'm not an exhibitionist and my body is far, far away from perfect or even good, but I suppose it would be nice for someone to think of me as sexy, even if that person is a perv. Pathetic much!"

I deeply regret letting you go. I understand that you've finally come to terms with moving on, and I won't open up old wounds because I can't promise I won't hurt you again.

When pet owners can't talk about anything other than what their pets are doing that instant, and giving them constant undivided attention in the presence of other people, it's disrespectful, awkward, and annoying. What's even more annoying is referring to yourself as their mommy or daddy. You didn't give birth to your pet, and they're not substitutes for children. Stop talking to them as if they're people and then getting mad when they didn't understand the full extent of the convoluted comment you threw at them. They don't speak English. Or have a frontal cortex. That's the definition of psychotic behavior."

My mother hates me for not being a good enough student. It's stressed me out since I was a child--her drive for excellence. I think she's internally very angry at herself for not rising to the pinnacle of her conservative Indian patriarchy and for being treated like filth for being too dark by her own cunt of a mother. Seeing what she's been through--all the pain from years of abuse and a forced marriage to an abusive, uneducated and adulterous man--used to motivate me to excel for her sake. Then when things started to get bad earlier in college, I lost all her faith. I never expected to be coddled either in times of success or in times of failure. But her defeatist attitude and her biting insults have destroyed me. I know she looks at me as a failure and that I'll just be a repeat of my dad. I want to help her, but I can't. I hate myself for being so weak, stupid, and depressed."

I think I'm transgender and I'm terrified. I've had these feelings for a long time and recently they've only been getting stronger. I grew my hair out, wore dresses and makeup, and tried to act like a girl, but I just can't keep it up. I don't want to be transgender because my family is conservative and I know I won't have much of a future in the field I'm going into since it's also conservative. I want to set my body on fire, and I know that around 40% of trans people have attempted suicide and I should fight it, but honestly, I don't know what else to do."

So one of my classes was unexpectedly cancelled for next semester and all the other slots are filled. This is so unprofessional on Cornell's part.

Girls who think radio silence is a good way to show you're not interested in someone - it's not. Telling them is much more effective and more polite. Unless they've been annoyingly persistent. But if they've just messaged you, or they've done something sweet to show you they're interested and you do nothing, that's pretty rude. And more awkward if I run into you later. Just make up an excuse or say you don't feel the same way, it's infinitely better. You eliminate doubt, awkwardness, you show respect for someone's efforts and feelings..."

Whenever a friend or family member wrongs me in some way, I make a list of all shows, books, and movies they're interested in. I set out to find the plot and endings of all of the items on the list. Then I compile a second list containing the details I gained from my investigation. After cornering my unsuspecting prey in a room where he or she has no way out, I slowly let loose the details from my lips. They all resist in the beginning--trying in vain to drown out my words with their screams, covering my mouth with their lips, trying to find a way out of the locked room, etc. But in the end I always win. I always leave them lying on the floor trembling with indignation, sobbing in mental anguish, screaming WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT??? It's great fun."

I was in one of the buildings that no one usually goes to for studying during finals week. Well sometimes I get stressed and start singing shitty opera. I thought I was alone and was frisking along dancing ballet in the hallways and singing in my ""opera"" voice. I came to an open classroom and saw this dude studying inside. Well, after that I ran back to my classroom and didn't bother with the stress anymore.

I will finally say, though anonymously, how I feel. 

I feel alone... it's my fault. I have convinced myself that as I explore my sexuality, it's better if I am away from others. I don't want to hurt anyone, nor I want anyone to hurt me. That's why it has taken me so long to decide for one or the other, or for both. I don't want to go gay, and then regret it. I don't want to go straight, and regret as well. I don't want to go bi, and then have the social status of the guy that likes both because then I will get hit by both genders, and I don't want to have the need to reject/hurt someone just because I'm not interested anymore. I just hope I can finally get over this feeling; this thought that takes much space of my mind. I also hope I go for what I feel the most identified with, because once I come out, I can't go in."

I think my professor just cried a little bit when we said goodbye after her last OH. It is an intro level language class I took for fun. I first talked to her in September because someone very important to me and I are both struggling with our mental health problems and I missed a lot of homework. I was never the star in the class. I skipped classes. I didn't turn in all the homework or submit it late. I didn't have the best pronunciation. My grades were probably just a little above the mean. I only went to her OH a couple of times. And we were not even that close. Yet every conversation I had with her felt so sincere and personal. This is my fourth year at Cornell, but it is the first time I ever feel that I have some sort of connection with a professor, a professor who will remember me after the semester ends. When we were outside her office, she said ""I can't stand too close to you. I am already getting so sentimental."" And I saw tears in her eyes. I cried when I walked home. Thank you so much for a great semester. I learned, I made friends and I met a wonderful professor like you."

Finals week tip: 
Frustrated? Not able to focus? Don't reach for drugs. Orgasm on your study break(s). No, it doesn't make you a freak or weird. It's your body, it's natural. It'll clear your mind, reduce stress, and give you peaceful focus.

I currently live in a certain program house and absolutely hate it. Everyone is in a greek or cultural organization, and it's isolating when you are in neither. And I don't want to feel pressured to join these organizations just so that I can make friends, because they are almost like cults. People told me that the community was inclusive and that everyone got along, but I have never felt so lonely in my life. I wonder if it is because I do not fit their mold of what a minority individual should be like; because I do not partake in these organizations, people have even called me ""white-washed"" or worse. But I am every bit proud of my culture as them. When I go back home, I am isolated for the color of my skin, and here, in my own dorm, I am isolated for ""whiteness"" of my thoughts. I am not going to apply for the in-house lottery next semester, because I hate this feeling of being an outsider. Better to be unknown than to be ignored."

For the last four years I have been in love with a girl. She's the most beautiful girl, with a pretty smile and the kindest heart. However, she claims she's a lesbian, and though I've given her my heart and soul, even crying in front of her, professing my love through my tears and mucus that ran out of my nose, she still hasn't shown the same attraction towards me. But I know that she's straight, she has to be. Why would she even bother talking to someone like me? I don't want to sound entitled, but I've done so much for her, that she should at least go out with me for a girly drink. I want her to put away the flannel and the hiking boots and for one night just put on a nice dress for me and have a good time with me. I am sure that she'll see that she can be attracted to me, even if I am not a girl."

I was sexually assaulted my freshman year. It was by one of the first friends that I made in college. He was really drunk when it happened and when I told him no, he wouldn't let up.

I actually enjoyed talking to you that one night.

I realize this is as much my fault as yours, but I really wanna change that if you're willing to.

But I'm afraid that any attempt I make to spend time with you (which I did once and failed because you were busy) will be construed as me """"chasing"""" you.

I think the guy who posted the ""just shut up"" post has completely set off a total shit storm here but the dialogue is useful. I'd probably push back on the whole ""shut up"" side since dialogue is probably more constructive here than just listening; but I agree with the spirit of the argument that we might just listen to each other a bit. We're getting caught up in semantics. We seem to agree that discrimination towards minority groups exists but then we get caught up in the part about discrimination towards whites. This argument is not being properly framed. Let's move past this in a simple way. Let's first happily admit that there is such a thing as ""reverse"" racism or discrimination or however you want to call it. But now let's ask the drastic question of, yeah, so what? What does reverse discrimination or racism towards white people amount to? People are posting like it's some major thing that has effected so many people we all know. And what happened? Did someone call you a honky? Did they say you couldn't dance or rap or play basketball? Did they make fun of you for using street slang or wearing your baseball cap in a certain way? What is this racism towards white people? Did you get denied a job or a place in a university? Do you really know someone? How can you definitively verify that racism towards white people kept them from these goals? If all these minorities are getting all these jobs instead of white people, why do all these objective statistics suggest that unemployment rates are so much higher for racial groups? If some white guy told another white guy that he totally would've hired him if it hadn't been for racial quotas, do you think this guy didn't have a reason for perhaps lying about this? Isn't it a lot easier to just tell somebody you know or who knows someone you know that they didn't get a job because of something that they can't control rather than because they're not qualified? It seems to be the go to strategy for breaking up with people so it's a pretty common strategy. I'm from a working class background and the next white person I meet who didn't get a job because it was stolen by an immigrant or a black person filling a racial quota would be my first. So let's get those stats on all these white people who are being really tangibly blocked from something of value because of discrimination and then let's stop and think about what it is that any racism towards whites amounts to. Now, let's think about the actual data we have from studies where people who have ""black"" sounding names won't get called in for interviews. Let's look at the decades of extreme examples of police brutality directed towards people disproportionately because of race. Let's look at the minor things that blow your minor daily annoyances out of the water: the inability to get a taxi; the belief from others that you got your job or got into Cornell because of some racial quota; the distrustful looks directed towards you from store clerks; women clutching their purses as you approach; people constantly treating you like a race even when they're desperately on your side, keeping you from ever just being the same; police stopping you on a far more regular basis, treating you like a common criminal. Think about that next time you're ranting about your prelims or the walk up the slope; or the line at Starbucks; or the rude TCAT driver. I'm not trying to make your problems insignificant, but what I am saying is that white privilege is not some ticket to easy street: it is the ability to live without these daily annoyances. It is the ability to be born - if you are a man in an urban environment - without a 1 in 3 (!) chance of ending up in prison at some point in your life. Life is not easy just because you are white. It is only not made more difficult simply because of something you cannot control - something that is not random or just bad luck. As a last point, saying to white people that they should shut up and just listen and that they can't have an opinion is completely counterproductive. If they can't ever understand (not even a little) then what is the point of even talking about this? If we can't understand other people, we aren't human. We have evolved to be empathetic towards others and this allows us to take on the perspective of others; it allows for compassion. Some of us might utilize this property more than others, but it is there. We can't ever know 100% the feelings or experiences of another, but we can approach the other if we listen; if we discuss; if we relate these experiences to others. We have moved towards acceptance of homosexuals because (!) we all know homosexuals. They are our family members; our coworkers; our friends. We cannot segregate them into urban enclaves and only know them through parodies in the media. If we know more of those who differ -  if we force ourselves to get to know those who we view as an affront to our own beliefs - we will approach understanding in an imperfect sense. If you believe that half the country is stupid because they are conservative or liberal, then sit back and listen; get to know these people. People on both sides are intelligent and good and many of us are on either side because we were raised that way; not because it's right and we're smarter. Come on people."

To start off, I am a guy and I show I am as emotionally strong as anyone can be. I am also a person that cares a lot about others. As a first-year student, I have experienced things I haven't experienced in my entire life, and I know everyone goes through it (Not performing well in classes, perhaps). It is the reason why I always smile. I smile at everyone that passes by, whether or not I know the person. I try to be as supportive as possible, because helping simply makes me happy.

I am the type of guy that if I see you in an elevator with no headphones, I would ask ""Hey, how are your classes going?"" or ""How are you feeling?"". However, that's non-reciprocal. I see no one asking me how am I feeling or how am I doing. It could be that I show that I am always happy, but I want to tell that even though I show I am emotionally strong, I do have feelings and feel sad most of the times. Being away from my family has made me view the world in different ways, and appreciate everyone I had around me. 

I just can't wait till Finals' week is over so I can hug my entire family, that despite of how I do in school, is always there to support me."

I've always prized sexual compatibility in a relationship and desire it especially for the girl I would end up marrying. That's why whenever I'm about to enter a relationship, I always ask the girl if I can have sex with her before beginning the relationship to see if we're sexually compatible enough to even be in a relationship in the first place. The more sex we have and the more I like it, the more I know she's sexually compatible enough to be in a relationship with. Usually I have a 1-weekend test where I ask the girl if I can have sex with her Friday through Sunday night. If by the end of the weekend I'm happy and satisfied, we begin to date. Unfortunately, ever since I've begun proposing this sexual compatibility litmus test, I've been getting rejected more and more. Two of 8 girls I've asked out in the last semester have slapped me, 5 more said no and left, and the last one had sex with me but then stole money from my wallet and left Monday morning. The fuck!"

Sometimes it doesn't take that much time for me to do all my leadership roles and literally do more than the average student.

And sometimes it takes my all to get out of bed. To be able to focus and do one or two orgo problems while I feel a knot tied in my throat, wondering if I'll make it through the day, through the week, trying to motivate myself to move ahead, knowing that when I feel good again, I'll hate myself for how miserable I've been.

For those who write in the comments, I go to CAPS, I take my meds, I do what I need to do. I just wonder when this is going to stop.

I technically have PTSD. I hardly ever have the nightmares anymore, the bad dreams, the problems. But I still struggle with sadness. It just comes and slowly eats away at me, leaving me empty. And I always tell myself that maybe a successful semester will make me feel better. But then I get filled with sadness the week of a prelim. Or a final. And I get one STDev below the mean. And I lose the A that I worked so hard for.

I just wanna know when it will stop, and if it will mean that I'll never have a normal or happy life."""

Right before fall break I accidentally ran into a girl right in front of Statler as I was getting off the bus. As I looked over to see who I ran into to apologize I was immediately dumb struck as I saw how beautiful she was. I just put my head down and started walking to class and it happened she was going the same way. We walked awkwardly silent for a little while before she made some small talk, then as quickly as it started she had to go a different direction and I never saw her again. I think the thing I regret most this semester was not asking her what her name was. I'll take it as a learning experience I guess..."

""When I was 4, my younger brother died when our van burned down because my dad was too drunk to get him out.
When I was 9, my dad, who had spent the last four and a half years in prison and who had blamed my mother for everything that happened, returned only to kill her after dinner when I was watching cartoons.
Between the ages of 9 and 13, I lived in two separate foster homes where I was beaten, molested, and verbally abused day after day.
But apparently my hardships don't mean anything.  Apparently I should sit down and shut the fuck up because I've had a privileged life as a white male."

""I wish I FULLY understood and appreciated how amazing it is to be at Cornell University during my first year here. 

As a Senior, I JUST realized that this may be the last time when I'll be surrounded by thousands of people from all over the world, who are around my age, doing and studying amazing and wonderful things almost everyday!

Where and when can I just start conversation with someone at a bus stop, cafe, or dining hall only to discover that person is researching how to prevent aging in humans, a Division I track star, or swam with shark in the Galapagos? 

When will I be able to take ANY course I want to AND be taught by some of the world's best professors? 

Gosh, I wish I fully appreciated what I have here at Cornell before my senior year. All I can do is make the best of the next semester! In short, take advantage of every opportunity of everyday here. You'll be glad you did."""

Now that she is done with the semester and moved out (and I'm going abroad) I can finally say what has been going on. My roommate literally lives in our bathtub. It is the weirdest thing I have ever seen someone do... She literally has a hot plate and a hot water boiler in out bathroom so she can cook and make coffee/tea while she is in the tub. She even does her homework in it. It's the weirdest thing I have ever seen...."

I have been single for a year now. I was in a very unhappy relationship for a long time and breaking up felt like the right thing to do. I was convinced I was going to find someone soon and I will then have my share of happiness and togetherness I felt I deserved. I have had no luck till now. I like a guy in my class, atleast I did, but he turned out to be an arrogant person. I went out of my way to help him ( which I would have done for anyone ) but when I need help he always has reasons to not help me. He seems to be very friendly when he needs my help and at other times doesn't even acknowledge me. I tried hard to make myself believe that he is not that petty at this stage of life but turns out he is and now I have lost interest in him. His actions make me feel like he thinks I am way out of his league. I wish I still liked him though, would have given me something to hold on to, something to look forward to. Everything just feels empty now. I hope next semester will be better than this one"

""Oh my god Shut Up. Please, just Shut Up. Confronting racism would be so much easier if white people just knew how to shut up. You know how I learned how to shut up?  I had it slapped in my face that I *actually don't have a fucking clue* what I'm talking about when it comes to race because *I have never experienced racism*!!! Funny, right, how that works? And if I don't know what I'm talking, then maybe I should sit back and *listen*. I know, I know, crazy! Because as white people, no body ever told us that our opinions don't matter. It may be *crazy* but you should really try it some time, because fuck, if you listen to people of color talk about racism, you can learn how much anger and sadness they have built up inside of them, Anger and sadness inherited from centuries of brutal treatment of their ancestors. Anger and sadness at the abuse they experience on a daily basis. Anger and sadness because something as simple as walking into a room, or looking in the mirror, or walking. down. the fucking. street. could be a struggle for them. And if you sat back, listened, and sympathized with even an ounce of the anger and sadness they feel, then maybe you wouldn't be so fucking concerned that someone spraypainted a building. You wouldn't be so concerned that """"I experienced hardship too, so why can't we talk about me??"""" You wouldn't be so concerned that someone said they hate white people. BECAUSE WHEN THEIR PEOPLE ARE BEING SHOT DOWN IN THE STREET HOW COULD THEY NOT HATE WHITENESS? 
So fuck, let them be angry. Let them talk, and you just listen. Because, at most, it's an inconvenience for you. But when they are dying at the hands of the white supremacy you benefit from and perpetuate, the least you can do is inconvenience yourself. And what you really should be doing is risking all you got to make it stop."""

Last winter break, the guy I was involved with texted me every day, wanting to have long conversations with me and make us official when we came back. I winded up not going out with him for long when the semester came but at least there was some trial on his part. I know a month is a long time and a lot can change, but as the other guy showed, when you care about someone, contacting them is not so strenuous. Don't tell me we'll pick up where we left off when we get back. There's no way in my mind I can go through with that and feel right about it. I care about you too much now and if you don't care about me enough to even keep a somewhat regular contact over break, then it's just going to bite me in the ass even more. I can't be the fool who holds out hope because this situation is completely dismal and strange. I know I can go my break without hooking up with anyone else and I know I'm going to be thinking of you when you're 1,000 miles away. I wish you could do the same."

I want to meet more interesting people at Cornell. One of my dreams is to meet 1 or 2 English majors and become good friends with them and start some sort of rap group. I also want to meet more Art majors and make cool paintings and shit (have a few good ideas on paintings but not the skills to make them). Problem is I'm always stuck in Duffield scrambling to get an assignment done. Fucking fuck.

It's weird, because guys who invite me out, compliment me, buy me food, drive/carry me a few times a week and introduce me to their friends then drop off the face of the earth for a week or so.

""It seems absolutely crazy to me that all this has happened over the course of one year. In one year, I fell in love, lost a friend, matured in my sexuality, was heartbroken, tried a lot of drugs, fell in and out of depression, discovered my true friends, came to terms with my eating disorder, and talked someone out of committing suicide.

Unfortunately, all those experiences seem lost when I try to balance them with my academic career. It's so hard for me to get to intimately know my peers, to participate in the happens of everyday, and to lend myself to those who need me, when I have to turn in homework I dread doing. 

I'm not sure of my major anymore. I am barely scraping by with my grades. I am constantly questioning whether I should be on the streets protesting the disgusting police brutality, murder, and injustice of country is facing. I'm doing my best to not just """"say"""" I want to help, but actually do something, but it's hard when I have papers and tests and vocabulary to memorize.

I know that a world-class education from this school will give me the means by which I can help the world. Knowledge is key in our battle and taking the time to truly educate myself is the first step in preparing myself to support those who could use my help. 

But aren't all those times I hold my friend when she cries important too? When I spend an hour talking to the homeless man because he lost his job and family and just wants someone to have a conversation with? When I run and get coffee for my friends who are anxious about a test? Is it okay for me to risk making a deadline if it means I brighten someone else's day?

I am all over the place. I'm trying to experience each day to the fullest but I also want to build a foundation for greatness. I feel I am being pulled in so many directions and I have no idea what path to follow. I just want the best for everyone. I have a big heart and big dreams, but I sometimes wonder if I'll even graduate."

She just started laughing at me. Not to be mean or anything. She's a pretty sweet person. But I think in her head it was just so ridiculous because I'm nowhere near as attractive or popular as her. Keeping in mind this was the first time I asked out a girl, my self-esteem just took a nosedive. It's one thing to get rejected. It's another for it to be taken as a complete joke.

""Here is a poem in honor of Christmas and Finals.

Trapped in the Tower

""""Fa la la la
Heard up in McGraw 
The soundtrack to my nightmare
As the Chimemasters block the stair

I am the pumpkin speared on top
I'm trapped and can't be stopped
The image illustrates hell
As I've been swallowed by Cornell

I watch the hordes of nerds
walking to finals in form of herds
they've done the blacking out
and now there's no backing out

do I want to be walking to a final?
it's almost worse than a tap on the spinal
but no, i'm trapped in the tower
and my fate has exercised its power

i'm doomed to become the tower hermit
for as long as frostbite and chimes will permit
I am the nightmare of Christmas carols
as my life becomes frighteningly sterile

I get jiggity by myself
as I watch the drunkards from my shelf
I am the ghost of Christmas's past
as I grow cold far too fast

independent we stand, independent we fall
but from my perch I have seen it all
I am Cornell""""

GOOD LUCK ON FINALS AND MERRY CHRISTMAS. I LOVE CORNELL"""

""I hate myself. The way that I entrench myself in unnecessary sadness is not only toxic to my well being, it brings others to my shitty pit as well. I recognize my parasitic qualities, but I can't get myself to stop. I don't mean to do any harm. I don't fucking know. Being miserable is like a comfort blanket for me sometimes. That and I just don't feel like I deserve to be okay, let alone happy. Maybe that's why I get myself into these situations. Maybe I want people to hate me? I just don't know. This is all fucking hard and the fact that I am at Cornell and away from my parents means that I can do whatever I want to myself and that scares me.

 On days like this, I miss my ex like hell. He used to insult me, beat me and force me to do sexual acts with him. It was fucking terrible, but it was secure. As long as I didn't say anything about those things, he would stay with me. In a way, he felt like exactly what I deserved. Exactly. Sometimes I wished that he would get to a point where he would beat me so hard that he would kill me, since I couldn't get myself to do it. I miss it.

I find it sooo seductive when guys stop and hold a conversation with me even when other people or life in general says to just say hi and move on.  The conversation can be about classes or nothing really at all, but just the fact that you stopped makes me feel so special.  Tbh, sometimes I catch myself thinking ""why are you doing this if you're not into me, just stop it, it's confusing,"" but then I realize that I'm grateful that they're at least good friends, even if they won't be anything more. But it still hurts a little bit knowing that you won't be anything more..."

""As an international graduate alumnus, I hesitate to open my wallet when I receive emails asking for donation. Here is why:

1) No scholarship. I had a significantly good application, good interviews and stuff. I got admitted, got a top-tier job and contributed to the school's stats. I know, I couldn't get without Cornell, so thanks for that. But I paid for this education (out of my own pocket, not daddy's). 
2) 7.25% per year in interest for my student loans. Enough said. 

If at least I had the same few thousands my American colleagues had with a worse application, I would give back so much more. Also, It seems that """"diversity scholarships"""" is only for American Black, American Women and American LGBT, but they forget the Asians, Latinos, foreign women, etc, etc... If I ever become rich, I'll definitely donate, but I'll make sure these """"unseen"""" population get their scholarship.

Beauty-based sexual attraction is not well-suited to modern society. I understand the evolutionary reason for it: a long time ago, it was beneficial to choose a good-looking mate because good looks were indicative of health. But today, everyone is healthy. And I don't mean that in an insensitive way; I'm just saying that modern medicine can overcome most problems. Unless there's something like a genetic disorder that runs in the family, there's very little reason to judge someone as a poor mate based on their health. So why does sexual attraction based on beauty still exist? I know a lot of fantastic people who I would date except for the fact that I'm not sexually attracted to them in the slightest. I might be shallow, but sexual attraction should not be underestimated as a key part of a functioning relationship. I just can't be with someone whose appearance doesn't get me excited. But from my experience, appearances indicate absolutely nothing about a person. Nada. The most beautiful person could be a demon on the inside, and the ugliest person out there could be an angel. It's a problem I wish we could eliminate. Think of the possibilities if a person whose personality worked well with yours would always be a good candidate for a relationship! It's just a bummer is all I'm saying."

I've been through hell. During my sophomore + junior year I lived in several foster homes and went to countless hours of family and personal therapy after dyfs became involved because of my abusive parents. There is a point where the pain of depression becomes so chronic that it manifests itself into physical pain...like someone is holding your heart and squeezing as your lungs are gasping for breath. But I'm past that now, with a fighting spirit stronger than most. My gpa is terrible but I know deep in my heart I'm an exceptional student and person. I just need someone to believe in me. As decision day gets closer and closer, I remember the TA who went out of his way to give me a tour of the school...the red haired girl who recommended I try the dairy bar...the professor whose class was delightfully engaging...and the stranger who gave me directions because he could see I was clearly lost even walking with a map in front of me. I still have that map. I keep it in my pocket everyday to remind myself of my dreams. Thank you Cornellians, particularly hotelies, for making my visit a once in a lifetime experience- regardless if I get accepted or not. I just hope hotel admissions reads my application rather than trash it after one lookat my gpa. If I get in, you can expect great thing from me, I promise. I just need a chance...."

I've known my girlfriend for 5 years now and we're going strong. What I've noticed though is how much she treats me like she's my mother--incessantly doting on me, scolding me when I do something stupid, picking out my clothes for me, making sure I exercise and eat healthy, making sure my grades are up, getting work experience, etc. Having been orphaned early in life and gone through a string of abusive and negligent foster homes, I can honestly say that she's a godsend. I love every minute that she spends with me--even when she pesters me to death. I never respond in anger and always take it in stride. A lot of guys I know have said that she's nagging and clingy and that I'm less of a man for putting up with this behavior--that it's an unhealthy relationship. But it's not. I love how much she cares for me and I have not sacrificed a shred of my masculinity. I'm confident, I speak up for myself and my close friends if one of us is being bullied, and I plan on fully providing for myself and her financially. So eat shit haters.

""Once all this darren wilson and eric garner thing dies down (which will, like it did with Trayvon Martin), all this """"college social justice"""" warriors will go back to their everyday life, feeling better about themselves, and feeling """"they did something.""""

However, the lives of many """"lower class"""" citizens will remain unchanged, regardless of how much you protest, most of the people (not all of course) are doing it because the media brought attention to it, and because of """"peer pressure."""" However, if you really cared about black lives, why I dont see all the people fiercely protesting and yelling about these injustices in the local YMCA, or in the poor black (or hispanic) communities helping kids out who dream with education, yet cant get it. Not only because of lack of opportunities, but lack of education provided by both their parents and their schools.

If all this effort in """"police brutality"""" protests was put into educating and inspiring the kids who truly need it, we would be living in a different america by now, but hey that is how college kids work.

I just want to invite all of you who really believe in the causes you are fighting for, to not only """"protest"""" but take action in the communities that NEED your help. because change doesnt start at the top, but the bottom. The situation in these communities cries for help. Heck, while living in there, I was more scared of my own peer than the police, but thankfully I got the opportunity to come here, and now every time i go back, I go to talk and tutor the kids who are going through the same situation i went through.

I am in no way telling you to stop protesting, but to also be proactive in helping to change this place from its roots.

 Also, i have noticed that a lot of people are very reactive when it comes to this subject, which then leads to just a """"heated argument"""" (more like yelling) from both sides with nothing discussed or changed. I just want to say something: """"hate only breeds more hate."""" If you are not willing to break the cycle of hate, no one will. So i tell you, please, unite and cooperate, accept different view; understand and discuss; dont just go around yelling your opinion while covering your ears. If you dont listen, the other person wont and nothing will be changed. If we want change we need to unite  and work together, not ake people work for each other, only then things will get done.

Finals week is wearing away on everyone including yours truly. Hence the slow postings as of late. So I've put together a little survey to gauge how the page is currently used, as well as what direction the Mods need to take it. Your feedback will help us continuously improve Cornell Confessions and allow us to post more frequently. Thanks in Advance!

Good luck with finals! Remember, we don't do things because they're easy; we do things because they're hard!

Also, if you're feeling especially overwhelmed this is just a reminder that Cornell University has services such as EARS/CAPS that provide an open and non-judgmental space to work through the host of feelings of stress that come with or are exacerbated by finals week.

I've been on several dates now that underwent a 180 when the girl found out I didn't believe in God, and I've had a couple of relationships where that was a minor issue at first that ultimately led to our parting ways. And I really really liked the girls, but people just can't tolerate their most fundamental beliefs about existence being questioned. And I don't blame them. But I took astrophysics and I have a brain predisposed to skeptical inquiry and the scientific method and I just cannot believe in supernatural things. I wish I could. Because I really like you.

So I was talking to my little brother over break. I asked him why he wanted to be a doctor and he basically rehashed the same shit everyone says: ""I want to help"". I just laughed. What's he gonna do? Grab his bag of help and sprinkle a little help here and a little help there until the entire hospital is just fucking daisies and sunshine? Get real kid. I KNOW why I want to be a doctor. I want the money, the bitches, the cars, the penthouse in Manhattan, the premium-Grade A Colombian cocaine, the prestige, and the POWER. Above all. The Power. Being able to whisper into the ear of the girl your screwing: ""I'm an M.D. I'm an M.D."" over and over again is just amazing. That. And the ability to choose any mail-order bride I want from India to make mom happy and proud. The end."

Having been raised and homeschooled in an insular, but very liberal household, I've grown accustomed to a lot of things that the average American kid isn't used to. Coming to Cornell has made me realized how grateful I am for the way I was raised. But it's also been difficult to transition from an open and free paradise to the standards of a dull and restricted society. A few examples: My house is in a nudist colony. That means everyone's required to enter naked. My parents always had sex with the doors open. Either my brother or I could walk in any time and observe (We didn't though because that would be pretty weird). My parents, brother and I would all smoke pot together during the Holidays. They let me get my first tramp stamp when I was 9. I lost my virginity when I was 10. I got a dick piercing at the age of 11. I first got hammered with my mom when I was 14. I participated in my first orgy when I was 15. Having had a productive, yet pleasurable lifestyle up to this point, I find college campuses pretty boring. The most interesting thing that happens up here are those frat parties. But even they get repetitive. Sigh...I miss home."

""Whenever I hear a fellow Cornell student or a solider or really anyone who has moved away talk about how much they miss they family, and how they can't wait to go home for the holidays to see their family, and family this, and family that.... I really don't get it. I can't tell if all of them are serious or of it's just a very politically correct thing to say. I used to think it was the latter but I'm starting to think it's the former. You've lived with your family your ENTIRE life, you've shared a house with the same people for many long years, you lived in the same stupid place, you've had no control over your life for most of it, assuming you're around late teens to early 20s, and yes they loved you and supported you, but how the heck did you not dream of new places and advenures to discover on your own, and be your own person. The second you move away, you get nostalgic and can't wait to go back to that prison where your identity has been overdefined over years and years? I don't understand that at all.

I moved to America on my own when I was teenager, then I joined the military and traveled around the world for the next 6 years of my life, seeing things most people wouldn't dream of seeing. Now I am a student at Cornell and this great American adventure continues. My life got exponentially better after I left the boring place I grew up in. I didn't miss my parents or siblings or old acquantances once. I called my family a few times a year out of courtesy, but that was it. New things, new adventures, new places, that's what life is about. It's how I've always seen it. That's how civilization started and got to this point. That's what built this country - people saying """"screw you all, I'm moving to a different continent"""". When I was a solider, I would constantly hear my brothers and sisters in arms talk about their families, home, how much they missed them... I never understood that. Never. I was always respectful, but I thought I was in some way superior to them, because I didn't feel this way. And when people asked me if I missed my family (that happened a LOT) I would usually respond - no, I didn't move half a world away to miss my family. And they wouldn't really understand... Now I'm at Cornell and I hear more of the same. So I'm starting to think there is something seriously wrong with me. And in most cases, people didn't even move to a different country. I just can't fathom how you weren't dying to get out there and live your life, have some sense of adventure, stop thinking about all the things you were born with and get some new things..."""

I know she's really bad with long distance relationships, she's cheated in the past. I think thats one of the reasons I've never truly told her about how I felt. I don't want things to be weird. But at the same time I'm hopeful that if I did tell her, then maybe we could make it work.

I have this evergrowing fear of that phone call, one year from now, two, three, whenever it might be.. that she's engaged. And its not to me. She brings out the absolute best in me. And I like to think that I make her a better person too. 

When you see all that shit in the movies or in books about the one that got away, she is the epitome of that for me... But what can I do? To sound cliche yet again, I can't imagine her not in my life. So do I take my own advice I give to others, and feel the fear and do it anyway? Knowing that I tried?

I feel incapable of deciding what to think about the events in Ferguson. I've heard all about the evidence, and the only thing I'm getting out of it is a sense of debilitating confusion. There is conflicting evidence and missing evidence galore: why were Brown's clothes never turned in to be used as evidence? What happened to the DNA test on the gun? Why is every witness report totally different? People ask me for my opinion, and the only answer I can give is that the case was decided on no evidence at all. In so many ways, it reminds me of the Pistorius case: one of the witnesses is the perpetrator, and the investigators made such a mess of things that we're left with nothing. It's two-sided: you need to take a leap of faith no matter what side you're defending. And yet people seem so sure of what happened. Fox News runs headlines such as ""Officer's Story Indicates That Brown's Actions Led To His Death"" while other headlines ask ""Why Does Everyone Believe The Lies of A Racist Cop Who Has So Much To Lose?"". And while the media and my friends pretend there's only one way to see the issue, I stand here refusing to take a side. Because I can't support or condemn without an understanding of what happened.

But I do seek out and appreciate help when I'm going through dark cycles of thought and I get lost in a depression. But lately I've come to realize how shitty humans can be to each other. You really can't expect mercy from anyone in this world. The only person you can rely on is yourself. All that matters in this pitiful existence is somehow achieving a position of power in which you can protect yourself from the insults and actions of others. I've learned my lesson. Love and loyalty are both traits to be exploited by the strong, and should not be espoused by the weak."

And while the social scene is a big part of what we do (we are, by definition, a social sorority), a sorority is so much more than that. I know this confession is going to get a lot of eye rolls, and maybe some hate in the comments below, but the sisterhood thing is real. I thought it was bullshit before I joined, way up until I started living in the house, but there IS a bond and we would honestly do anything for a girl in need. 

Also philanthropy. Lots of philanthropy."

""From what I've seen, Cornellians are usually sympathetic towards others - they fight against sexual harassment, racism, and poverty, even when it doesn't pertain to them directly.

And from most people I've talked to here, they're incredibly understanding of their friends having anxiety problems, depression, bipolar disorder, 

But the disorder I've always struggled with I can never bring up to anyone... ADHD.  I wasn't on medication until very recently, and it doesn't help much academically besides keep me more organized. I take the same amount of medication on a Saturday in bed as I do for a Thursday night prelim. 

And yet, everyone I've talked to here thinks ADHD is a psuedo-disorder to prescribe stupid kids with """"performance enhancing drugs."""" I've heard so many times """"Oh I'm diagnosed with ADHD too after I couldn't focus on my work. But I mean that's everyone right?""""

NO, it's not. ADHD, at least for me, is a constant daily struggle to be a normal, functional human being. It's being miles slower at every simple physical process. It's having to constantly remind myself to not leave my wallet somewhere.

It's forgetting someone's name even though you've known them for weeks or even years and know all about them. It's forgetting what someone said 3 seconds ago and appearing disinterested even though you really care. 

Medication really does help night-and-day in many of those social and organizational aspects.  But if I was to tell anyone that, they would jump the gun to the cognitive bias of ADDERALL--> ULTRA-CONCENTRATION ON TESTS-->CHEATING."

""So there's this girl I'm kinda crushing on. We were hanging out in kind of a small group last Thursday night, and we were flirting with each other pretty obviously for most of the night. Then Friday night came, and we had plans to go to the same party. I even texted her to make sure she'd be there, and indeed she showed up.

But then she kind of ended up in another group talking to people. Not wanting to seem too clingy, I moved onto the dance floor--the night was young, and I figured there'd be plenty of time to be with her. But before I knew it, this other girl was all over me. We started making out, and kept at it for a while. It was very visible, and this girl's best friend even made a comment to me about it (neither positive nor negative) the next day.

I also saw the girl the next day, and maybe it was just me, but she seemed to ignore me. She still talked to me, but I had to initiate the conversation, and she didn't seem as interested in carrying on a conversation with me as she had been on Thursday night.

If you're reading this, I'm pretty sure you know who you are. I honestly don't know if you were even upset by my actions--it could just be my own self-centered imagination playing tricks on me--but if you were I'm sorry. I mean, if I had been flirting with someone, then that person texted me to make sure I'd be at a party, I'd be upset if the person then proceeded to hook up with someone else all night.

Anyway, this is rambly and there's a good chance I'm misjudging some of her attitudes. Maybe she didn't even like me in the first place (although Thursday night involved some of the more blatant flirting I've ever been a part of). But since I won't get the chance to see her in person until after Thanksgiving break, I'm just writing to make sure she knows that I actually kinda like her (in my own passive-aggressive way), and that I'm not just going after any female life form that moves. Well, that and because I'm procrastinating this eight page paper I should be writing.

TL;DR-flirted with girl I like on Thursday night; hooked up with other girl on Friday night at a party she was at; hope I didn't fuck things up too bad"""

Somebody once told me that """"try all the ice cream flavors first"""" before choosing your favorite. I don't want to miss out on anything and I don't want to be clingy. There's so many other flavors I have yet to try. So, back again to this girl, I want to ask her out on a real date because she's actually cool, but I am afraid that I will be missing out on other """"flavors.""""

Furthermore, she stopped texting me. We've texted quite a bit, but recently the texts have stopped, replaced by silence.

I'm a guy and I was forced into having oral sex with my 16 year old male cousin when I was about 3 or 4 years old. My memory of it is pretty hazy, but all I remember is that he enticed me with one of my toys and that he never ""finished the job"" because he heard my grandmother coming into the room. It's been nearly 18 years since that incident and for most of my life I've just suppressed that memory. I just don't know how to react to it or if I've even really been affected by it. I'm not sad nor do I feel like I'm an innocent victim. I do know that I am sexually bisexual, but romantically hetero..if that makes sense lol. But I've never even kissed anyone of either gender and when I notice a girl likes me I usually break out into cold sweats and have to leave the room. I don't think I'm unattractive and there have been a few girls in the past who've had some interest in me. But I find it difficult to connect to people emotionally. I feel emotionally hollow and don't think it would be fair to enter a one-sided relationship. I take comfort in being a loner.  On the whole, I have a pretty negative attitude towards sex (which I view as a shameful act) and humanity in general. The problem is, I don't know if this is a result of that early encounter, or because of my abusive upbringing under fundamentalist, but hypocritical ""Christian"" parents, or if it's just me. Is it possible to have been sexually abused as a child in the past and not have had any consequences because of it? After all, as far as I can remember, it was a one-time incident."

Sometimes I play music in my room, close my eyes, and pretend I'm dancing with the love of my life. I don't know him yet but I was raised as a mushy romantic. My dad told me when he asked my mom to dance the first time he saw her, he avoided dating her after that because things would have been too serious. But the day he saw her on a date with another guy he knew that he had to make her his wife, she was the one. Every friday night for as long as I can remember, my dad would cook dinner for us, and they would play music, and we would all dance. My life growing up with my parents has been amazing. And I think it's because of how much they love each other. The way my mom made him laugh and his light heartedness has always been the best feeling to go home to. My parents being multiracial has only made it more amazing because both of them are liberal but have the same morals of what it means to be a good person. My dad said what he loved about my mother the most is that she was his best friend. She had a simpleness to her but a drive and zest for life. Mommy, dad and I miss you very much. As I stand here playing our song, dancing with my pillow, imagining the person I will spend my life with... I think of everything you and dad taught me.

After I ignored him, he and his friends proceeded to scream how ugly I was and other profanities at me....Seriously? Why is there nothing at Cornell to actually EDUCATE guys about sexually harassing girls, both verbally and physically? Why is there no program, at events like orientation and pledging, about teaching boys not to be horny assholes and for girls to stop pretending to want sex when all they actually want is attention?? With all the rapes that have happened - there is still no system by which we can report sexual harassment. If there was a penal system for guys, they would definitely stop harassing girls as readily.

Oh, cry me a river with the argument that guys have it hard in terms of societal pressures on being successful with girls - but that does not justify you sexually harassing us. The shit that comes out of your mouths can be traumatizing. And in turn, ladies - stop making it hard for other girls by thinking it's okay to be a tease. There's a difference between flirting and teasing. All that does is give boys the wrong ideas about girls in general. Also, ladies - word of advice - before you commit to a man, make sure you see him when he's drunk - then you'll know how much of an asshole he actually is with his guard down."""

""Back in mid 2010 I stumbled upon this neat internet currency called Bitcoin, and I thought it was pretty cool, so I bought some, and then more.  Eventually I had poured my savings I made from tutoring and washing dishes during my summers into it.  It wasn't a whole lot, but it was everything I had, and a lot more than I was willing to lose.  Eventually I kinda forgot about it because I was busy with school and girls, but one day my friend asked me if I was still invested, because the price was at $180.  I told him I wasn't.  I was.  Eventually the price had risen above $1100 a piece at which point I was avidly following every rise and dip.  

I was preparing to sell when the price dropped to ~$875 following its peak.  I had spoken to a lawyer about declaring my gains to the IRS and all that jazz.  I was gonna have just shy of 8 figures to my name.  My entire life I'd been told that I'd work hard and bust my ass so that I might be able to experience comfort and success in life.  It didn't matter that I didn't want to go into business or accounting or finance as my dad had demanded.  What I wanted didn't matter in the grand scheme of things, but because I was curious and made a lucky decision a couple years before, I was gonna be free.  I would be able to forego all that bullshit and study what I want to study, maybe go to trade school and become a carpenter like I had always wanted.  I was gonna be free from the financial stress that looms over the average American's head.  I was gonna be free.  

One day I came home to find that my dad, without my permission, had sold my computer to a friend of his.  It was sitting under my bed, unused, so he figured I didn't need it anymore.  And just like that, everything I had invested in was gone.  I didn't eat for weeks.  I haven't spoken more than a few sentences to my dad since.  It's been about a year now.

I'm here and I see all these people studying their asses off to get some high-paying job to be able to feel secure in life, and I can relate because I'm here for the same reason.  But unlike them, I had the golden opportunity to be able to retire at 18 years old, and my dad sold it for a couple hundred bucks to his friend.

For some reason, the ""joke"" got out of hand and somehow made it from my small circle of friends into the wider global community. So now everyone thinks I'm gay. It makes it so awkward to talk to a girl and she starts looking at me weirdly when I try flirting. One girl even just came right out and said it ""Wait, I thought you were gay. Why are you hitting on me?"" People are even encouraging me to go to LBGT meetings and guys are hitting on me left and right. I've got nothing against gay people, but holy fuck, how can one joke get so out of hand??? So now I've effectively come out of the closet when I was never in the fucking closet to begin with and I'm still a virgin!

""Every once in a while, I go to a Christian Bible study group on campus.  I’ve tried a couple different groups, but every time I go to one, I leave wondering why I even went.  My problem is that I completely support homosexuality.  I’m straight, but some of my best friends are gay, and I will stand up for LGBT rights until the day I die.  However, when I participate in these Christian groups, it’s inevitable that someone is going to bring up the sinfulness of homosexuality; it’s happened every single time I’ve gone.  And I can’t handle it.

The really interesting thing about the Bible is that you can use it to justify absolutely anything.  At the Bible study I just went to, we were studying Galatians 1:11-24.  In the excerpt we were looking at, Paul is reflecting on his personal journey from a life of evil (ordering innocent people to be executed was basically his job) to a life following the righteous path.  Anyway, when we started discussing what Paul meant when he said, “the gospel that was preached by me is not man’s gospel”, one of the other group members piped up.  He claimed that this could be interpreted as refusing to support homosexuality, because if you believe that being gay is acceptable, then you’re believing in the false words of man over the true gospel of God.  However, my first reaction after reading the passage was the exact opposite: when Paul is talking about his dark past, he describes himself as “extremely zealous […] for the traditions of my fathers”.  He is ashamed of his blind acceptance of the evil ways of his predecessors, which I thought was perfectly applicable to the way all people can become more accepting of formerly shunned things like homosexuality.

But now we get to the heart of the issue:  if I go to these Christian group meetings, I have to stand up for my beliefs, which are not the same as the beliefs of the average Christian.  But I can’t do that; I can’t go to these meetings and hijack the conversation every time someone bashes homosexuality.  I want to, but it’s just not right.  It’s like a feminist going to a meeting of misogynists and hoping that someone will share their opinions.  Please don’t take this the wrong way.  I know that Christianity is so much more than the one belief that I don’t agree with.  But I just can’t do it anymore.  I can’t go to these meetings because I can’t stand by while these things are being said.  Gays, lesbians, bisexuals, transsexuals, and asexuals are the way they are, and they aren’t doing anything wrong.  They can’t change, and their existence is not hurting you in any way.  And if they’re sinning by being who they are, then I guess I might as well do a little sinning myself by supporting them as much as I can.

I’m sorry, but I can’t go to your Bible studies anymore.  I’ve got more important things to do, like getting out there and showing the world that love is for everyone."

When I was 10-going-on-11, I would check the mail constantly in the hopes that I would get a Hogwarts acceptance letter just like Harry ""Dumbledore's Pet"" Potter. Every single day of the summer between 5th and 6th grade, I would check the mailbox hoping that it would come. It never did. But I kept my hopes up. All throughout middle school I waited and waited, hoping that some mixup happened--my owls died in the trans-Atlantic journey, I was magically stunted developmentally and so matured at a later date, Dumbledore hated me because I was brown, loved hip-hop, and had a big dick, etc. As the weeks became months and the months became years, I eventually had to focus on doing well in school and getting along with my filthy Muggle friends. By the time 12th grade rolled around, I knew it was too late. Even if I somehow managed to make it into Hogwarts, I'd be 7 years younger than the incoming freshman. So I toughened up and applied to college. You filthy Muggles will never know what it's like to settle for Cornell over Hogwarts. The only time I feel happy is when I'm walking up the slope and the fucking watchtower is playing my jam: ""The Harry Potter Theme Song"". #FuckMuggles #FuckMudBloods #FuckBeingAnEngineerIWantToBeAFuckingWizard #FuckDumbledore #FuckHarryPotter"

I've spent a couple of years up here, but I just realized how little personal information I know about a few of my better friends on campus. So I started asking them about their favorite movies, music, games, foods, stories... and I am surprised by how often I receive vague answers, as though they're insecure about it or think I have some hidden agenda. If you're one of those people, please stop that! There's no need to put up a wall like that. I'm not evaluating your tastes or secretly devising a plan to foil your love of cheesecake, I'm just trying to turn current friends into better ones and that's why I'd like to get to know you better! Even if I did judge you negatively for your love of quiche (ugh you disgust me) or thrash metal (I mean, not my thing, but I could live with that), then so what? I wouldn't be worth hanging out with, anyway! :)

And the sad thing is that this is starting to make me feel like I barely even know people here after spending half of my undergraduate years with them. I've started to realize that the people I go out with all the time won't ever be anything more than drinking buddies and hookups, and I more than likely won't keep in contact with them much after we graduate. I'm looking for so much more interaction than that in these last couple years, and I need someone who won't turn to stone whenever I try to get to know them. I guess that I'm just lonely... Screw that! I'll keep looking for someone that has the confidence to actually do a little give and take and tell me about themselves rather than get drunk, high, and hook up once in a while like so many others.

- from a frustrated guy that's been in and out of more organizations and activities than he can count, has met probably thousands of undergraduates here, and still doesn't really know people quite like his high school friends. Get to know me!*

An ode to CHEM 3530

So much writing and it ain't even good.
Words been pourin' out, but they ain't been understood.
My brain is trying its hardest
Just to soak up all it can.
I'll try to clear this up for you
so you can understand.
I'm writing, yes I'm writing, 
which I normally love to do.
But these things that I've been writing
have me feeling kind of blue.
I'm writing with lots of hopes and
I'm writing with lots of fears,
But most of all I'm writing
To do this semester what most do in one year.  (3530s, ya feel me?)
This is Cornell Confessions, you say?
Now hear me out, I'm not quite done.
I've felt quite smart until this day,
and now I feel quite dumb. 
All these kids, they seem to have it together.
Me?  I'm a recluse who reads alone in my room.
And on top of orgo, there's this fucking gloomy weather.
So basically, what I see is impending doom. 
But, alas!  I know this cannot last,
and I know I'm not alone.
This semester's winding down quite fast,
and soon I will be home."

I used to watch porn. I started when I was like 12 years old. But I haven't watched it in about 10 years. One day, when I was 14, my mom walks into the bedroom and sees me doing it. She was astonished and just started throwing things at me and yelling at me to stop. I ignored her and kept going. So she told my dad about it. He put up the child-safety locks on the search engines. But I found ways to bypass that. About a week passed and one day my mom comes into my room and sees me doing it again. This time she just calmly comes to my table and says: ""Room for one more?"" and she just sits down and watches me...After a few seconds of awkward silence, I just turned off the computer, go outside, and go for a long walk.

That under God, all man and woman spend all coming time in a perpetual bliss. If such a thing as Heaven exist, I would not dare venture to cross the pearly gates of Her threshold. This perpetual bliss comes at the heavy cost of losing you! True bliss is this: knowing that I can spend every waking moment in your company.

If only death do us part, then let us cast aside our dalliances and spend the rest of this life in each other's arms--as lovers must. Your kisses are as sweet ambrose and provide me the sustenance needed for the next day. Drunk in love, let us embrace, my beloved. Let us embrace.

""I was initially paralyzed by the words spilling out of your mouth. That certain piercing despair was followed by painful anxiety. It's been so very difficult learning to look past all the signs of attachment. I've been trying to do so gracefully because I am not one to hold grudges. Maybe I was so delusional and so in love with the theory of us being together? Maybe I fell too soon and too fast? Maybe I lacked the courage to ask what was happening earlier on because deep down I knew it wasn't true at all yet I'd have given anything to stop it from ending? Maybe I knew what I was bound to hear, I just negated it (for my own sake) so my own intense self agony could manifest itself in this idea of perfection and harmony. I did this to myself and that is why I was so angry initially.

It's such a relief to know now what's going on. The entire experience has had me realize how I can't control others' desires. I will never be able to force a certain feeling out of you, or out of anyone. I thought I had learned this from my past relationship yet there was still this certain fear of not being noticed at all by anyone. It still grows inside of me every second that I live, begging for any sort of monumental projection of the shadows and lights of this world. I was so sure that I was the only one who was entirely persuaded that I am nothing in this universe, that mine is the only existence. I wanted so badly to learn of the multi polarities of your black melancholy, with the complete knowledge that even I too, am not at all emotionally capable of a relationship. Because I live in my own state of melancholy. Though there is no romance, I can never look at you with disgust or hate. I would never want to seek revenge. I would never question you or belittle you. I see your worth and I look past your flaws and self belittlement completely, whether this entire thing was romantic or not, whether you're hiding yourself away or not. I no longer have any anger towards myself. I had to let it bleed out of my skin. Then I became in touch with reality: I still matter. I have to take care of myself first. Although life for me is torture, I cannot renounce my sincerity towards those who help me see my own worth in any way.

I do not know why I live or why I do not stop living. These are the questions I encounter daily. I see such absurd motives for living and I'd say that I reject the world. I wish I could say that I am unafraid to glide alone in this absolute nothingness that this world provides. That would be a lie. 

I just want to avoid regret as much as possible because that is what paralyzes and cuts short of our aspirations. This was all a graceful dream, absent of the usual tragic and intense sadness that shadow my inner flow. So I do not regret it at all. This was about a captivity, an ecstasy away from this brutal world that mingled and sparked, only in my own mind, a weird dance. This certain mysterious obscurity still exists and I still want it to exist with all of my heart. Hell, I can't even look at you without feeling that dance. It will no longer hurt for me because I can no longer distinguish between hope and despair. I find ways to trigger both, I will never be self enlightened.

None of this will ever make sense. The thought of what has happened will fuck with my mind for a while. But then I think back and realize that none of this is significant at all. """

Here's how bad my OCD is. I've just learned about the dozenal system - that is base 12 - and how much superior it is to the decimal system. What's worse is, I've learned that it is the most efficient and best system to use, because 12 is the smallest number with the most factors. It's divisible by 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12, as opposed to 10, which is only divisible by 1, 2, 5, 10. So in dozenal, 1/3, 1/4, 1/6 are whole numbers. So it turns out there IS a best counting system to use, and the whole world DOES NOT use it. And now every time I see a number I go - ughhhh, it's fine but it could be better. Why can't everything be optimized for efficiency. Why can't we use base 12. Serious OCD."

I was really hopeful because I thought maybe that last post about someone being shy, was you...I'm still not sure really.

I met you this semester
I got to know you just over a week ago and so much has happened in this one week
You're so cute
you caught my eye and I don't think I've stopped staring
I never ever thought things would escalate so quickly
It was the heat of the moment, so hot, and so romantic.
I've loved every moment that I've spent with you so far
You're so silly, so honest, so quirky..haha and so smug.

But I don't know what you want and I don't want to push you into anything.
You're still new to relationships and probably want to explore your options...and don't know what you really want (not that I really do..but i have a better idea from experience?)
I've been pretty lost myself and then you came along.
I havent felt that tickle in the pit of my stomach in so long and I don't want to let it go.

Its selfish I know

Real Confession - My friend is single and I have a boyfriend that I love. I am extremely jealous of my friend because of how hot she is. I purposely recommend ugly outfits so she would not look as pretty but for some reason she always looks good. I know it should not matter because she is single and I have an incredible boyfriend but it bothers me. We went out and guys were all over her and she turned all of them down nicely and easily like it was normal. She doesn't even know how she pretty she is which makes it worse. I know it makes me a horrible friend to feel this way but I can't help it. She has such an outgoing and infectious personality, which makes her even more desirable. Help... I don't want to feel this way about one of my best friends."

I check your FB profile a dozen times a day and stop myself from sending you a message, not sure if it would be appropriate because I have no clue how you feel.

""My boyfriend never let's me get a word in edgewise. We are always talking about him or discussing his problem or hearing about what goes on at his school or his plans for the future. I have things going on too and I can never tell him. He used to be my best friend and we used to talk ALL the time. I understand that things come up so the quantity of the conversations may be cut short, but the quality has been too. 

He also has a habit of not letting me express an opinion. By that I mean that if something bothers me, and he doesn't think it's logical -- he tells me that I shouldn't feel that way; that I'm wrong. He never apologizes for anything he does. It doesn't matter if it hurts me or not, because if it isn't what he intended he shouldn't have to apologize for something he didn't mean.

I just let go of someone who was suppose to be my best friend here, because she managed to make everything immensely complicated and I didn't need that in my life. She constantly put me second, lied, and genuinely thought that the word sorry fixed everything magically -- instead of actually trying to not do the offending actions. So now, I'm completely alone. All I have is him, and he isn't really there. He would argue that he is, but if that's true why the hell do I feel so shitty inside? I need someone too, you know? """

""This confession isn't very anonymous. Anyone reading this post who knows me will also know that I wrote it.

This semester, I wrote a novel. I wrote it for a lot of different reasons, but, in a lot of ways, I wrote it to cope with my own depression. For the past few years at this school, I've been pretty unhappy and lonely. It actually took me by surprise; I wasn't this way in high school, but there you go. Things change, people change, and nothing stays in place.

But I've always liked stories. So I channeled that, or maybe I just distracted myself. I created a little world, full of places I wished I could go to, people I wished I could meet, and characters who felt as unhappy as I did, but for better and more interesting reasons. I built a fictional place that I could kind of understand; it didn't have clear answers, but at least it had a few clear questions.

Writing kept me busy. It kept me engaged. It gave me something to do between classes and on late weekend nights in my dorm room, between the problem sets and exams.

But the book's done now, for the most part. Things have gone back to the way they were before. I feel lonely and sad again. And it doesn't seem like anyone will ever read my book. I'm going to try, but getting published is like one in a million. I can't even get my friends here at Cornell to read it; nobody has the time.

I guess I get that. But if I can't even convince people who know me to look it over, then what chance do I have with a literary agent or a publisher?

I'm pretty depressed at this point. I don't know what I'll do now. I guess I've got fewer things to distract me from classes. But I've also got fewer things to distract me from my thoughts. 

I guess I'll just work on finishing this semester well. And the one after that, and then the one after that. I have goals. I have plans. But I still feel really alone.

I need to think of other things. Thanks for reading.

[Take a creative writing class next semester, or try to find a professor that specializes in the genre your novel is in. Good luck!]"

Having been raised in a racist household, I've found it very difficult to fight my prejudices. Although I would never openly say or do anything to hurt my friends of different ethnicities and colors, I know...I feel that there's a monster lurking in my subconscious. It's hard to explain this in words..I love all of my friends and really don't wish any of them or any person of any other race any harm. But at the same time I find myself thinking certain thoughts, feeling certain emotions when I'm put in a sticky situation. I guess the best example of one case would be when I see interracial couples: i.e. a white guy with a girl of ""my race"". I have no clue why, but it bothers me when I see these pairings, even though there are two or three in my own extended family. As stupid and immature as it sounds, I feel like that guy ""stole"" a precious sister of my race. I ask myself ""Why is SHE with HIM?"" and I go out of my way trying to analyze the situation and I come up with some bogus reasoning that she's trying to ""marry up"" the social ladder, even though in all realness love can happen between the unlikeliest of people in the unlikeliest of situations. I end up feeling like someone punched me in the gut and I feel weak and uneasy for sometime afterwards. I know I feel this way because my parents would often say things like that against interracial couples when I was a child growing up...so it's been kind of ingrained in me. But I just want to stop doing this. I want to stop being a closet racist. As hard as I try, fighting these feelings is such an uphill battle. Does anyone here have any suggestions? Do I need therapy to ""deprogram"" my brain? I can't keep feeling this way. I'm going to end up being a hateful, spiteful little man. I don't want to go down that road and I don't want to hate, or even have any form of antagonistic feelings against people I've never met before. Is there any way to get over my ""hate"" of other races (especially white people)? Is there any way for me to get over my own ""racial pride"", thinking that all colored people of my race have to stick together? In spite of my hypocrisy, please don't hate or judge me for confessing something like this."

I have 1 real friend here and i still dont really trust him. and there is one person here who understands me at all and i fucked that up before i even got here to the point where we arent even speaking. i just dont have the energy to keep up the facade of being ""okay"" or ""mentally balanced"" or ""a functioning member of society"" anymore. i feel like its my sublime destiny to hold the world in the palm of my hand. but everyday, its slipping farther and farther away and if i cant be that person, whats the fucking point. my mental state is akin to narcissus, after years of self admiration, having a flaw pointed out by a stranger and then being unable to see anything else.

I keep my distance, I even occasionally just turn and take a different route, because it annoys me to be perceived this way.

""It was around 12:40am of Nov 1 when I bumped into a former student of mine together with her Asian female friend somewhere in west campus. It seemed like her friend had something to drink but I could not ascertain since I do not go to parties and am not familiar with behaviors influenced by alcohol.

My student and I caught up briefly (she's very sweet!) but her companion was getting a bit impatient and started wandering off. Her companion was calling my student every now and then, motioning her that they already had to go. I kept on insisting my student that we have to cut the conversation because her friend's already calling her. But my student, being her sweet self, said that she sees her friend everyday but rarely sees me and carried on chatting with me. It got to the point when her companion got so irate that she approached us and started yelling at me that she has been """"fucking"""" calling my student again and again that they had to leave already.

At that moment, I just froze. I did not know how to react and just said sorry a couple of times. I found it shocking that her Asian friend had to shout at me that they had to leave. Even more appalling is her use of foul language. Thoughts then started racing through my head...could it merely be the influence of alcohol (although it did not seem that she was half drunk even)? Why could she not have politely ushered my student out instead of shouting at me?

The second thought made me think how such a privileged person acted in a despicable manner. It made me think whether living in America is an excuse to eschew Asian values of respect.

But even more so, what haunted me that night was the thought that: If I were white, would she have acted rudely towards me? It still scares me to this point."

""Sunday morning rain is falling
Steal some covers share some skin
Clouds are shrouding us in moments unforgettable
You twist to fit the mold that I am in
But things just get so crazy living life gets hard to do
And I would gladly hit the road get up and go if I knew
That someday it would lead me back to you
That someday it would lead me back to you

That may be all I need
In darkness she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
And I never want to leave. . . 

Do you remember when you sang this to me as we were both lying on my bed?  You were lying on top of me, looking into my eyes and you said between kisses that this song described everything you were feeling.  I was your light in the darkness. I asked you if we could make this our song and you said yes with a smile. . . This past Wednesday my lab TA played it during lab and I was torn to pieces.  The pain rushed in through my veins as this scene, deeply stored in my memory, replayed. 

If you texted me, unblocked me from Facebook, called me, e-mailed me, came looking for me, I'd answer you.  See I've come to realize that, as much as I hate it, our love is like Olivia Pope and Fitzgerald Grant's.  I will be here loving you every time you come back to me.  We'd both attempted to restrain ourselves from one another in the past but all our efforts were futile.  Maybe I should be ashamed, worried, or embarrassed if you read this confession because to you and only YOU will it be really obvious that I wrote it, but screw it. You know I speak my mind.  

I think of you almost every waking moment of my life and you need to know.  You need to know how much I still love you and how every single little spot on this campus has your presence etched in it.  You need to know how incomplete I feel without you.  I feel like my best friend is gone.  The only other person on the planet who could understand me better than I do myself, is gone and I don't know what to do.  You have no idea how my life has been literally falling apart since you left.  It was almost  like a domino effect.  You left, and all stability and luck left with you.  My friends are falling apart, my dreams, and everything I've worked for these past 4 years has been falling apart too and I'm carrying all of this on my own.  I'm strong yes, but even strength needs support.  I feel so alone when at the end of the day, I lay in my bed all by myself.     I don't look forward to coming back to my room because I know I'll come back to emptiness.  A year ago, I came back to your arms, your smile, your support, your love, and no matter how terrible my day had been, YOU were always a source of strength that motivated me. I'm so broken and I'm pretty sure you're not whole either.  Dammit, I wish your love for me was greater than your fears.  I love you so much still.  """

I have herpes. I freaked when I first found out, because all I had ever been taught about sti's is that they are terrible and horrible and that I should do everything in my power to avoid them. I was never taught in health class that an sti isn't the end of the world- that herpes is a harmless, mildly irritating skin condition that is incredibly common. It isn't a punishment for having sex, it doesn't make me dirty, or unloveable. Having herpes is a mild inconvenience for a few days out of every year. What's worse is that my friends, who are otherwise intelligent, educated, and sensitive people, don't seem to know that, or understand that herpes isn't a punchline. We don't think people with other illnesses are at fault, or somehow morally corrupt for having an infection, and yet somehow we are all so scared of sti's and the people with them. Most people will probably get one at some time in their lives, so maybe practice a little more compassion?"

We were not doing anything, just standing there with our ID's. He screamed: ""NO ONE IS GETTING IN!"" and pushed both us of. I almost fell over. We tried calling the police to report him, but the police didn't believe us. We tried talking to the manager at Pixel that night, and he said that there is no way his employee would do such a thing.

""I don't really know why I'm doing this- any of this. It sort of feels like the only reason is because I don't have another choice. I get out of bed because I have to when some days all I actually want to do is hibernate until it's winter break and I can go home where people actually care. Well, I suppose some people care here, when they notice. People who have known me longer are better at seeing through when I'm just going through the motions or are more inclined to call me on it and check in.
It's exhausting, a never-ending dance of problem sets, lab reports, work, grading, projects, and more that would readily identify me to anyone reading this. I'm exhausted. Such a funny word in how appropriate it seems to be. I have no energy, not motivation, no WHY I'm doing this. I'm not sure if I've had a why in a while. Which logically I realize is the crux of the matter, but it's really hard to look for light in a dark room when the how is all but physically crushing you into the floor. But, again, no other option really. I'm not suicidal, not even close. I'm tired, but I've no desire to be dead. And repulsed at the thought of what it would do to my family and close friends. Though admittedly I'll have morbid thoughts about if anyone here would mourn me if I died in an accident or something like that. I know they'd notice, but I'm not so sure very many people here would actually miss me.
So I keep going. And going. And for what? A Friday night where I can have a few hours of not-so-free freedom because my brain is nagging me over that e-mail needing to be written and then crying for hours because it just doesn't feel like everything I'm putting in is equating to anything. My life isn't exactly functioning at the Carnot efficiency right now. I've gotten maybe 25 hours of sleep since Sunday, a lot of junk food from some stressed out cravings for carbs, and even more work for this weekend out of the deal.
And I get that my life is nowhere near as hard as a LOT of people's. But to deny that I'm in pain because others are in worse is to deny anyone the right to feel pain or joy because someone else always has it worse or better.
I'm also realizing how incoherent this all really is but give no shits. I'm not even sure that there's a point to me writing this, except maybe I haven't given up hope entirely and am praying there's some small sense of catharsis. Something besides the stupor I'm hiding in because right now reality pretty much sucks.
Geez, I really can't give up hope entirely, because there's no way I can allow this to end on a completely hopeless note (though hope seems to be making the situation a hell of a lot worse). But I can't say I know what lesson, if there is one, can be learned here, whether it's one for you or me. Or maybe I just don't want to admit it. One of my greatest weaknesses is fear of being vulnerable or out of control- it's really what isolates me from other people. It's why I'm throwing this away into the depths of the Internet where Cornell Confessions isn't going to post it rather than confiding in a friend. I guess what I need to learn, and probably a lot of other people at Cornell, is that in order for people to be in your lives, you do have to let them in.You have to admit when it's going to be hard rather than forging on pretending that it will be easy. You have to ask for help. You have to admit to yourself that you are scared because, really, only then can you be brave enough to take it on and take it down. Here's hoping I and everyone, everywhere, is able to do just that.

""I have a question to all you feminists out there:

I recently watched a video of a woman walking through the streets of NYC being cat-called by multiple men from a variety of neighborhoods. The video can be seen here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1XGPvbWn0A
Although many of the people in this video said things of a veiled sexual nature, there were also more than a few who simply acknowledged her beauty and just wanted to greet her or ask her out. My question is this: what is the line between a compliment and harassment? Is it really a sin to approach a woman on the street and ask her out, even if your initial encounter with her lasts but a couple of seconds, if that even? I understand that pursuing a relationship should ideally be based on more than superficial attraction. But if the sight of a person does make your heart skip a beat, isn't it well worth the cost to ask her out just to see where it goes? Lastly, why is it a widely accepted paradigm in society that if a """"regular-looking, working-class guy"""" exhibits such behavior in public it's considered harassment, but if a rich, powerful, modern-day casanova like George Clooney does it, it's considered a form of flattery for the woman? 

-Sincerely,
    An Honest Inquirer

-This was a real question btw. I wasn't being a sarcastic assclown. I think that many men are probably of a similar mindset. Sometimes we do things that are considered offensive out of ignorance, not out of malcontent or a conscious sense of superiority to women. Yet when there is an outpouring of criticism from feminist circles without proper reasoning, many men are kept either angry, confused, or highly cynical of the feminist movement in general.

If you saw me walk past you, you wouldn't bat an eye. I'm your stereotypical frat guy: white, buff, vineyard vines, pastels, all of that. But I have a bit of a secret. I think with almost no question that I am sexually attracted to men. I don't know why. Whenever I meet a guy that I have a spark with, I get butterflies in my stomach and just want him to be mine. Whenever I meet a guy with gorgeous eyes or an incredible body, I'm just speechless and want him so badly. But from the position I'm in, the most we could ever be are best friends and to be honest, thats what I wished was all I wanted from him. But I want something more. I have a bit of a problem. I've known for quite a while that homosexuality was a part of my identity but I have always imagined myself with a woman. I've always wanted that picture perfect family. I don't know what it is but I just love how a heterosexual couple looks. There seems to be a such a balance, an elegant dance between aggression and docility. It just looks right to me. I want that so badly. It's not like I'm completely unattracted to women, I've had sex with many girls before and enjoyed my experience for the most part. But there just isn't that spark I feel with a guy. I don't have butterflies in my stomach even when I talk to a gorgeous girl. When I meet a girl I have a great connection with I just want to friend zone the fuck out of her. I want to be her best friend but nothing more. Yet I don't want to be in a gay relationship in the long run. I don't want to be homosexual relationship and have to live a life of continuous discrimination. When I see a homosexual couple, I just see two guys holding hands, not a couple. Of course I'm sure there is an incredible love and bond between them, but I just don't see myself in their position. I want to be straight and live a straight life so much, yet I can't help but be attracted to men. I'm just so attracted to masculinity and strength. Ive spoken with a very select number of people about this and they've told me that I needed to really figure out if I am attracted to men by hooking up with a guy so I've downloaded Grinder. But I just can't bring myself to show my identity because of how much shit I'll probably get from my brothers and because I don't want to be gay. I want to live the life of a ""normal"" (gay people are of course normal but you know what I mean) straight guy. I don't know what to do. I have this fantasy that this is just a phase and just a ""college thing"" but i know the chances of that being true are next to none. At the same time, I don't want to live in denial my entire life and live my life with a woman I'm not attracted to. I wouldn't want to do that to her nor myself. But I just can't get myself to accept homosexuality. I just can't. I don't want a gay relationship. I wish I could just have a consistent fwb where we can both take care of our needs yet live ""straight"" lifestyles in every other aspects. What do I do? Where do I go from here?"

""I cannot understand how cat-calling is harassment. If a gay man were do the same to me, I'd be really flattered that he found me attractive. 

It's not something I'd ever do, but do you really think men are maliciously trying to harass you and establish the patriarchy by throwing a wolf-whistle your way? More likely they just want to make it known that they like you physically.

 It's great that you've spread the word about cat-calling to the Cornell community, where I've never once seen it happen.

I know you do.  I just don’t get why you stay with her.  I’d do just the same things with you (you know what I mean), except I’m classier, and smarter, and I get your stupid humor, and I know when you’re joking even though it seems like I don’t…  I’m sarcastic and like to bust chops, I know the difference between “your” and “you’re,” and I fucking love it when you say “yeaaaahhhh” like you said you said it in high school with your stupid dumb friends.  But you weren’t stupid cause you were like number four in your class.  AND SO WAS I.  That alone, the fact that we were the same rank in our respective classes, should show you that you and me, we belong, we belong, we belong togetthhhhherrrrrr.  WEEEEEE BELONG.  Basically, I’ve gotten to know you fairly well over the past couple years, at school and work, and you’re one person I’d like to keep getting to know for however long you’d want to keep getting to know me.  I don’t move fast, but that makes things goooood.  Good as honey that actually crystallizes.  Damn, that’s a good analogy.  See???????  I’m SMART.  I’M AT GODDAMN CORNELL AND I’M FUNNY.

I don’t know if I love you, per say, but things like that, words spoken like that, take time to grow into.  You know it as well as I.  I just wish you’d take the time with me.  Take the time with me.  Spend the time with me.  We live two minutes apart.  And when we’re at school, when you visit upstate, you visit me!  Visit me!  I’ll show you Cornell and bring you cool places!  And I can ride the bus from Ithaca to New York, and from New York to your school!!  And you’ll show me your school and all of its hoodish glory… But seriously, I’d love to see it with you.  I’d love to walk down the street holding your hand.  I’d love to actually hug you, rather than think about doing it on the last day of at our place of employment if our employers weren’t there.  Or at least shake your hand.  Seriously.  Annnd.  You’re tall.  And I’m tall.  And our hands would be at the perfect height for each other for holding.  

Also, the only reason I know you would see this is if you were stalking Cornell Confessions to see if I’ve posted anything.  And if you were doing that, that’s just to say you’re in love with me and should date me instead of that skank whore.  

I’m just kidding around.  I’m sure she’s a cool person and has a great personality.

I hate Halloween. As a woman, it used to be a day when girls could dress up as their favorite fictional character. Now, females are expected to dress as some type of debased sex slave fantasy character. Whatever, I get it, I am super lame for expressing these thoughts. Every sorority whore will be dressed in her bra and underwear & I am just jealous cause I don't have a body like that. Wrong, as a former model (which is a justification I don't think I need to even provide, but because it will silence those sororstitutes & frat-hoes and frat-bros who are assuming I am ugly ass), I hate to see that since a young age Halloween encourages females to dress as Princesses & in their adulthood to dress as hobags. It seems like a trivial thing - it's one day, it's just for fun, but it's a national phenomenon. It's subtle things like this that loose the fight against women's equality all the time. #HeisforShe"

I am addicted to pornography and masturbation; I have realized I have an unhealthy obsession with women. (dont worry i haven't stalk anyone, but many do). I finally got to a 12 step addiction help program and became sober. I came to Cornell and wanted to make new friends, just friends, girls and guys no differently. I tried hard but I didn't succeed. I did make some friends with girls it seemed at first, but nothing more than friends, and I was happy with that. However to them i wasn't a friend, just an acquaintance, we said hi after class, but never got together, even after sending them multiple texts. 
This became my new addiction, wanting them to answer my text; I would wait night after night and end up with no work done. I broke a week ago, started looking at porn again, and tonight I masturbated for the first time in 10.5 months. It’s heartbreaking. I just want friends."

This has happened to me 3 times now - after the date, right as we're waiting to cross the street or for some other reason standing next to each other she'll sort of bring her head back a little and look at me for a few seconds, usually her eyes would get bigger. I mean not really lean in, but it feels like she's stepping on her toes and bringing herself closer, but trying not to do it too visibly. I don't know if that means she expects me to kiss her. It could be just my imagination and she's simply looking at me as we're talking. But I did notice it all 3 times and it only lasted a few seconds. I think a kiss is more of a second date thing, so I don't want to make a mistake, but does that sound like something girls do? I am really new to dating, so any advice is appreciated."

I see the pictures of all of you going to parties and mixers, going on dates, hanging out, having fun. Meanwhile, I'm alone with my work and miserable - professors don't realize how much their assignments pile up on students, or maybe they just don't care. Lately, I feel like I've been rowing up shit creek without a paddle, and any mileage I've made would have been made so much easier with a friend now and then.

""People often say I'm """"alternative"""" """"artsy"""" or a  hipster, and I'm not necessarily doing anything to dispel those beliefs. Usually I'm into the """"alternative"""" guy, the punks, the artists, the musicians, you know the type, scruffy with nice shoes and maybe smoking a cigarette?
Anyway, for some reason, I've been really interested in the more athletic, clean cut dudes lately. It's not at parties that I find them attractive in their pastel button downs, it's the guys walking across the quad in cozy looking patagonia pullovers and canvas sneakers, that I would love to go home with and we'd study for a bit and maybe hook up and he'd text me to come over and watch a movie or get pizza. I don't want a guy who's completely invested in me, but someone who cares and it doesn't have to be complicated.

""

An overwhelming majority of U.S. citizens support a minimum wage that should be raised to living standards. Union activity has also aroused a great deal of public support. National health care is advocated strongly by the public as well. Unfortunately, neither party has acceded to demands of the public. All three of these policies have been repeatedly struck down by the federal government. Why, you ask? Because our politicians have prostituted themselves to the corporate elite. There is no Illuminati, no secret Skull & Bones Satanists, no Freemason scheme, and no Jewish conspiracy to make Israel a world empire. But there are those who have risen to power under our so-called free-market capitalist democracy who seek to maintain their power through their financial dynasties. If you ask me, the West no longer functions as a democracy. It is the Roman Republic/Empire all over again--a plutocracy in which the few heap rewards upon themselves at the expense of the many. The vast majority of our citizens do not have a voice anymore. Short of seeking immortality, most (but probably not all) of these wealth hoarders will employ any and every tactic to centralize their power and maintain it for their following generations of descendants. The rich are not fucking job creators, at least not many of them. By growing complacent and willingly placing ourselves under heavily financed propaganda machines (ahem, Fox--or should I say Fuck--News) we are relinquishing our freedom and unknowingly subjugating ourselves to corporate tyrrany. If you hope to one day join their ranks, know this: they are knowingly making social mobility an outdated concept--it will be harder and harder to climb the ranks into the .01 percent.

A lot of times I just feel so alone. I'm a new graduate student at Cornell in a very rigorous field. I'm a bit older too (late 20's) because I took time off after undergrad to work and travel. Many of my """"friends"""" in my department and people I just meet at parties or bars, who happen to be grad students, have these age insecurities too and talk about how """"old"""" they are. They're 22 or 23. I just want to be like: """"shut the fuck up, you're not old!""""    

I guess my own insecurity with my age and where I am in life also stems with my life experiences. I've lost my brother and father in the past six years. Three years ago my younger and only sibling accidentally overdosed on a speedball. He was a brilliant, budding scientist but also liked to experiment with hard drugs. Go back six years ago, my dad died from cancer. Now its just me and my mom. I'm like, what the fuck. Who can relate to the loss and pain I've gone through, here at Cornell? 

I'm  a social guy and outgoing, and I've made some good friends here thus far, but I'm not satisfied, I haven't found my group yet. 

And then don't get me started about dating. As a grad student, I feel like its not as easy to meet people as it was in undergrad. So much work all the time. I'm in a research field and am taking three hard classes and have a Research Assistantship that I have to do well in. 

I'm hoping that any day now, things are going to magically fall into place. But I know that to be a falsehood.

I'm starting to wish I went to an easier school and did a more technical major. I'm a senior in one of the business based majors here and find that while I've been very successful academically, I might not have the personality for some of the jobs I'm interviewing for. I feel like they want you to be like a super personable, corporate robot who has the answer to ""walk me through your resume"" memorized perfectly, specific answers to all of the ""tell me about a time when..."" questions, and certain personal qualities that I'm starting to wonder if I'm lacking. It feels like being yourself or deviating from a very specific mold when interviewing with them makes them disinterested in you. I definitely have skills, high grades, good previous work experience, and am interpersonally competent, pleasant, and at least average looking. I also know that I've made marked improvements in my interviewing skills even in the past few months. I'm more than willing to work on my own weaknesses to improve myself and have made a point of doing this. I just feel like maybe if I had majored in something different (and more technical) there would be more of an emphasis on what I can do rather than just how nicely I'm able to present myself."

When thinking about it, it makes me wonder why she wasn't attracted to me in this sense.

""I hate my father and his side of the family. I've been sexually abused by them, been witness to my mother being mocked for her dark skin and educated upbringing, seen my dad nearly pull the hair out of her scalp, and watch as he verbally and physically assaulted her and my younger brothers for about 2 decades. Just two years ago we also found out about his numerous affairs and potential children he had with other women--one of whom he financed and helped move into the neighborhood, literally 2 blocks away from us. On top of dealing with my own depression and flaws, knowing all of this really screwed me up mentally. I wasn't a top-achiever in my engineering class by any means, but I did survive. I've seen by GPA plummet from ~3.3-3.4 in the middle of sophomore year to a truly horrible level. I feel like I've wasted my time here and my mother's money--money she accumulated over nearly 15 years as an immigrant in the healthcare industry. Unfortunately, in addition to my student expenses, we also lost money in a scam by my dad's brothers in which we lost a hefty 6-figure sum that now lines their coffers. This money formed a major chunk of our savings and now there's barely any left for my more talented and smarter brothers to go to school. On top of all this, we're pretty sure my dad's been squandering money on his various mistresses and their kids over the years. Unfortunately for us, the man is also a sociopath. He goes to church every Sunday with his little tribe of brothers and their families and puts on a great show--enough to convince our sexist, patriarchal ethno-religious minority community that he's a good man. His hypocrisy would make Jimmy Swaggart swoon. 
Just recently I found out that he punched her in the face. I feel so helpless. We're tied down to him at the moment due to financial, legal, and social constraints (constraints placed upon us by our very religious and conservative community). He is the definition of a deadbeat. He's used my mother's name to get loans to finance shitty businesses he never paid attention to. As a result, in addition to losing our savings, my mother's name is tied up in 6-figure debt. To add insult to injury, she--the sole breadwinner of the household--lost her job 1.5 years ago and we've just been through hell. Surviving off of her money, my dad's nearly put up a fight every week to force her back into a very difficult industry. In addition to all of this, he continues to date and fuck the neighborhood whore and barely tries to cover it up. 
I have a plan in place to help us get off the ground financially and I've finally begun trying to repair my life. But I don't know if I'll succeed--even if I do, it will be 2 or 3 years before I can fully help and relocate my family. Some nights I go to sleep numbed by all the pain and wondering if there's a God in heaven who hears my desperate plea for help. I know I don't have the right to complain and many others have faced worse situations--drug-addict parents, orphans, war refugees, etc.--the list is endless. Some of these poor souls probably even go to school here. I gather strength from knowing that there are people who came before me who did make it through even worse situations (and that I won't be the last). But man, I'm so scared and so alone. I don't want to fail again and yet failure seems to follow me wherever I go. I need to restore my own dignity, but feel trapped by a cycle of dark thoughts. I see my more successful peers around me and it kills me inside. I can't fail...I just can't...I don't know what I'll do if this story turns out for the worse. It will likely have a cruel and macabre ending in a futile attempt to claim justice in an unjust, unforgiving world. """

""My fall break made me realize exactly how much I hate Cornell.

People back home were friendly! Incredible, no? They were happy to see me and they said hello and did other nice things like using the manners they were taught. Simply amazing.

There's none of that here. The vast majority of people I've met here were self-centered and completely fucking rude and inconsiderate (the only exception being, not surprisingly, the working-class people I've met). This attitude is so pervasive that I've been better off spending nearly all my time alone, by choice. I've learned nothing here besides how shitty the people here are, and all I will have to show for my ivy league experience is a piece of paper with my name and """"Cornell University"""" on it.

We still dated until one day, after leaving the hill, she gave up. I wish I could have been my best from the beginning, so the past would not haunt and bring doubts. I truly saw more than a college girlfriend or a """"nice"""" memory in her. Perhaps, the story would be different now. """

Does anyone else thinks it's odd when you go to the library and you have a stranger's face 3 feet away from yours for what could be 4-5 hours and it's someone you've never meet and will likely never meet. It just seems oddly intimate a thing for the amount of actual human contact you have which is zero. Like sometimes I take a break from studying and I find myself thinking - ""Hm I wonder what this person is like"" or ""This person seems so cool I wish we could be friends"" or ""This person is out of this world hot"" but alas, this is weirdly the least appropriate place to try and find any of those things out, despite the fact that, again, we are sitting face to face for 5 hours. Sometimes when they leave it almost feels like the end of a mini-relationship haha. Especially if in that 5 hours I've completed a big assignment or finished a paper - it's like you were the person who was there as I went thru that hardship and emerged on the other side :D I am usually too busy doing homework, but every now and again I look up and I am reminded of the social oddity that is sitting across from someone in the library. It's almost like the astronauts who have to remain focused on whatever they're repairing in space, but every once in a while they get a free 5 seconds and they go - oh right, the Earth is right there."

I really hate my ""friends"" but at the same time I can't help but care about them because I still consider myself to be their closest friend even if they don't treat me that way anymore. Did I do something wrong? I don't think I did, so why don't they actually talk to me? They just used me and when they were done they tossed me aside. Now they just keep me around whenever it's convenient for them but I would still do so much, give so much to make sure they're happy. Haha, I guess it's my fault in the end.

When I went home the past summer, none of my friends from high school (I had just finished freshman year) reached out to me to hang out or spend time together. The friends I make and introduce to each other end up becoming better friends to each other than to me. Its like they've forgotten about me. I know they haven't and I don't want to be a whiny bitch about it but I seriously feel like if I killed myself, people would care and remember for a few years but then forget about me.

""I go out every weekend. Don't get me wrong. I love to be with friends and meeting people is always nice, although a little exhausting.  But back in high school, I use to spend my Saturday nights staying home, watching a shit ton of tv, getting whatever work I needed to do done, and occasionally hang out with just one friend at a time. I was friendly in high school and knew everyone on a friendly basis, but I was happy with just a few very close friends that I sit with in class and hang out with very rarely. 

 Now, I have to make sure I finish enough homework in a short amount of time, and then party and drink with a few """"friends"""" that I can honestly say I still don't know a lot about, despite going out with them. Honestly, I wish I could just live with a couple of close friends and chill with them every Saturday night, instead of going out and catching up with people whom I feel like I can't really get to know. I party, I meet new people, and then I have this overwhelming feeling that I don't actually know anyone, or have friends who can be there for me if I need them or trust me to be there for them.

I use to feel so happy when I hung out with people, because they were really close to me and I felt like I always learned something new about them after being with them. Now, every time I come back from a party/other social gathering, I still question if these people actually even like me, even though we just spent several hours with each other. Plus, I'm just so tired of small talk. 

Everyone I meet is great, but I'm so tired of this pressure to go out and socialize. Why can't I just stay in on my Saturday nights but still maintain close relationships with people? Or why can't I feel close and intimate with the people I drink/party with?"

Also, on a total unrelated note, i met someone during the summer (who happened to go here yet transferred), he was amazing!

As time passed, for some reason, he became very distant and did not respond to the last 2 messages that i sent. i really wish i could know what happened and why the sudden change? I always feels the urge to send another message but i always tell myself that the phone works both, and if he wanted to know about me, he would try to do so. He is on my mind a lot but time has definitely assisted to diminish the sadness that i felt at the beginning of school year..

""I've always thought that I was emotionally healthy but now I increasingly feel that there is something fundamentally wrong with the way I view the world and my interactions with others. I think that I'm independent, that I don't need strong emotional bonds with others, that they don't know who I really am and I don't want them to know that either. In some ways, I am an intensely private person. I only let my friends and family see a part of me, the part of me that I am proud of, the part of me that is normal and unconcerning. No one knows what I really feel, or what I really think. I feel like inherently I'm not a good person, that I have a lack of values, and I am afraid of showing that to my friends because they would hate me for being who I am. I don't want to lose the friends I have, because even though I don't share everything about myself with them, I love spending time with them and really value their friendship. As time passes, I feel myself retreating more and more into myself and getting colder and more uncaring as a person. When anyone pushes me emotionally, when anyone gets upset at me, I harden my heart and put up my walls. I tell myself that that's just a method of self-protection and self-preservation, but sometimes I feel guilty for not being a better person. It is stressful and tiring, trying to reach out and share more of myself, trying to care more about others, trying to be considerate, and in the end I get exhausted with this, and think to myself how much easier it would be if I had no ties, no obligations in this world. If I could do what I wanted and never feel guilty. If I never had to answer to anyone but myself. If I could completely close my heart to the world around me. If I didn't have to worry about people who cared about me. And it takes so much effort to not do just that. Everytime I hurt someone I hate myself a little for not being caring or considerate enough, that something that could come so naturally to others I struggle with. Increasingly I wish people wouldn't care about me so I wouldn't get a chance to hurt them. 

It has been ingrained in me for a very long time to select certain parts of myself to cater to certain people and their expectations of me. I have been told by several people that there are different facades of me that they've never known about, and that I've 'changed' and 'become a different person' from the person they've known, but in actual fact, all these facades make up the real 'me' and that fundamentally I'm still the same person. Just because hanging out with a certain group brings up a part of me more strongly doesn't mean I'm being fake or deceptive. It has also been ingrained in me not to rely on others for emotional support and to look out for myself, that I have the power to make myself happy, and that I deserve happiness. 

I don't know how to change this, and I don't know if I even want to change. I wish I could go back to the time where I was happy with who I was and did not doubt my value as a fellow human being."""

""Dear men,

Honestly, I'd probably feel better if you just said straight up we weren't going to see each other again so I could just move on to the next person.
This whole waiting thing sucks balls. I don't want to text more than once because I don't want to look crazy, clingy, or naggy, but waiting is maddening. I don't know if you're busy, if you've forgotten, or if you're just not interested. Save everyone some time and just say it, please.

Sincerely,

My favorite thing about being completely average looking (maybe even below average), is that I have no doubts about why people like me. (While this narcissistic post may imply otherwise,) I am liked for nothing more than my personality. I love knowing that when a guy has hopelessly fallen for me, or I send a girl into an uncontrollable fit of laughter, it's because of who I am as a person, and not some arbitrary physical characteristics I was assigned at birth. While my confidence in my appearance may be low, my confidence in myself has never been higher: and in an ideal world, (at least in an academically driven world), the latter is what matters. I've never been happier."

""The other day, I thought I almost saw you. Excitement ran through my whole body, until it was crushed as I saw the face. She was your height, and had similar hair, and from a distance, I could swear she looked just like you. But the closer I got, the more the differences jumped out at me. A rage surged through me as I realized it wasn't you. And I just realized that this wasn't a rare occurrence. Every time I see an image of you, an intense anger flows from my chest, to my fist as they automatically clench, as if they had a mind of their own. Let me clarify, I am not angry at you. Your beauty in person creates an sensation best described as a freeing bliss. I am never afraid to be me around you, and I love that about our relationship. When I speak to others, its always so calculating, always from the brain. But with you, its from the soul. And your beautiful personality, so unique, so amazing, so strong, so caring. You have never given me a reason to be angry at you. This anger I am feeling is directed at myself. I am still dealing with how I feel for you. I am happy that at least I am stable. But I am far from good. I am constantly trying to find distractions, because when ever I find any free time, you seem to dance your way into my mind. So seamlessly and fluid, as if it was meant to be. But I am in a never ending battle between my emotions, feelings at a level of intensity that I haven't felt since I had my first kiss to the one who taught me that love was a reality, and not just some odd concept, and my head, always so logical. I want nothing but you, but there is a part of me feeling like it's a waste of time. It ask me whether you are really worth the excitement and feeling of having someone else in my life? I questions are you, who is so great, really worth it all? It questions whether you are even as good as I clearly know myself you to be. Its like an intense river, trying to erode the solid image of you in order to create a vast cavern between me, you and possibility something great. But then again, my brain has always questioned its choices, never truly happy with decisions its made, and never truly happy when it with changes when my will folds. And now the worst question comes to mind. Do I even deserve a chance? Because I am far more indecisive than I let the world see. I want you with all my heart in one second, and then next I could be admiring the form of another, imagining myself defiling another human being, and wanting nothing else but that moment of pleasure and another notch in my belt. I know that I don't want anyone else emotionally, and that's more than I could say for the last decade of my life. But half of me fears that lust is just a part of me. It's in my family history, and while I want to do better than the men before me, I can't say I have the best will power. This anger that builds up, it truly stems from the weaknesses and deformities in my character that I don't believe anyone should have to deal with. I am always chasing an image of what I want to be, but I am just not there. But even if achieve my ideal self, is it even good enough for you? This anger that builds it, it is an attempt to destroy myself, because deep down, I wonder if what I am and what I want to be -something I have desired since I was 13, walking home from school with a person who I once called my best friend, as I saw he deformed into something that I didn't know if I could ever associate myself with, but accepted that I was from perfect myself - is good enough for you. Honestly two years ago I was stable, it was insane. I walked around with the mentality that either you could handle me, or just simply fuck off. The idea of changing for someone else, especially for a significant other, was insane. I never worried If I was good enough for someone else, because that wasn't my priority. My priorities were to achieve something bigger than anything else in my life. But now I look at you, and wonder if I should smooth down those rough edges(more like impaling spikes) in order to give you someone that might be better for you. Maybe I should be a better man for you. But is it truly being a better man? Would it be me? Which is something that's so important to me. But then again, is trying to become this ideal self really being me? In the end of the day, are any of these choices what you would really want, and who am I to decide what you want?
TL;DR 
When you cross my mind, you remind me that no matter how hard I try, I'll never have the right answer, and nothing enfuriates me than a question I can't answer and a decision I can't make, because it remind me of all my flaws, and nothing sets me back more than that. So the only thing I can do is push you out of my brain and just go with the current plan, since all I can do is stick with Plan A. 
TL;DR the TL;DR
The thought of you stresses me out about my life choices to the point that I want to punch myself, but I just end up a little less confidently in the same direction prior to this all."

Cornell should be ashamed of the worker conditions in the dishrooms. I worked in one on West for about a year and during my time there the workers in the dishrooms were all invariably immigrants who didn't speak English, incredibly elderly, retarded, or some combination of the three. They work incredibly hard all day scraping half-eaten food off people's plates in the heat and noise and get paid minimum wage for it. It's honestly the most depressing thing I've ever seen. Next time you're in a dining hall, make sure you appreciate the people who clean your dishes, because I guarantee you no matter how much you complain you would way rather just do your problem set than do that job. And if you see one, smile and say hi...you'll probably be the first person from Cornell to in years."

 Whenever I go to the Cornell Confessions page and I notice that the admins are putting up new entries I always rush to write in a very humorous or troll post.

I get a sick pleasure from knowing that I made made many people laugh with my jokes. But you want to know the sad part? This page is the only social stimulation I get apart from buying coffee in the morning. 

There have been entire weeks where I've gone without talking to anyone. My parents have shunned me, my brothers ignore me, my friends have all moved on. I have no one. The only thing that gets me through the day is composing some of these jokes for mine and your pleasure. Sometimes I just sit in an empty classroom laughing at my own jokes.

I'm pretty sure I've never truly connected with another human being. Sure, I'm good at making people laugh, or imitating them, faking emotions, but I don't think anyone has ever truly understood me. I hear people talk about their best friends, their girlfriends, their siblings, their parents and I've never had a relationship like they've described. Twice in my life, I've completely cut myself off from a group of people, burning all bridges. I felt nothing, no missing, no sadness for the loss of friends. People have died, moved away, broken up with me, been dumped by me, and I've never felt any real sadness. I feel a twinge of guilt from not missing them, and then nothing. If my parents were to die tomorrow, I can't say that I would be terribly sad. I like to think I would miss them, but I don't know.

 If I never saw anyone I've ever met again, I can't say that I would be that much different. Honestly, the inconvenience of building new relationships would be the worst thing for me, but that's all it would be. An inconvenience. I read books about love, companionship, compassion for fellow man, but I can't bring myself to feel it. Hell, I've had this conversation with a few people, even doctors, and they all just nod along with it. They just listen, not contribute, not problem solve, just sit there like a sponge, absorbing the information, waiting to get back to their significant other, to their spouse, their buddy, their child, their friend.

My spouse is moving away unexpectedly after he quit his grad program due to lack of funding despite his incredibly high GPA and incredible commitment to his program. We just can't afford the debt on a degree the median income for which will not allow us to pay back the debt easily while dealing with my undergrad debt as well and helping my impoverished in-laws as they age. We were counting on a scholarship but the money was re-allocated because the department is struggling and the application is just outdated bullshit on the admissions website. My spouse hasn't been able to find a job for several months and I can't afford to pay his student loans and take care of us on just my fellowship. I will be alone here for several years while he is with his family on the other side of the continent. My parents are dead and I have few friends here so I worry about how my life will proceed now that I have so little here for me. I find myself idealizing about jumping into the gorges and stop myself after realizing that, even if I could afford a life insurance policy, it would be voided if I committed suicide. I wish I had never come here. The educational opportunity for me is not worth the horrific stress that has been brought upon my spouse and me by being in an isolated area with no other opportunities. So many people who I mentor here and back at home who are struggling with financial and educational disadvantages look up to me so I'm afraid to quit my program but it now seems like that is an option I need to consider. I hate all of my options and have lost the ability to think strategically because I am so emotional. I think I'm giving up."

In fact, most on the opposing side were girls, while my side had both boys and girls.

However, I find it the most beautifully ironic that a girl that I had liked, and had spent a ton of my time talking with didn't even offer to vouch for my character. People TALK about sexual harassment, and hope you're DOING WELL, but DON'T KNOW what it truly entails for someone who didn't do anything. You have accusations thrown at you, and people look at you like you're a monster. Someone even called me a pig multiple times, and most of my """"friends"""" throughout my freshman semester left.

Tonight for the first time, suicide seriously crossed my path for the first time ever. I was completely sober, my social/financial/physical situation is completely normal.  Yet for some reason I couldn't help not wanting to exist anymore. While I realize it's extremely selfish and completely a ""waste of a human being"" thought, I still briefly felt unwanting of a life.  I've made so many friends at Cornell but all of my relationships seems superficial, either I feel like they use me for money/kindness, or I feel like they dislike me as a person but put up with me for convenience. I'm by no means attractive, but I've set my standard to high and will never be able to have a relationship because I refuse to date anyone who isn't completely out of my league,  I've been rejected from everything ive applied to (excluding Cornell). These problems are all temporary and simply superficial and incomparable to someone who suffers from chronic starvation or paralysis,  etc. But in my twisted mind, it warrants me to no longer want this life.

I'm always ""too busy"" to grab lunch or dinner, and no one notices or thinks twice.  Every time I don't eat something, even if it's healthy, I'm proud of myself.  This is a scary struggle that people avoid talking about, and I don't think it gets enough attention.  Sure, many people have many different problems, but why are people so scared to talk about anorexia and bulimia?  Maybe if people talked about it more, I wouldn't be so afraid of telling my friends what I'm going through.  Maybe I could get help."

I feel like when we were first about to become friends we both ended up joining an organization that took up a ton of time. So talking to you and contacting you was easy because we could always bring up the work we were doing and I thought it was fun and that we were friends. But things have slowed down and when I should have been happy I was just super depressed because I feared we'd just fall out of touch until the club picked up again. And we did... And I miss you... So maybe text me if you wanna grab dinner? And we could work towards being actual friends."

I've been seeing all of these posts about fighting back against sexual assault recently, and I just want to make one thing very clear to everyone: Cornell does not care about rape or its victims. It cares about one thing and one thing only: not getting sued.

Sure, individuals might care-- counselors, professors, etc. But the university itself could care less about anything other than lawsuits or negative publicity. It is run by self-serving jerks and idiotic bureaucrats. Otherwise, they would crack down on the frats and this would be less of a problem.

Same with mental health. They claim to care about depression, but newsflash: They don't. Kind of sucks to pay 50 k a year to attend this place, doesn't it?

Oh, and don't get me started on the police department. They are complete imbeciles who were barely able to catch a couple of teenage paintballers and have neither the intellect nor dedication to actually accomplish anything significant."

Being unhappy and doing badly in classes at Cornell is knowing you're wasting TONS of your parents money and letting them down. All while being stuck because transferring to a state school is just further having wasted money and losing the reputation that comes with an ivy name, and the pride your parents felt from having a kid there. And, y'know. Bad grades just sort of means that you can't get in as a transfer to a similar tier school. Long story short, I wish I had gone to any of the other schools I was accepted to."

""I remember the first time I met you.  We and some other friends walked down to Barton during O-week for the bouncy castle party.  You were very quiet, introverted, but actually really funny.  I didn't ask you too many questions since you didn't seem comfortable with me doing so.
I've talked to you a few more times since then, and admittedly, even gone out of my way just to see you in the library to say hi and study stuff next to you.
The only thing is, I actually don't know anything about you.I know where you're from, I know what instruments you dabbled in, but nothing about your hometown, your likes, dislikes; nothing about you.  I've never asked because you never seemed willing to tell me and I never wanted to pry and make you feel uncomfortable.  But it's honestly driving me crazy.  Like, it's the biggest distraction.
I really hope that you don't feel like I'm being creepy, but goddammit, if I am, I wish you'd just tell me so that I wouldn't have to be so worried about making you uncomfortable.  I can understand you not wanted to talk; I hate talking too, actually.

For any given semester, there's always these same group of people (~4-5) that I see every week. It's just the way my schedules and their schedules work out. They always seem familiar to me, and I always seem familiar to them. We always exchange some sort of weird eye contact. I wish I could meet these people.

I'm a senior and I'm so lonely I can't stand it. My support system is nonexistent anymore, my family needs my support, and I've always been the high functioning member of the family so they've never been any support for me, only a drain (not that they can help it). For the years while I was here I made friends but the majority of them graduated last year (I started class of 2014). The friends I have left are more like acquaintances, coworkers... I can't talk to them any more... and when I do it definitely can't be about things that are bothering me because they all have their own fucked up lives and don't have time for mine... I've tried so hard to be a thoughtful caring person, and in the end, what's left? No one acknowledges when I do something for them, but god forbid I lose my temper or say something harsh. No one wants to actually know me, they only want me around when I'm doing things for them and they never reciprocate... and in the end, I have no one."

I am the OP from #3832.  All right.  I get it now.  Want to know what made me realize I was wrong?  It was your comment, [redacted].  But I’d like to argue that I am not an abysmally stupid fuck, but rather an abysmally uninformed fuck.  Based on the information I had, Cornell doesn’t even have to let the accused rapist know who accused them.  As far as I can tell, that’s actually true, which is fine with me (rapists should be treated like the dogs they are; I personally give zero shits about whether they get due process).  But I hadn’t read Section 6.4 until now, and I’m appalled.  Although many levels of punishment are written into the code, the final decision about which one is applied to the rapist is TOTALLY in the hands of the administration.  There’s no concrete “rape=prison” written into the code.  In fact it’s more like “rape=whatever punishment the administration is in the mood for on a given day”.  Now THAT is wrong.  I apologize for my earlier post, and I want you to know that I’m going to talk to Skorton about this.  And if change doesn't happen this year, our new female president might be more receptive when she takes over.  You keep spray-painting mattresses, and I’ll do my best on my end."

To those who do not understand what sexual assault does to a person, I like to share my story. I was 9 years old when an older student on the bus home pulled my pants down and forcibly fingered me and forced my face onto his penis. No, I didn't scream. I was to scared, I knew nothing about my body or what was going on. I cried as he told me this is what good girls do. It happened again before he switched bus routes. 
 I felt so violated, helpless, and lost. I told no one because upbringing said anything sexual was shameful. I feared to be touched, I'd cry during physicals for years. It is still ever present in my mind, sorry society it doesn't just disappear. It still effects me, I hate masturbating and I have little desire for sex (even though I have a loving, understanding fiance). I also have anxiety disorder on top of that. 
 Unlike some, I do not see my abuser walking around our campus and not being held accountable. That is what we must change. So do not take what happens to so many of my sisters and brothers lightly. Stop the rape jokes and tear down this rape culture."

""
Ok, here’s the deal:  I’m sick and tired of your shit.  Yes, you fools who put a mattress in front of Day Hall with the words “Skorton, here is your oral warning, we’re fighting back” spray-painted on it.  First of all, it’s written, not oral, you abysmally stupid fucks (at least pretend you’re intelligent enough to go to Cornell).  Secondly, what the hell are you even talking about?  Cornell has a highly developed system in place to address sexual assault.  In fact, it goes so far as to remove the suspected rapist’s “innocent until proven guilty” rights, which I actually appreciate (in my opinion, rapists deserve no rights; if I were in charge, rape would merit a life sentence in prison).  But all of this leaves me wondering what your complaint is.  I have no doubt that there are improvements that could be made to the judicial system, but how about you address them like civilized human beings?  Like maybe in writing, or at Skorton’s open office hours?  But I must say, I’d like to see what kind of pointless, juvenile way you choose to “fight back”, you dim fuckers.  I laugh at your empty threat written on a soggy mattress.  On a different note, do you want to know what the worst part of this whole situation is?  That it’s impossible to take the other side without getting torn apart.  I just watched on the Overheard at Cornell Facebook page as one guy with good intentions stood up against everyone else (he was arguing for due process in the trials of rapists, which is a valid point).  And then I watched him get shot down.  But it wasn’t about the quality of his argument, it was about the people he was de facto supporting.  When he said “but what about due process for rapists?”, everyone fired back with “so you support rape?”.  That wasn’t what he was saying, and that isn’t what I’m saying.  He and I (as well as every other decent male on this campus) hate rapists with every fiber of our beings.  So if you want to involve the student body in your campaign, you’re doing it wrong.  You’re not leaving any room for conversation to take place, and you’re turning people away from your cause.  And to the people who left the mattress message:  grow up.  When you do, I’ll pick up a banner and join the protest.""

[*sigh*

You don't hear about the written letters, or the survivors talking to the administration about their respective crimes, OP. You likely only hear about when survivors go to court because the administration silences the survivor, or when the media gets involved. It's severely under-reported, and the administration would rather have the survivor shut up about it. The event yesterday, as well as the tell-tale mattress represents a turning point in a dialogue that was silenced by university administrations across the nation. If you ""hate rapists with every fiber of your being,"" then join those who fight against rape culture. ]"

""When I was 4 or 5, my mom had me lie to my dad about her meeting up with another man. I realized what was going on and did nothing to stop it. She justified so many lies to me and I started doing it as such a young age. I can remember lying to other kids about ridiculous facts about who I was and where I had been. I'm a pathological liar. I can't stop. I can't even be honest with therapists. I know that some people can tell, and it's really embarrassing. I've told so many conflicting lies to so many different groups of people that I honestly don't know what the truth is sometimes. 

I've remained emotionally distant in most of my adult relationships. I feel like I'm always trying to hide some deep truth about myself, when really I'm just so insecure with whatever's left of my true identity. I'm afraid my lying is going to prevent me from ever truly connecting with another person. Last year I let someone in just a little, then I pushed her away and blamed her for the relationship failing.

So, I've tried having a relationship with a few different girls now, and each time it ends with me getting bored a month or so in, and dumping them. The high school version of myself thought having a girlfriend would solve all of my problems. He was wrong. Luckily, one thing I have learned is that having a girl doesn't make you necessarily better, but the converse is also true. So, I'd say my confession now is that I don't know what to do. I'm contented not having a girlfriend, but I don't know what to work toward anymore. I thought life was about love, but I believe less and less in it each day. And that's fine. It's not in a depressed way. Hell, I was hella depressed before all this. I guess what I'm trying to say is that I always had thought the point of life was to find someone to love, and give them everything. Outside of making money for the hell of it, I see no point of getting a job. I feel a bit lost. Not sad lost, nor lonely so much. It's more like what I felt like the first time I realized I didn't have any strong religious beliefs. Sure, I like to think there is a higher power, but inside I know I just think that to make myself feel better. So here I am. Sitting typing into my laptop in my underwear, preparing for job interviews. And I don't know what I'm supposed to do."

""I am a pedophile.

This does not mean I've ever acted upon my urges. It merely refers to the emotional and physical attraction I experience toward prepubescents. I am attracted to them in precisely the same way most people reading this are attracted to others around their age. Knowing that I am this way depresses me a great deal because it is something I must always keep a secret; I fear that if I tried to confide this to a friend or family member, they would never speak to me again. I even know that many who read this will already be fuming because I understand completely how despicable you think this is. I can feel your hatred through the screen. I've even read stories of people like me (and there are many, believe me) going to see psychiatrists and getting turned away for no more reason than contempt. This is not even mentioning how little research has been done on the condition because c'mon, do you think pedophiles report themselves knowing the stigma attached?

I do not consider this a mental illness or some perverted fetish; this is my entire sexual orientation and I've known it since I was 18 (22 now). Whenever I am in the presence of an adorable little angel that I have a crush on, I am stricken with a pang of deep sadness. I want nothing more than to confess my feelings to them, to take them out to dinner, to play and laugh with them, to snuggle up and watch a movie with them. This will never happen of course because these desires make me, to the rest of the world, a filthy beast, the scum of the earth.

To the admin: I understand if you choose not to post this. In fact, I expect what I've typed above to be thrown into the void due to its nature.

I know it's a small act, but the fact that you liked that thing I posted on my Facebook earlier (I say ""thing"" to avoid making my identity too obvious) really made me happy. I can't wait til I get to see you and talk to you again in person."
4309,2014-09-29 15:11:45,"3791
There's a person I stopped talking to 3 years ago, around the time I started college.
I got scared and thought he didn't want to talk to me anymore first, but I remember seeing him back at our high school during the first year. Could have sworn he was looking at me from across the room, in a way that might have been wondering why I didn't go up to him, but it was pretty far away, so I could be mistaken.
I kinda want to try to contact him again, but I'm scared."

My parents cut me off the middle of sophomore year due to fractures in our relationships with each other. As a result, I've resorted to male stripping during vacations and weekends while keeping a part-time job during school to make ends meet. After tuition and other expenses are paid for, I barely have enough money to eat. So I mooch off of friends and sneak into Okenshields whenever I can. Sorry for stealing. And for stripping. Ok maybe not stripping. But sorry for stealing."

I know you are going through a bad breakup, but I really like you and your bengladeshi accent turns me on every time. I can’t tell if you flirt with me or not, but when you called me beautiful the other day (even though you were smiling when you said it) , it really made my day. So, stop talking about your ex with my best friend and instead talk about me! There’s a reason why she is your EX. I will treat you better than that bitch and she definitely did not deserve your love. You know who I am, so make your move already, I am waiting!"

I was in the stacks the other day and I let loose a silent, but deadly one. Unfortunately, just seconds later this really hot girl I know and have a crush on sees me from the aisle. She began to make her way through the book shelves towards me. Unfortunately, she didn't know about the ringed fortress of a 3 foot radius that I had set up just moments earlier. Suffice it to say that when she had come within range of my noxious gases, she couldn't penetrate any further. She wrinkled her nose, grew red in the face, and walked away in absolute disgust. If you're reading this, please, please, please know that I still have an insane crush on you and am ashamed of what I've done. I really like you....but now I can't even come near you......"

I just want you to know that I haven't stopped thinking about you. From gazing up at the stars on Libe Slope together to hanging out and talking in my room until we could hear birds chirping, we had such fun times--and those memories will stay with me forever. I was too insecure back then, and I think you were too, since you could've made a move so many times but never did.. and that frustration drove me to pursue someone else. I'm sorry if I hurt you. I'm glad to see that you have a girlfriend now, and I hope she gives you the love that you deserve. I wish it wasn't too late for me to give you that now, but I really wish you two the best. You honestly were one of the best guys I'd met here at Cornell."

Recently, I have decided that I am going to end my life when I am like 40 or 45 years old. I'm not depressed or anything. I just want to be in control of when my life ends. However, if my life ended tomorrow, I honestly wouldn't care. I just don't see the point of living. I don't see the value in my life or anyone else's life for that matter. I don't know if that makes me a selfish or bad person. But, what I do know is that my life has significantly improved since making this decision. I am living each day more fully and trying new things because after all I have only 20 or so years left. On bad days, I just say to myself ""only 20 more years of this sh*t. You can do this."" The only down side to this decision is that I can't get close to anyone because then I might get caught up in feelings and such. I haven't been able to tell anyone about my decision because I'm afraid they will think I'm crazy or depressed or something. It feels good to finally get this off my chest. Cheers and thanks for reading!"

 There are so many things we take for granted in this world. Our health. Our parents. Our security. Whether or not the phone call or conversation you make with a family member will be the last one. I didn't really understand the phrase ""live every moment like it's your last"" until a few months ago. But not for my sake: for my mother's. She became ill and I feared she wouldn't make it though, but she did, thankfully. Even though she's much better now, I'm still afraid of losing her. I'm afraid that one day I'll call and she won't pick up. From today, until the end, I'm going to cherish every moment. Every laugh. Every conversation. Every piece of wisdom she has to offer me. We all have to die at some point, but I'm not ready for her to go yet. I'm not sure I ever will be."

I never could really admit that that was the kind of relationship I had been in up until now, months after the break off. And I only manged to really realize this because of my current boyfriend. Although it was a painful realization, I don't have time to be sad because my boyfriend is so good at making me happy and feel satisfied with everyday life, despite my not-so-great past.

I really wish I had gotten into Princeton. I spend at least a half hour every day thinking about what I could have done differently to have gotten in. At first, I thought I was crazy for doing this, but I've come to realize that it's completely rational. Cornell is cold, in the middle-of-nowhere, and filled with douchebags, alcoholics, and sycophants. Throw in the indignity of being seen as a safety school, awful housing, and crippling bureaucracy, and well, it's just a miserable place. I'm abroad this semester and can't stand the thought of returning. Like Jesus Christ, I'd even settle for UChicago or Northwestern."

I'm lonely and I want to be in a relationship. I'm a really strong minded, independent girl and I'm aware that I don't need a guy to make me happy. That said, I've just never felt comfortable with casual hookups and I have needs that I want to be fulfilled. I know everyone's super busy and stressed here (so am I) but I wish I could find a guy that wants to be in a relationship. Yes, relationships take time and effort but I feel that if two people are on the same page they can live their own lives working on meeting their goals and still be together. So not having time is just a bullshit excuse. I am not without flaws, but I am pretty, smart, down to earth; I know what I have to offer and I don't understand why on this big, huge campus, this big, huge earth, I or anyone else should be lonely."

Did I mention she sleeps nude too?! And sometimes without the blanket covering her?! I don't know what to do anymore…...

This whole year I've been telling myself I want a relationship with someone, that I'm ready to start building a foundation to spend the rest of my life with someone, but now that that chance is actually here I keep looking for reasons to run away from it because I'm secretly scared. I also can't stop thinking I'd be tying myself down too early, losing opportunities if I meet someone better, which I hate myself for even thinking. Plus then I'd feel guilty flirting. Oh, and there's the complication that this guy is my brother's best friend, so if we do date and it doesn't work out that's all kinds of awkward, plus it'd be long distance while I'm still in college. On the other hand we're already great friends and can talk about anything. He's shown he's willing to be there for me pretty much no matter what, so honestly what's stopping me?"

It not only saddens me, but scares me to death. This brought me to the realization that our relationship is a huge part of my big dreams and ambitions too.

I plan on shaving it the instant it becomes too noticeable. I know many of you will say it's about the confidence factor in men that makes them attractive. But honest question, if there are two identical twins but one is completely bald and the other is a regular looking guy with no signs of balding, and they're both equally matched in confidence, personality, etc. which would you prefer? It's questions like these that make me consider buying a really good wig. I mean if women can get boob implants, why can't I get a wig?"

""Dear Person,

Because you chose not to listen and keep arguing bullshit knowing that there's a truth behind my words, I will tell you here. If you see it, great. If not, let my feelings and thoughts rest here. 

You are too easily irritated by the simplest of things and call them stupid. As you say, """"stupid people do stupid things."""" Sure that may be true, but your rigid perception on life closes your mind off to several other possibilities. You stick to crap that doesn't exist here in this world. Even if you hate groups of people, for example, freshmen, you have no right to ostracize them from your narcissistic world. If people do stupid things, you shouldn't be overflowing like the pacific ocean. I really don't give a fuck how you perceive people. I don't judge people based on their actions solely. 

You are the kind of person that talks so much shit and insults people thinking that many are beneath you. Bitch please... I could shut you down. Being that I have to deal with you everyday, I keep my mouth shut. It may even be the case that my fists would want to do the talking for me. 

Let it be known: You are no one to dictate anyone's happiness. You are no one to criticize anyone's happiness. You are no one to dictate anyone's lifestyle. You are no one to criticize anyone's lifestyle. So please do me a favor and shut the fuck up. My business clearly isn't yours. I'd avoid you but it's virtually impossible. 

And then you wonder why you are alone... even if you don't care, which is clearly bullshit, you push people away with imposing upon them your views. Stop that shit... seriously. I really don't care. 

Advice: If you change who you are, life will be so much easier and you won't be depressed nor unhappy. Maybe, you'll even attract friends. For now, perish in your void of self-ignorance. You stupid fucking piece of dick-shitted cunt looking ass motherfucker. Ugh... 

Sincerely,
Someone who has observed you closely for sometime now.

The other problem is that the Asian girls kind of don't accept me. It's kind of hard being Indian on this campus. The only other Indian people I've met are straight from India, or they're really whitewashed if they're from the States. Life is just too hard >< I give up sigh...

""It's strange. It's as though I can feel myself slipping away.

My mind gets easily caught in patterns, patterns of their own design that spiral downward and into themselves. I've become easier to anger. No, more than that, I've started to look for reasons to lash out. For that, I am sorry to the people around me; I am likely being unfair. Moreover, I have been silent. This anonymous confession is the closest I've gotten to asking for help. Yet I don't feel like I can trust our campus counselors; I've heard more than a few bad things. Perhaps I am simply too proud, or worse yet too ashamed.

Still, there's a cold, dull ache that settles into my chest when I stare out into the night. Slowly but surely, I feel like I'm drifting out into a void.

         But in the end I end up fixating on them--whether it's comparing myself to my very successful peers who have surpassed me by miles in all aspects of life, or thinking about how two decades of emotional abuse that my mother bore throughout her arranged marriage resulted in her basically being reduced from a sweet and loving woman into a violent, depressed border-line alcoholic, or how my dad fathered a few bastards and has his mistress living around the block from my little brothers and how he loves my cousins more than us, or the one time I was sexually abused by an older cousin when I was 5, or how my family is now near bankruptcy and I'm partly to blame, or how I fucked up academically beyond repair. 
     It literally feels like a heavy weight has been placed on my chest and it's slowly extinguishing what little will power I had. It's at those moments I find a quiet spot to myself, close my eyes, and let the tears flow. I've considered suicide, but have successfully overcome the sweet allure of that easy path in light of the trauma it would inflict on my brothers and mother. It's so difficult to not feel emasculated when I cry, but it's so difficult to resist crying. 
     I feel like a self-entitled loser. But I have no idea how to battle my psychological issues or my real life ones. I'm deathly scared of being diagnosed as a narcissistic, bipolar maniac..I don't want to be labelled as mentally ill. It would just crush me even further into this desolate pit I've dug for myself."""

My dad's Indian and my mom's Chinese. I'm really scared about what's going to happen to my family if India and China decide to go to war (border tensions have surged recently). Both my parents are 2nd generation immigrants and are pretty much completely assimilated in America. But if the two nations go to war, I'm scared they'll get divorced and that I'll have to meiotically split into my Indian self and my Chinese self. I DONT WANT MY FAMILY TO SPLIT UP."

She's helped me through so much, and has helped me become a better person. The time that's passed since we started dating have been the best in my life. I can't imagine my life without her now. I know she feels the same way towards me, and I can only hope that I can continue to prove that I'm worthy of her love."

Some of the CS majors at this school are the most annoying and self-centered people I've ever met. Just because what you are studying is in high demand does not mean you are the smartest person on campus, and it certainly does not mean you get to look down on everyone else who is not studying CS. They are studying something else because it's not within their interests, not because they're ""not smart enough."" Get over yourselves."

You have some amazing timing. Honestly speaking here, if you never messaged me, I could have been over all this. I could have been happy right now. But now you are right there, back in my head, and no matter what I do, I can't get you out, when that's all I want to do. Yesterday I thought I finally came to grips with the way I feel, and even with you trying to return in a place you clearly can't fit, I could somehow find a way to deal with everything I am going through . But yesterday, I didn't wake up with the first thought in my head being that I love you."

I want you back so badly.  How did I err?  I tried my best every day to be the best partner,  I'm sorry if I ever hurt you and didn't realize it.  I'm sorry for anything I might have ever done wrong.  I just wanted to show you that the perfect lover/friend/partner existed and that it had my name.  However, it's not my place to call you and beg for your return since you're the one who broke it off.  We were so perfect hours before and then all of a sudden...you said it was over. I don't understand.  I never did. That is the only part of you I never figured out."

I just wanted to say you're an awesome bro. Especially for what you did for me the other night when we went into that strip club and the manager told us to ""look, but don't touch"" and I end up touching her maaanny times. You're the only person ik who'd have my back in that situation and help me fight off those bouncers and run for it. You didn't leave me hangin brah. I appreciate it. And the next time you're girlfriend comes on to me? I promise I won't bang her. Cross my heart."

2) Dance dirty with girls in front of you

The following words capture my low opinion of my heritage: I just hate my ethnic family background. Everybody that I know is related to someone special or famous in history. I've got white friends who claim to be descendants of Charlemagne, George III, and  Warren Buffett, Chinese friends who claim to be related to Mao, Qin Shi Huang, Jackie Chan,  Mongolian and Turkish friends who claim descent from Genghis and Osman, black friends who say they're related to T'oussant L'overture, Sundeita Keita and Evander Holyfield, Indian friends who just say: Akbar. Ashoka. Gandhi. 'nuff said. and Latino friends who say they're descended from BOTH Montezuma AND Hernan Cortes. The fact is all these people have such noble and great bloodlines. Me? I come from the cultural backwaters of a people who've basically stayed in one place since the Stone Age. All you'll find in my ancestry is a bunch of nose-picking, ass-scratchers. I feel so...humiliated when people ask me my ethnicity...a bunch of no-names. All I've inherited from them is a small penis. Thanks ancestors. You're the best. smh..."

I am struggling more this year than I have any other, and I don't know if I will be able to turn it around.  The stress I feel just makes me want to lie down in the grass and disappear, or just run away from everything and never return.  I feel like I am a failure and that I am failing myself, my parents, and everyone else.  I suck at my major and its too late to change anything, and the only things I'm good at are impossible to make money at unless you are literally the best at it, which I'm definitely not.
I just wish my s/o could marry me after graduation.  I would make the best trophy partner- taking care of our home and kids and all of my s/o's needs, and I know they would be secure enough financially in the future to support myself and our children.  But alas, I'm pretty sure we are done by graduation.

Cornell is supposed to be very LGBT friendly, and that's not wrong. Everyone I've met who finds out I'm gay has been perfectly fine with it. My question is, why is it SO hard to find other gay guys?! I feel like there are almost none, or I'm looking in the wrong places. The only way to find other gay guys here is by using Tinder or some other equally desperate ""dating service"", but where does that leave a guy who actually wants a relationship and not a one-nighter?

And occasionally one will send me a text: ""How's Cornell?"". How am I to respond? They want a yes, they want to know I'm okay and move onto whatever interesting stories currently rivet their lives.

All I do is bother people that don't want anything to do with me. Like, what happens now? Do I press forward and ignore these people, or am I supposed to fizzle out of of memory and go die in a corner? It's so fucking frustrating because people suddenly give a damn about victims of abuse and neglect, but God forbid you have one right in front of you, trying to work through said damage with you. With the thousands of people that are here, it's disgusting how little room there is for real healing. Even mroe so how Cornell can throw God knows how much money into a publicity stunt 5 miles away and shortens our school year every year.

I had an incredible year at Cornell last year so I was sad when summer came along because I didn't want to leave what had become my favorite place in the world. Even though I loved my job this summer, I was lonely and couldn't wait to be back to see all my friends again. Ever since coming back, though, it just hasn't been the same; the loneliness hasn't gone away. I think being away from all the wonderful people I met here for three months over the summer just made me feel too distant. I can feel myself retreating into my head, having more and more trouble actually talking to people without getting shy or nervous- even my close friends sometimes! During the day, it's not so bad because my mind is busy focusing on class, but in the evenings I feel really lonely, which just makes me get even more stressed and down. I really want to meet people because I think that would help, but parties aren't exactly conducive to nice, quiet conversation. (Tbh I really miss this time of freshman year, when everyone wants to meet and be friends with everyone else) I don't want to go the whole year crying myself to sleep, but I just don't really know what to do. Part of the trouble is that in some ways, there's nothing really wrong, and I can't find a solution to a problem if I'm just getting worked up and stressed about nothing."

""Recently I overheard an older lady speaking to another lady about how women are still so degraded by society in that they are addressed as """"bitches"""" so I wanted to make a PSA and let everyone know about the three different varieties of the """"bitch"""". 

The first kind of """"bitch"""" is the most common: the type of """"bitch"""" that is screamed across College Ave as a freshman girl who believes she is more inebriated than she really is (after half a Keystone) identifies another girl or group of girls that she lives across the hall from in Low Rise 6. Usually the word """"bitch"""" is paired with a tasteful """"LOVE YOU"""" or """"HEYYYY"""" before the sacred B is uttered. This """"bitch"""" is also used to refer to powerful women (and homosexual men in some cases) who exude charisma, and a seeming disinterest in the opinions of others (The """"I don't care what my haters think they just be jealllll"""" variety). This """"bitch"""" is usually paired with a tasteful """"fierce"""" or """"hot"""" added before the sacred B is uttered. Examples include Beyonce, Queen Elizabeth, Karl Lagerfeld, etc. This variety of the """"bitch"""" is harmless. Actually, it's a huge compliment (I would love to be called a bitch tbh). 

The second variety of the """"bitch"""" is someone who is actually a bitch. This bitch is the bitch that stole your boy(/girl)friend or the bitch that stole your parking spot at Soul Cycle or the bitch who """"accidentally"""" dropped his/her Pumpkin Spice Latte on your MacBook.This is a real BITCH. Notice how I have stopped putting """"bitch"""" in quotations. Yeah, because that guy/girl is actually a bitch. This bitch is meant to hurt. This bitch is usually used with no preface. When the perpetrator is a real bitch, the following words are used to describe the variety of bitch they are: f*cking bitch, stupid bitch, whore ass bitch, biggest bitch in the land, wicked bitch of the east, bitchqueen of the bitchuniverse, etc. Let us clarify that this malicious form of bitch is still not anything close to sexist. A man or woman can be a bitch. If they do something to you that is rude, inconsiderate, and just stupid, they are a bitch. Simple as that. In no way, shape, or form is this supposed to be a knock on the social status of women. 

The third variety is the female dog. In some cases, humans resemble  female dogs in which case other humans mistake him/her for a female dog. Though bitch is not used to describe a female dog in most parts of the country, some people still do legitimately use bitch in this fashion. This is absolutely harmless.

There you go. Your guide on the three types of bitches. #yourewelcome

Okay. So in my personal situation, this isn't a story, this is real life, and I'm the one who has to deal with the aftermath. But it's easier to put it this way. I HATE amnesia story arcs. They piss me the fuck off. SO. FUCKING. MUCH. Why do people think that's cool? Take a perfectly good character with a perfectly good story and then for some goddamn reason decide to give them amnesia?! It renders EVERYTHING meaningless, all of their development, everything that happened that shaped who they are... It's traumatizing for the people who have to deal with it. I absolutely fucking hate it. It's sadistic, it's rude, it's annoying, just... FUCK!!!!!!!!! How the hell am I gonna pick up these pieces? Fucking bullshit...."

These past few days, I haven't been able to to really study or focus on anything at all. I have a pretty specific reason, but I'm afraid to say why since it's really easy to identify who's writing this if I say it. I don't know why I'm so afraid; it's not like I'm going to die, and I normally don't have anxiety problems. I jump at everything now, and I tremble once in a while even when I'm warm. Sometimes in the middle of the night I wake up in a panic and I just stare at the ceiling for the next few hours until I have to get up. Sometimes I don't even remember that this is happening until my stomach drops for some reason, and then I remember why I'm scared. It'll end soon, but I hate the waiting so much, and I really want to just lie in bed and watch TV instead of going to class."

I am a computer science major, and I love my major so much that it's almost like a shelter, or comfortable zone, to me in Cornell. This probably means there's something wrong with my general experience as an undergrad on campus. I feel in my CS community, I'm not judged by my race, look, attractiveness, etc. I don't need to worry about not being involved in greek life or anything. I'm not interested in joining a frat at all, but even if I did, I'm kinda sure I wouldn't get anything. I'm free to choose the type of social life I want - SOBER, chill, respective, friendly, inclusive. There have been micro aggressions that happened, but I can tell that faculty and some fellow students around me are definitely paying effort to eliminate bias in the community because they just care about it so much. However, when I'm not in my CS or engineering community, it's a completely different world. I can't agree more with #3649 - everyone here is experiencing a different Cornell. We are divided, and I can't view the whole Cornell as one community at all."

""Dear ex-boyfriend,
         Since you basically exiled me from your life and forbid me from seeing you, I figured I should let you know a few things. I didn't know how to get back in touch with you, especially since it's only been a few days since our breakup. But I'm going to reveal a few things here for the world to see:
      First, I should let you know: That huge mess you found in your bathroom? THAT WAS ME, BITCH. I was so happy I had to take a massive shit while you were yelling at me and flinging used condoms in my face. Right after we broke up I went to your bathroom and released the aforementioned waste left over from last night's spicy chimichanga and chicken tikka all over your porcelain throne. So happy I didn't even bother sitting down to do so. How did it feel to clean that shit up brah? I made sure the toilet paper stuck to your mirror btw. Make sure you scrub that thing real good haha. Or better yet, just get a completely new one ya big screwball.
      Second, I also stole your secret collection of gangsta-rap/Justin Bieber mixtapes you adore so much. I WILL make this  public knowledge.
      Third, I replaced your marijuana with grass my dog shit on and your pipes with my dildos (which I had to use almost EVERY SINGLE DAY of our 3 month relationship)
      Fourth, Brah what the hell? I've heard of guys collecting panties to show off their sexual exploits. But you actually KEEP your used condoms in a jar. GROSS. And then you had the audacity to fling them at me? What the hell was I thinking when I got with you?!
      Fifth, I will expose you for the lying, cheating, maniacal little twisted fuck you are. I'll make sure that when I'm done, my own dog won't want to copulate with you, you vile piece of trash.
     P.S. I'm telling everyone you banged a prostitute when you were 17 just to lose your virginity.
     P.P.S. I lied. Your peepee is actually pretty small.
     My prediction: Your ONLY girlfriend in the coming years will be your right hand. 

Now you know full well the meaning of the phrase:
""""Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned"""" 
--(N.B. This phrase is often wrongly attributed to the great playwright, William Shakespeare. In truth, it was not Shakespeare, but another prolific English playwright, William Congreve, who penned this great line)

Your only solace now is the sweet embrace of death, the great equalizer. Enjoy the rest of your meager existence, dog shit.

MUAHAHAHAHA

-Sincerely,
    your CRAZY ex-girlfriend"
4450,2014-09-16 18:48:29,"3650

I don't know what might've been going through in my head last year, but I should've said fuck no to your offer of being my roommate. Stop being a narcissistic piece of shit and get over yourself; you'll be happier that way. Otherwise, I might just sock you in the face. But for now, I'll just avoid you once in a while. I don't care if we don't talk. One more thing... just as much as I will stay out of your way, stay out of mine. BITCH!"

As a law school student, I have to say I am as proud to be a Cornellian as I am grateful that I didn't attend here for undergrad. The Greek system at Cornell is the most exclusionary, discriminatory, broken thing I've ever seen. It's hurting social life in this already isolated place immeasurably. Cornell is one of the most divided places I've seen, the only thing that brings us together is the shirts we wear, otherwise the experience is vastly different for different people, largely because of the Greek system. Us grad students stick together - Law, MBAs, PhDs, all have their unobstructed communities and we all hang out at Big Red Barn, Chapter House, etc. Sororities at Cornell are ridiculous. They select EXCLUSIVELY for attractiveness. The very top one has the hottest girls, essentially looks like a bunch of Fox News anchors, the second most selective a little less, and so on. Even Republicans have black people and hispanics, but you guys don't have ONE ugly girl in your top sorority. How is this even allowed? That's like hiring people based on physical attractiveness, and pretty much that alone. You're not too inclusive of other races either. The exact same goes for frats. And you only date people from a ""corresponding"" house? What kind of a British royalty-style inbreeding, fueled by an utterly offensive system of discrimination is that? I know a version of this goes on in most top schools, but I must say Cornell is truly at the forefront of community-ruining invidious redzoning of some of the smartest people on the planet."

Tonight, for the first time, I felt legitimately thirsty after looking at a girl's ass. It wasn't just any ass. This was godly. I took one look and i felt the urge to do so many things. I had Drake, Usher, and Romeo Santos playing in my head. This girl definitely had the perfect ass. I happen to see you walk-in into Kay so I'll take a wild guess and say you're a freshie. But at the time, you were drunk clinging onto someone's arm. If you are as nice as your ass is, wanna mingle? :'( This thirst is real."

But this time...It's so damn hard to concentrate with you running laps in the twisted labyrinth of my mind. Being a secret sex addict, I tried to just masturbate and lust my way to freedom. But I can't even get it up. It feels...sinful, wrong. I'm ashamed to even look at those websites--websites that might as well have bookmarked or made my homepage (LOL). For those of you who've had these...stirrings of the heart...is this normal? Is there anyway to quash these attractions and just go on with my business and focus on my work?

One of my parents and their friend came to visit over the weekend and despite having a lot of homework to do, I spent my entire Saturday and half of Sunday showing them around campus. I originally planned to spend this weekend doing as much as I could on a project because I didn't do any of it last week so now as a result, now I am stressing out about finishing this CS project on time. I had anticipated this, but didn't want to ruin the mood that my guests were having because of my selfishness so I didn't say anything. I appreciate them coming and visiting me and bringing me snacks from home. Throughout the weekend, I had to put on a face that seemed excited and carefree and eager for them to be here and not mention how much work I had, but I honestly would have rather them not come because now I am feeling really stressed. I also feel really conflicted inside because I am disappointed in myself for thinking this and know that my parent and parent's friend would have be so heartbroken to hear this. From an objective point of view, I am just wasting my time writing this confession when I could be finishing coding (which I was working on earlier) but it is so hard to keep my mind off how conflicted I feel inside and how difficult it is to see my code past the wall of tears in my eyes."

""Even though it was pretty much 2 years since we had first met, I still think about the great times we had together.  It was really great.  I was a freshman and didn't know what I do now.  I still probably don't regret my decision in not talking to you anymore, though.  You told people around me that you had wanted to talk but you never came to me after I had tried to with you once.  You just kept saying I don't know throughout the conversation and it really frustrated me.  You also never say what you think, which is essentially killing of all your character and personality that made me like you in the first place.  And suddenly, I get forced out of my dorm and I haven't seen you since.  I don't really talk to anyone from here much at all, I only hang out with friends that I've had at home now.  

I really feel that you didn't appreciate all the effort I put in caring about you and it still hurts me a lot. A hell of a lot sometimes.  I can deal with it really well a great majority of the time, but sometimes it drives me crazy when I let my thoughts run crazy at night when I don't sleep.  I keep on going back and forth with myself - trying to explain to myself why you acted how you did and why I was THAT much of a sucker to spend so much time giving you attention - either because you're insecure (as everyone is!), or because you wanted more constant attention. You told me once about how you were seeing another guy in high school because you thought he was attractive, and how it was 'short lived'.  And then later in the year you tell one of my sophomore friends that you weren't physically attracted to me, but that my personality was on par with your expectations.  BUT, I never got a chance to really """"see you"""" like the other guy did!  It makes you look kinda shallow that you would go for a guy (for even a short period of time) mostly for his looks, and not even give me a chance for my personality....that's so ridiculous imo
 
I wasn't made to spend all of my time and efforts to give you attention that you don't even give me.  You can like anyone you want, and that's fine if you're still torn over someone back at home.  He's obviously a great guy, and better than me, if you loved him.  However, if you don't like me on THAT level, the only other level that I have left with you is that of a friend/acquaintance.  If I'm not happy with our interactions on THIS friend level, I can't salvage our interactions, along with time during the first (and short part) of the second semesters we spent together.  I still don't understand how you would almost ignore me sometimes when I was with you in your room and then you're all frustrated and stressed out after I stopped coming in.  I did a lot of things back then to see how you would react because you're very difficult to read.  After a while, I understood how you piece thoughts and actions together.  I got inside your brain a bit, but I'm not you so it was still really complicated.  I'm not here to play with your emotions.

Save someone else all the pain.  It can still suck, along with all the other stuff that was and still is going on.  It's almost over.  You're kinda selfish and I have a love hate relationship with what you did to me.  Mostly hate now because I was really stupid and didn't know how to protect myself.  Idk if I should ever talk with you again."""

You're all that I need, you're essence would be my air.

You're incredibly gorgeous, in my eyes you're number one,
The best looking girl? That argument is closed and done.
You are gorgeous, but something even more beautiful took over my chest,
It was your personality, it really is quite the best.
When I'm having a bad day, when I'm mad or sad,
You'd turn me around, and you'd make me glad.
You'd make me laugh, have a good time, no matter how I felt,
Your personality is how you got my heart to melt.
Your laugh, so great, it's the best one for miles around,
When God created laughter, that's what he intended for it to sound.
You're so nice, too, no matter what you were never upset or mean,
All these great things are why I want to treat you as my queen.
Ask me """"Why do you love me?""""; really, you should, you ought,
I'll reply with the honest answer: """"How could you not?"""""""

They don't know about how fucked up our sex life is, no matter how much we try to make it work, because I'm asexual. They don't know how our miscommunications spiral into both of us feeling rejected by the other. They don't know about the nights I've spent crying over you. They don't know about the buildup of subtle slights, like always letting doors slam in my face despite me always holding them for you or running ahead of me when I'm too tired to match your speed, how it festers in my heart and when I try talking to you about them, you brush it off as me being a pampered princess.

They don't know about the times I've broken up with you and how you cried. They don't know about how I demanded roses out of you because I was desperate for any sign of lingering romance. They don't know about how I used to slap you out of frustration, and I don't think you knew that I meant it to hurt just a bit.

And they'll never see any of it, because they don't know our lives nearly as well as 'close friends' should, because you're the only one I ever open up to, and I'm the only one you trust with certain secrets. They don't know about my suicidal thoughts, or my panic disorder. They don't know about your ex who lied to you about being on the Pill and ended up getting an abortion. They don't know about the time I was molested. They don't know about your struggles with weight.

This isn't to say that I don't love you. I do, because you somehow made me trust you more in a month than I've ever trusted anybody before.

I have a health condition that no one could ever know about unless I told them and right now it isn't a crazy big deal but I have to keep monitoring it. The thing is that it causes pain that is manageable but it's still pain and I've talked to my doctor and there really is nothing I can do to get rid of that. I hate that I can't scream about it to the world because people don't understand that every day I experience this pain and it doesn't go away and it won't go away. They don't know that I am living with that. They don't know how frustrating it is to go to doctor appointments regularly as they delay the inevitable mention of the surgery I'll need down the line and potential for it to become cancerous. They don't have that constant reminder that something's not right with the way their bodies work. They can't conceive that and I can't expect them to, but I want them to know that extra stress that's added to my life. Is that selfish of me? To want that attention?

I know you haven't stopped loving me. 

I haven't. 

This was beyond puppy love. We were and ARE entirely real.  

I've tried imagining me with another person and I just can't.  I don't know if I could ever reach this level with another person.  Nobody else could so swiftly walk through all the walls and barriers that I've built to protect myself.  Nobody. 

You saw me grow, you HELPED me grow so much.  You know me better than I know myself sometimes and I know you too.  

Hold on to that love.  Please.  

Don't you realize how great we are together?  Don't you realize our hearts beat together?  Aren't you mesmerized by the feeling we have when we look into each other's eyes?  Remember when you used to whisper romantic things as I was sleeping?  Remember how like two puzzle pieces we fit perfectly on one another as I laid my head on your chest and slept for the night?  Remember I taught you how to skip rocks on the lake and you taught me to dance at my first college party?  

You do.  I do too. 

I pray for you every morning and every night because you are still the first and last person I think of.  Heck, I see you even in my dreams.  You're a part of my soul.  Losing you is losing part of me.  And I'm trying really hard to not lose myself entirely.  I'm incomplete and I don't know how to fix it. 

And yet, I cannot and will not force you to anything.  Loving you means that I must comply with what is best for you and if this is what is best for you....hopefully time becomes my best friend. 

Damn."

Sometimes I seriously hate my boobs. People generally don't believe me if I ever talk sizing (no, a 36DD will NOT fit properly). They also say stupid shit like, ""But you can only get boobs that size from surgery,"" or ""Are you sure you know what you're talking about?"" Yes, that is my actual size. No, I'm not making this up, as I have no reason to. No, trust me, them getting this big wasn't exactly voluntary. Yes, I know what I'm talking about. The fact that I wanted to have them stop bouncing painfully ALL THE TIME pretty much necessitated an ability to find a well-fitting bra. Speaking of...
Finding a bra that fits is near impossible. There essentially isn't a store closer than NYC that stocks my size. Yeah, Amazon and other online stores are pretty much my best friends in that department. It pretty much blows not being able to try anything on before I order it (thank you, Amazon, for your free return shipping). And the bigger you go, the selection drops to nothing. Seriously, stores are missing out on a big opportunity to make some money off big-boobed women's desire to have a cute bra. And speaking of money, it's far from cheap. VS is certainly overpriced (quality is shit regardless), but most of their bras are still less expensive than anything I can buy. If it's under $50, I'm ecstatic. Under $35, there's actually a happy dance involved.
Then you get to clothes. Forget finding a fitted dress. It either looks like I'm trying to escape boob prison or there's a flood of material around my waist and even my hips a little. Button down shirts? No, thanks, I don't want everyone to be playing peek-a-boo with my chest.
Finally, people stare. It's awkward as fuck. I mind this less than comments though. Seriously? Did you think I was somehow unaware of the magnitude of the sacks of tissue strapped to my chest? Lol, nope. And then what the hell is with people who think it's okay to just grab boobs? I understand how gravitational attraction works, but if you try to touch me without my consent, I will stick an elbow in your throat and break your nose.
So i guess what it all boils down to is: it's not fabulous all the time. Try to have a little empathy in that regard."

There's nothing to be afraid about hearing the word """"no.""""

I'm an average to bad looking guy - probably about a 5 now, unless I spend more time and money working out and getting better fitting clothes. I've been outright rejected (usually nicely), I've gone on dates that didn't go anywhere, I've had a few short term hookups, and I've had one long and very satisfying relationship that helped me out of bad times (and I certainly hope that I had helped her, too). The last of those only happened because she initiated it and was very clear about wanting to try something more than friends, and while we're not still together, that was the best and most intimate relationships that I've had with anyone. I only regret that we had to go our separate ways and won't be getting back together for reasons specific to our situation.

Now I've taken time for myself and I'm working on my own physical image - hell, if I don't respect myself, then who will? And now I'm fine with being single, because the person that I'm looking for doesn't have to be exceptionally beautiful or intelligent - she just has to have a personality that works well with mine and she has to have the balls to make the first move. That's the sort of confidence that I love and live for - I know that I'm not the only guy or girl that thinks like this, so if you're still reading this and you find that there's someone you can't stop thinking about, then surprise yourself and take a risk.

""Let's get something straight: a shitty day or two is no excuse to be nasty to others. You may not be able to control what happened or how you felt about it, but you can sure as hell control how you interact with others.
You'd probably call this passive aggressive, but you're not even going to figure out that it's about you, wrapped up in your own head as you are. Because everything's about you, isn't it? You're constantly trying to one-up me and put me down. And though it's only been a few weeks, I'm sick of it. You treat me terribly. You're not a friend. You're just someone I have to deal with."
4553,2014-09-08 22:06:52,"3547

I'm such an idiot when it comes to talking to girls. I tried to strike up a conversation today and it started out okay, but fell apart and became more awkward. After I said bye and left, I could hear her and her friend laughing at me. *sigh* if only there was a potion to make me more confident and suave..."

""This is for guys and girls both.

You do realize fat people are still PEOPLE?"""

I just found out rumors are spreading that I've been sleeping with this guy in my dorm. Most people in my situation would be pissed, but I'm so happy people actually think I'm having sex!"

""A bunch of freshmen just walking into a lab in Gates Hall I was studying at. One guy was like, """"these chairs are so comfortable."""" Another guy in the group said, """"we should steal a chair and go home and smoke a pipe on it...""""

My best friend from home doesn't like to be in relationships where there is any sort of attachment. He practices self sufficiency, and thinks every should too. He's loving and sweet, and was always there to listen to me when I needed him, but today he told me he can't be friends with me for a while because he's grown attached to me. Our relationship has been become codependent. It’s no longer productive. We were never dating, but I feel like he just broke up with me. He was the person I was the closest to and now I don't feel like I have many close friends at Cornell to turn to. I guess what I’m suppose to learn from this is that I don’t need to have a best friend. Ultimately I’m my own best friend."

My dad withdrew my tuition payment because I pierced my nose and now I can't figure out if it's worth it for me to leave the piercing or if I should just cave and let him win again. He is very controlling and he said I'm not welcome in my home while I have a nose ring. I want to have a good relationship with him but is doing whatever he tells me to really going to get me there?"
4559,2014-09-08 21:21:11,"3541

All the guys here keep talking about how desperate they are for sex and companionship. And as a girl starting out college, I feel the exact same. I recently entered a long distance open relationship with my boyfriend, so now not only do I have the pressures of school and making friends, I have a consistent mindset on wanting to hook up. Though my inability to find likely partners, let alone making friends in the first place, makes it even harder to pursue and makes me feel lonelier than ever."
4560,2014-09-08 21:03:13,"3540

I think I am about to get in a relationship with someone suffering form depression. I know things will be incredibly rough. It is very likely not going to work out. And I probably will end up getting very hurt. Yet I know he doesn't want it to be this way. Depression is beyond his control. He is still an amazingly smart, sweet, kind and romantic person. The good days are going to be the best days I can ever imagine, though the bad days are going to be the rock bottom of my time. I really want us to get through this. Wish me luck, people!"

""I'm tired of people disrespecting me for my major. When you disrespect what I study, it's the equivalent of you blatantly tell me that what I like and want is stupid. And it makes it hard for me to see myself ever being respected by anyone for anything. 

I'm also tired of people in my major disrespecting me for having interests outside what I study. Nobody is so boring that they only are interested in one thing. 

Okay, rant over. I'm just tired of it. This is senior year for crying out loud. If I didn't change before, there's no way in hell I'd be changing now. So stop."
4564,2014-09-08 21:40:19,"3536

An earlier confession got me thinking...I wonder if the fact that I haven't ejaculated since March has been the reason for my dramatic reduction in motivation since mid-last semester."

I think I would have left you a long time ago had I not lost my virginity to you. Sometimes, you're amazing. Sometimes, you treat me like shit. I can't tell you how many times I've cried myself to sleep. Can't you be the person I met all that time ago?"

I came to cornell 6 months ago knowing no one and found a lot of receptive people who are really helping me,I just wish airplane tickets were not so expensive so I could go back home and hug my mom"
4569,2014-09-08 01:12:27,"3531
I watch Pokemon porn. And I'm in a frat. I'm scared if they ever find out I watch this shit, they'd all take turns beating the shit out of me. But idk how much longer I could keep this secret. When I masturbate now, I usually load the videos on my laptop and go for a quickie in the woods. Idk man...I'm so effed up in the head. Are there any sex clinics in the area that treat this sort of addiction? Or should I just embrace it and hope my future wife will be into dressing up like a Jigglypuff in bed?"
4570,2014-09-08 01:28:29,"3530
Walking through Clubfest I saw so many organizations solely for women or specific races or nationalities. Its the same thing with scholarships. Isn't there anything out there specifically for white males?"

The other night I had a dream about my roommates. Everything started out normal until all three of us walked into the bathroom, grabbed toothbrushes and started masturbating in our really really small bath tub. The worst part is, I think this is the first time I ever came while dreaming. I don't know what to do. Every time I see a toothbrush I can't help but get aroused. And I don't even know how to act around my roommates anymore. HALP!"
4573,2014-09-08 01:08:36,"3527
So I just transferred to cornell and I fucking love it. But not having that one place where I can just chill and decompress alone is annoying not to have.. So I resorted to sometimes sitting on the steps next to the law school at like pretty late hours to just be alone and try to decipher my thoughts, you get me? But if you guys have any suggestions for a place like that than please let me know, if not I guess the steps next to the law school is my new ""spot"" lol"
4574,2014-09-08 01:42:38,"3526
I think I am addicted to girls with green eyes. I find something so rare, exotic and entrancing about them. They aren't the common brown nor innocent blue but scream the perfect combination of allure, sexiness and brains. It's really too bad how uncommon they are :("

4577,2014-09-06 20:14:41,"3523

I am so incredibly into you. It was like I fell for your brain and all its thoughts first and then I noticed that you were also extremely handsome. All my life the order of falling for someone has been the other way around... and thus no one's brain has come close to how awesome I think yours might be."

Guys who masturbate 1+ times a day - first of all, you need to bring that rate way down to at most twice a week or the constant stream of dopamine will seriously disrupt your normal brain function. Second, make sure to switch hands. Especially if you've done it so much that you've developed a tolerance and now need highly increased pressure to get off (which by the way, let me tell you, no real vagina will provide). At that point it becomes an intensive upper body compound exercise that you perform twice a day or more. What ends up being affected is your forearm, bicep, tricep, delt, chest, lat and the corresponding half of your trap muscle. You are gonna get so asymmetrical you won't be able to work out with barbells anymore and will need to use dumbbells for additional reps on your non-jerking half just to balance it out. Excessive masturbation affects your entire body negatively, including your brain. Do it once a week just so you don't lose your mind, and guess what - that will also give you the motivation to go out and talk to girls, of which there are plenty of gorgeous ones on this campus. And you'll become a better, more balanced person overall. All of the above is obviously speaking from experience."

 There seems to be a myth that a guy should make the first move; to delegate that job to men; is to relegate women as submissive and non - dominate .... Just saying!"

I don't mean to be one of those guys, but you seem to like me, and I like you, so just make a move already! What in the world is taking you so long? I'm too shy and courteous to do so myself."

My old friends find it funny when I physically stumble and trip at the oddest of places. I laugh it off too but secretly it makes me want to cry. It wasn't like this last year. But this time, I feel utterly lost. I was the one picking anyone up, no matter how heavy they (or their burden was) were. And now I can't even walk straight."
4583,2014-09-06 19:29:52,"3517

Thank you to the person who emailed me after I lost my wallet. I am so grateful that you found it and bothered to help me, and you'll never actually know how much it meant to me. This week I lost my aunt to ALS and my grandmother had another stroke. I'm a transfer student so it's only my second week here, but I can honestly say that you have restored my faith in humanity. Go Big Red!"

I am tired of feeling this way. I'm tired of feeling insignificant compared to other guys. I'm tired of losing friends, or having my texts ignored, of feeling like a complete social failure. I've been on my own for quite a while now and I have a feeling that it's not going to change. I just don't know what to do. I'm not asking to get laid or anything like that, I just want to be sociable, funny, interesting. Honestly, if it weren't for my family members and the grief, shame, and trauma it would cause them (on top of bills from my loans), I think I would have offed myself a long time ago. I hope things get better."

I was studying at Uris when behind me, I started to hear some loud and random mutterings. So looking behind me, I saw an interesting old fellow muttering and complaining to the computer screen he was sitting in front of. ""There goes $12,000!"" and ""What is this thing in front of me! I want to see product, that's $5,000!"" and ""Carrots!"" (or what I made out to be carrots). As his muttering continued, the thought that he must be a secretly rich accounting genius ran through my mind. Yet the alarming thing was that a part of me felt, can this weird person get out of my library, and another realized just how trained I had become at Cornell to expect to always see people, who thought and acted the way I did."

I actually just overheard someone talking about how annoying it is that her mom calls her every week. Personally, I have two parents who I adore and who love me, but if you're talking that loudly, you don't know who might overhear you. Next time it might be someone who lost their parent tragically. Just think before you say some things."

I began applying for jobs one year ago during the fall of my senior year and since then have landed absolutely nothing. I graduated in May with a very marketable major, my grades are decent, I've had several internships throughout college, and all of my friends from my major are either employed or in graduate school right now...but none of that seems to matter when it comes to me getting employed. I came to Cornell for a prosperous career, and I'm really starting to think that it was a waste."

I hate how every year the same patterns occur with new summer friends. Every summer whenever I'm in a program, internship, etc (both Cornell & non-Cornell) it feels like everyone becomes close to each  other. We all feel (or at least act) like the best of friends and that we'll all stay friends for a long time & I keep fooling myself into thinking that'll last after the summer. But every time the minute the summer's over and we're all back on campus it's like nothing ever happened. People I felt close to during the summer now act like they never met me before & the new-friends I thought I made are now seemingly gone. Just once I wish I can make a friend in the summer that's willing to stay connected longer than a summer program keeps us together. I'm tired of having short-term/temporary friends that only last a few weeks to a few months."

""I think I saved a girl from getting raped a couple of weeks ago.  I was sitting in my house, and there was a party going on next door.  I then heard a girl literally screaming for help. Like really screaming.  No exaggeration.

I ran outside as quick as I could, and I'm pretty sure I scared the guy away, or at least stopped him, cause as soon as I was outside, she stopped screaming and ran off. It was pretty dark outside, so I couldn't see if he stopped because he saw me running at him (and I couldn't see his face), but the guy was trying to brush it off like it was nothing.  It took everything in my power not to beat him right then and there.

I went over to the girl, who by now was with two of her friends, and being consoled and made sure she was ok. She was, but she was more worried that she had woken me or the other people in my house up. I should have stayed with her just a bit longer, just to make sure she was ok, and to let her know that she didn't wake me up. But as long as she was ok, and wasn't raped, I can sleep at night.  Who knows what would've happened if I didn't do anything and she was raped. I would not be able to sleep at night, I know that.

If that girl happens to be reading this, I'm glad you're ok and you didn't wake me up :)

And to the rest of you, keep your ears and eyes open.  You never know what could happen around you, and maybe you can save a girl from being raped."""

""Last year I was depressed as hell. I felt like my circle of friends was eroding away as they went towards for fun and interesting people and I was still trying to get over some confidence problems from high school. On top of that, my family situation at home was deteriorating with sick family members and an uncertain financial future as the bills piled up. As I sunk to my lowest point, I somehow ignited a fire within myself. As much as I wanted to give up, accept personal and financial defeat, I knew that I couldn't. Failure was not an option. I don't know exactly how I'm going to muddle through everything that has been flung at me, but I do know this: whatever chasms appear on my path, I will leap over them. Whatever obstacles come my way, I will shatter them. I am not going to sit idly by and let the world try and tear me down. I may not have as many assets, or connections, or wealth as other here, but I won't let that deter me. I am going to regain my confidence; I am going to earn a killer GPA; I am going to become more involved on campus; I will work until I have nothing left give; I will reign in a new and true circle of friends; I will emerge victorious and successful and restore my family to financial security. I may not get there tomorrow, or next week, but I can see my path, and I know what I must due. I cannot fail. I REFUSE!!!!"

I have a huge problem. My girlfriend of 3 months had decided to get intimate with me just a few days back. The problem lies in the physical size disparity. She is MUCH shorter than me (her head only reaches to about my chest level). So the other day we were making love and I could tell she was faking it. SHE WAS TOTALLY FAKING IT. I know because the sounds she was making was of someone in pain, not those of someone experiencing sweet pleasure. Shortly after the nasty deed was done, she made up some excuse and hurriedly scurried out the door half-limping and half sprinting with a very noticeable thigh gap. I feel horrible. I honestly think she's going to break up with me because my dick is too big. We haven't talked to each other since.."

I hate the initial small talk from meeting people, which is a reason why this week has been so hard on me in terms of making friends and whatnot.
I want to know what makes people tick, that random boner that they got on their first day of co-ed gym class, weird shit about them from when they were 5, their innermost dreams, hopes & worst nightmares, and to have silence without it being awkward!!!... 
It's like my brain skips over that shit or something... I am also a one-on-one person so anything greater than one person at a time makes me almost silent in conversation"
4638,2014-09-04 09:10:43,"3462
It is so fucking hard for me to get the courage to talk to people. I think that I am so worthless and pathetic that I do not deserve to have any fun or friends. I've constantly heard that we have to talk to people and be well-known to have both connections and friends, but it is so hard to say ""hey"" to people, let alone be this person that people enjoy being around. I've really been trying though, but I get too scared to approach people. Every time that I do, I end up either babbling/stuttering like an idiot, or sounding extremely boring (because I'm too afraid to let out my weirdness)... I I don't want to bother people or force them to be around me or make them hate me... UGH... I think I'm being an attention seeker right now, but meh... Sorry... just meh. I'm sorry to everyone I've forced myself upon & I'm sorry for everyone who wasted their time reading my shitty ramblings."

""How not to fail in a dining hall:
1. Don't set things on fire. This includes but is not limited to toasters, waffle irons, microwaves, and ice cream.
2. Don't steal things.
3. Don't be a dick when confronted about stealing things.
4. Don't be a dick generally.
5. Don't leave your cups and mugs everywhere. It's not supposed to be a screwed up Easter egg hunt for the workers.
6. Do take your stuff to the dish return.
7. Don't make out. The bread rack is not a proper place for PDA. Or the salad bar. Or the tables. Or anything even remotely horizontal.
8. Do ask if you need to know about allergens.
9. Do USE THE FUCKING TONGS.
10. Do tell a worker if you dump a plate on the floor. Or generally make a mess. The longer it sits, the bigger a pain in the ass it'll be.
11. Don't duck under the sneeze guards. They're called sneeze guards for a reason.
12. Do tell a worker if you see problems in the dining hall (soda is flat, milk isn't dispensing, melted ice cream mess, etc.)
13. Don't muck about with the soft serve machine. And put the handles back up when you're done.
14. Do sit with people you don't know. Great place to meet friends.
15. Do say please and thank you.
16. Do respect the tilted chair.
17. Do try new foods and eat your veggies.
18. Don't be a dick. It bears repeating.

Welcome to Cornell, class of 2018. Please don't burn my dining hall down."

But then I go back to missing you.  I just have to throw myself into life and find other ways to make myself, I guess.  My friends don't understand.

So I've been waiting for a whole week to pass before saying this.  I'm a freshman and I don't really have any friends.  Everyone seems so close already, and I meet new people, but nobody that I'm actually friends with.  I get that it's still the beginning of the semester, and that some clubs haven't even started yet, but is it going to get better?  I'm not an unfriendly person, I introduce myself to people next to me in lectures but after that hour is over, I don't see them again.  It's just frustrating because I'm putting in an effort but it isn't helping.  For instance, after one class, I walked back to North campus with some people I had just met, but the entire time, they only talked to each other.  I tried starting a conversation but it always ended up being the two of them.  I love Cornell already but things would be so much better if I had some real friends..."

She sends me the occasional facebook message or snapchat, but those are all. She's living with her friends and I'm living with mine. Should I let go?

I don't expect everyone in Cornell being motivated and ambitious to be some kind of leader, but I'm still super disappointed. Is this where I go to school? Anything wrong with the school or me myself? Does this show the ""selective""  or ""rigorous"" admission process is completely a joke? Why are there immature people who don't understand basic respect and politeness to others that they even don't know? I don't care whether they are drunk because no matter what, this is not acceptable. I have to reposition what Cornell should be like in my mind, since maybe it's actually just not as good as I thought. I hope to graduate from this place as soon as possible."

I used to be a lonely skinny nerd. Then I started working out 2 hours a day and following a strict diet. I've put on 35 pounds in 2 years and I feel like Superman. I am still a lonely friendless virgin and will most likely die one. But it's an amazing feeling to swing all of this lean mass around and have people look at you as if you're someone. People are so primal it's amazing, I never thought muscles would make such a tremendous difference in the way I was perceived. I am still weird as heck and will never have a social life. But the confidence that comes with having a great body mitigates some of the sadness that is seeing happy young people laughing together and having a good time and knowing you can never be like them. I recommend working out for depression, you'll see progress and you'll feel amazing. Maybe one day I'll beat one of the frat boys senseless for fun. Strength is the great equalizer."

This is a serious question that has been confusing me for a while, and I do need an answer. Why are there people being insulting on or near campus, sometimes shouting dirty words to random people walking by? I do not care whether they are drunk because no matter what, this is of no good. Is it because Cornell is not selective enough so that immature people who don't understand respect and politeness get in? Admission process doesn't care about this at all? School admin doesn't see scenes like this? What are these insulting kids doing and thinking about? This literally ruins my college experience, and I never truly enjoy any weekend nights because I'm afraid of running into people behaving this way."

They had already established their group of hallmates and started making connections out at parties before move-in day was done. Everything here is just way more fast-paced socially than I'm used too or capable of keeping up with. I'm pretty confident that I'll catch up eventually, but for now, it just seems like I'm trailing behind everyone and desperately trying to catch up."

4735,2014-08-22 13:04:54,"3365

They say ""It is better to have loved and lost than to never have loved it all"".  I can't imagine that those people have ever loved before.  This expression can't possibly sum up how it feels to have lost the person who made you feel strong when you were weak, who saw nothing but the best in you, who was your crying shoulder.  It fails to understand what it means to be stunned again and again by the beauty of a woman, to work your ass off fighting for a relationship because even the best ones are hard, to not have to worry about the future the present is just that good."

I feel called to spend my life with a woman of God, to get married and start a family.  Right now that's my biggest concern, though I do want a job to support that goal.  Experience tells me she'll be loving and very caring, but also passionate in and out of the bedroom (even before marriage).  If she were to read this right now, I'd tell her that I'm looking and praying for her, and someday, I've got a lot of love to give her."

4740,2014-08-22 13:49:13,"3360

After waiting 18 years and surviving my first year of college, I got a boyfriend. He is the Shaggy to my Velma. The bong to my pipe. The food to my munchies. Although this is my first relationship, I'm taking a huge leap by having long distance relationship. My mom thinks I shouldn't be tied down, because she thinks sophomore year I'll find someone else. It worries me a lot....I really like my boyfriend :("

Yesterday I was on tinder and this girl told me that her biggest fantasy was for me to stick my toe in her vagina while we were in a public jacuzzi.  So in response, I was like """"that sounds good, wanna have sex?"""" And after that she blocked me.

I tell people that I don't want to get married and I never want to have children, and people just laugh and say that I will anyway. But I don’t think they understand the severity of the issue. Now fresh out of Cornell, it feels that whatever emotional life I had was destroyed and that all I have left are objectives, targets that need to be hit. It’s as if I was made into something worse, where goals and objectives surpass emotion and freedom. How can I find someone to have the patience and heart to deal with me and how can I somehow express the feelings that may be difficult to feel? Nonetheless, how on Earth could I bring a child onto this planet when I’m just as imperfect and flawed?

It keeps me from getting too close to people, whether they're friends or boyfriends.  That part of me does terrible things to scare them away because I don't want them to hurt me...and then I really hurt myself in the process because I lose people who are important to me. They don't realize how much it hurts. And I hate myself more than they ever could.  And that pain and self-loathing is really hard for me to shoulder because I'm weak. So fucking weak."

I was diagnosed with leukemia in April and have been in chemo every week since. I have only told a few people, and it now looks like I'll need to take leave from Cornell this year, missing my senior year. 

I'm very afraid and upset. I've bottled up my emotions and tried to avoid thinking about the high likelihood that this is it for me, and now I'm realizing that I'm probably going to leave this world as a skinny, pale, bald little boy. I won't be able to graduate college or even use my education in the world. My parents, who consigned my loans, will be on the hook for all of my debt.

This is just so fucked up. I keep thinking that this can't be real, like it's a movie or something. I don't know why I'm confessing this here, it's kind of a lame attempt to get strangers to care about me for a few seconds."

To #3346: My ex was just like that. He could be very sweet and loving when he wanted, but he rarely decided to do it. And I loved him more than anything, but I broke up with him. And it is one of the best decisions I've ever made. You deserve someone who loves you all the time. I don't know if you've heard of her, but there's an author I love - Rainbow Rowell. I read her first book, Attachments, and there was this quote that struck me:

""'I didn't know love could leave the lights on all the time. I thought it took more naps. Or blinked. I didn't know it could just go on and on and like this without falling off an edge. Like pi. Lincoln... Lincoln, are you asleep? I didn't know someone could love me like this,' she said. 'Could love me and love me and love without... needing space.'

Lincoln wasn't asleep. He rolled on top of her. 'There's no air in space.'

It's like I am in a TV show; as if I am not real. Everything is fake. I am fake. I started drinking; a lot. Get drunk every other day. I started smoking cigarettes. I don't really care if it is killing me. I am not afraid to die - don't care if I die tomorrow in some car accident, hit by a drunk driver - but it is not something I seek either.

""I'm really excited to go back to Cornell, but also apprehensive. How will I reenter the fold? I am reminded of a few lines from """"The Blind Assassin,"""" by Margaret Atwood. 

""""Farewells can be shattering, but returns are surely worse. Solid flesh can never live up to the bright shadow cast by its absence. Time and distance blur the edges; then suddenly the beloved has arrived, and it’s noon with its merciless light, and every spot and pore and wrinkle and bristle stands clear."

I can't even give the slightest suggestion that I dated one of my really close guy friends, or have kissed or been somewhat intimate with someone, or more than one person. I can't share these details without being looked at as corrupted or dirty in my """"religious"""" household, I mean, my parent's mind..as if they were the end all, be all of righteousness. 

So what if I lived while I was away? So what if I've formed my own opinions? So what if I've once and for all decided that no one else should have control over my actions because they are my own?
I had begun to mold myself while I was away. I began to own up to my true identity. Then I came home and felt so oppressed. 

I am not guilty of anything that is really wrong.
I don't want to let my whole life pass me by and then regret not following my own impulses. 
I just want to be free, mistakes or no mistakes.

""After thinking really long and really hard this whole summer, I've finally come to the decision that I will not be having children.

Maybe it seems weird that I've already decided that when I'm only in college and have a good few years before I finally have to start thinking about having a family, but this is necessary for me to feel sure and happy about my own future.

I used to get so anxious when I thought about life after college; I'd hopefully attend my preferred graduate school, move to an area with many opportunities in my desired field, enjoy life for a few years, and then... have a family? That was the part that panicked me. My 30's and 40's were suddenly not going to be my own to live, and I had only so much time to do what I wanted and 20 years were going to be given to someone else.

I want the time to go to the places I want to go and to pursue the interests I never had a chance to pursue because I had spent so much time focused on school. I want to live where I actually want to live and have the house that I've always imagined for myself. If I couldn't do this on my own I'd be fine with that; I'd know I wasn't doing enough. I'd be filled with so much regret if I knew I couldn't because I had to chosen to have children.

It didn't even occur to me until this summer that I could just... Not have any kids. Did someone tell me I had to? Is there some rule that everyone has to go through the motion of raising of a family? That you won't be fulfilled by not adhering to this social norm? No, there's not.

You can call me selfish, that I'll never understand true love until I have kids, that hormones will kick in and I'll change my mind. You know, maybe I will change my mind and I'll find someone that I want to raise a family with. But I am not selfish for choosing myself over a being that does not even exist in this world yet. I have the agency to make my own, rational decisions regardless of what my hormones tell me to do. Can't I argue that you're the selfish one for trying to make someone else live the life you want to live?

I still have a lot of research to do about long term birth control and even possibly surgery, but already knowing that this is the course I want to take with my life is finally, for ONCE, making me excited about my future."""

""I want you to love me all the time, or not at all.

Flaws in the way things are done in my country became very obvious and some things in the way some of my friends treat me started to bother me whereas I didn't even notice those things before.
I also became very attached to the people I met abroad and now that everyone is so far away I've lost contact with some of them and started to question if they even considered me as their friend.
I thought it was just the shock of coming back and it would go away after a while.

""In the light of Robin Williams' death, I'd like to share my views on suicide here - if it's not an appropriate outlet feel free not to post it admins, I'll completely understand.

It's good that this is anonymous, because in real life I'd be weary of sharing this as there is a stigma associated with holding any views on suicide other than the default """"it's a horrible tragedy"""" one. But it's how I feel, maybe some of you will agree.

I find it incredibly hypocritical for people to readily judge the most important decision in a person's life, a decision that is usually informed to a very high degree by factors no one but that person is privy to. I think we should respect a person's decision to commit suicide instead of immediately jumping to the conclusion it was a result of mental illness, insanity, etc.

The reason I find it so offensive is because this is the ONE thing you have true control over in life. The one thing no one can take away from you regardless of what political regime you live under, what other circumstances are at play, the one freedom that doesn't extend to someone else's. And what you're essentially doing when you voice your opinion that it was a tragedy fueled by insanity or mental illness (even if you don't call it that) is take away that last vestige of control someone had over their life, which is their last vestige of dignity.

No one chose to be alive and experiencing reality is the most subjective thing ever, so for you to say - how could we have prevented this tragedy is to me offensive to human intelligence. Suicide is not some insane decision, it's usually the result of long and careful deliberation - everyone has a strong self-preservation instinct that has deep evolutionary roots. Rarely is it done on a whim. It's incredibly hard to do as you all know -- no matter how incredibly depressed or suicidal you are, you very quickly dissuade yourself from actually going through with it it. When the decision is made in a healthy brain, it's the result of existence having reached an unbearable state.

I'm not saying celebrate the fact the person finally got out either. I'm just saying celebrate their life and respect their decision to end it. Maybe it's because I'm not burdening my reasoning with religious nonsense, which treats human life non-logically, but from a scientific perspective you are in no position to judge someone's brain. Sometimes suicide IS the result of mental illness (which includes the vast majority instances when it's done impulsively) when the person has a damaged brain. That was not the case with Robin Williams. It was a conscious decision that was made when he considered all the information and I respect it. And it doesn't prevent me from celebrating his life and contributions nor does it prevent me from missing him and feeling sad.

Some people are just miserable their entire lives regardless of social life, success, money, relationships etc. Especially intelligent people as they are capable of a wider range of experiences. At some point suffering becomes too much, especially when it's augmented by aging. How incredibly selfish of you to say that just because YOU will miss them or because YOU wouldn't make the same decision because YOUR life plays out differently in your head and YOU're happy for purely neurological reasons, because their death affects YOU negatively, then everyone should reason the same way as you and act in accordance with your well-being. Why don't you mind your own business and let people make their own decisions."""

People at Cornell are too willing to fuck with other people and their feelings. You would think a group of kids as smart as this would not burn bridges so easily. Guys that call girls disgusting, degrading names, girls that stab each other and ruin each other's reputations behind each others' backs... you should be ashamed of yourself. But besides that, these are going to be some powerful people in the world and you never know when your paths should cross again. For example, I'm going into HR and I can damn well tell you that if some people's resumes came through... they would meet the office shredder!"

I clean up really well afterward, it's actually probably more sanitary than peeing in the bowl where sprinkles will go flying everywhere. I only do it in my own sink, let me make that clear.

I hate that she's the one who has to give dating advice to me, even though I'm older and partially done with college. Some times I feel this personally, like something must be wrong with me, but other times I just feel like I've failed as an older sister by not being able to give her advice about this sort of thing.

I used to love my sorority, but the way the older girls talk down to us is getting kind of ridiculous. I am your equal, not your inferior. Stop treating me as though I only serve to exist to make the house look good and recruit new pledges. Regardless of what you think, wearing my hair in a bun and not looking perfect when I wear my letters does not reflect as poorly on the house as youd think. I'm not sure why most of the older girls in my house act as though being a year older gives them some ominous power over me and the right to tell me what to do. I joined to form bonds and friendships, not to be told what to do by girls who have been put in, and enjoy flaunting their arbitrary positions of power. This is a sorority, not military school. I have had an extremely busy summer, and will have an even busier sophomore year. I find it kind of insane that I'm expected to, and even forced to participate in events to avoid fines. Time to deactivate.

My friends in other houses feel the same way. As a message to all rising juniors and seniors in sororities, please take some time to realize that we joined sororities to have fun and make friends, and while we are willing to do some work to make that happen, being nice to us and not threatening us with various fines will go a lot farther in cementing bonds."

Sometimes we make mistakes that are irreversible. We have the right to cry and be upset. But most of all, we have the right to forgive ourselves. 

The world won't stop as it seems it should. The people you hurt will remain wounded until you help heal them. And the money you lost will eventually be replaced if you can pull yourself together and keep your head up high. 

We humans make mistakes. At that moment, it is difficult to comprehend what else to do but hate yourself.

 But no matter how horrible it seems, we should see that there are two choices: we can be self-destructive and hateful ... Or we can learn to forgive ourselves and make something beautiful out of life.

Nothing is ever the end unless you yourself decide it to be."

In response to #3257:

I just came out to all of my friends this year, but I'm nonetheless facing a similar problem of going back into the closet for next year. I'm seriously considering rushing, and I'm kind of nervous that frats will see my sexuality and won't even try to get to know more about me as a person.

I've also definitely had my share of using alcohol as an escape, and I was pretty much a functional alcoholic for most of this year.

THAT being said, you need to learn how to love yourself for who you are. Confronting everything that you've been repressing for so long is always uncomfortable and emotional, but the benefits of being able to live openly and freely far outweighs the difficulty of being honest with yourself. And remember, sexuality doesn't define all of who you are. That person who you've spent all of your life becoming is still authentic; you're just unveiling a new additional part of yourself that you had previously kept hidden."

@#3241:

I once faced a similar problem when I was interning at a hospital. Every time she saw me, she gave me dirty looks and made snide comments when I past her but not about the other interns of the same race as her even though they didn't work as hard as I did. What worked was reporting the issue to my supervisor who later addressed her about her behavior. Though I received more angry looks after that, the important part is getting them to realize that those sort of actions are not tolerated. Next time it could be a patient and not you."

Several Cornell employees harbor resentment towards us students and I just don't understand it. They think of us all as spoiled trust fund babies who've never known a day of hardship and don't value hardwork. While that maybe true of some students at Cornell, the vast majority of us worked hard for years and earned a place at this university. There are kids whose presence here would be impossible without scholarships that they also worked hard for. My parents can comfortably afford an Ivy League education, but that doesn't mean my life hasn't been difficult too. I struggled through years of abuse and depression, but somehow I got here. I heard a Cornell employee mocking another student, asking him how it felt to waste $30,000 in six months. Well, I wouldn't know. I don't really consider an investment in my future a waste."

I'm glad to be done with that (It was for the best) but now I'm worried I won't have the time/social circle to do all the fun things that Cornell has to offer. Ironically, I'm in a sorority that I USED to love but now I've come to realize that a good amount of the sisters are real bitches. Nonetheless, I hope I can find those few good sisters/friends outside of my sorority that I can really bond with and have a great last year at Cornell.

Have you ever realized after talking to someone for hours and hours that the whole time they've talked about themselves without ever a thought for you?

Sometimes I get so tired of constantly assuring people that things will be okay for them. 
Just ask me how I'm doing once in a while because you never know if I'll just break down and tell you what's really on my mind. 

Usually I don't feel like talking but once in a while just ask me how I'm doing. Even that small gesture is really appreciated."

Yesterday I was just thinking about how grateful and lucky I am to have such an amazing friend like her but this morning for some reason I became super annoyed by her being.

There are honestly so many people I would love to unfriend/unfollow on social media but I can't because nowadays people take that shit so seriously. Just because I unfollowed you on instagram doesn't mean that our friendship is over or that I despise your existence, it just means you post stupid ass shit that I don't want to see every two hours. We don't need to see the selfie you took while mowing the lawn. We also don't need to see the haircut selfie thats just an obvious attempt to show your tits. We also don't need to see the pic of you holding your Starbucks cup over your steering wheel in a desperate attempt to show off to everyone about your CLA250 that you're leasing. It's just sad."

I am choosing to skip my old best friend's wedding today.  I feel like a horrible person, I truly do.  This will be the first time that I have ever done something this selfish before.  I know it is the wrong thing to do, but after everything he put me through over the years and the current status of our friendship I just can't muster up the strength to go.  Things just aren't the same anymore, they haven't been for a long time now.  I know he feels bad about everything that went on between us, and that he regrets it and wants to make everything up to me, but we haven't seen each other in over a year now and besides words I have not seen him trying.  I don't think hanging out for the first time should be on his wedding day to a girl he has been dating less than a year that I know nothing about.   I hope I don't come to regret this someday, but I know this is my choice and I will live with the consequences.  I guess this confession is me finally saying that I don't feel I owe him anything anymore and if we wants me to be his friend again he will have to work for it. If not, then maybe our paths will cross again another time in life....Time to stop living in the past and figure out my future.  I can't wait to get back to Cornell and start senior year off right."

I just want to let you know, I'm coming for you come August. I haven't been able to stop thinking about you and the last time we were together. It sucks that we finally acted on our feelings at the end of the semester when we'd be so far apart for the summer, but that's all moot now. Another month and I can finally see what happens, because I do feel like you get it, that's there's this mutual connection, that I don't have to strive to keep up a facade. And maybe, nothing will happen. Maybe I shouldn't get my hopes or expectations up. But on the other hand, I've spent the summer learning to love myself and conquering my fears and at least now I know that I'm worth the love and respect I've been pushing away."

Honestly, freshman year was extremely hard for me.  My boyfriend went to college down the road from Cornell, and I was with him most of the time.  I didn't make very many friends because I didn't go to parties and I didn't join a sorority.  It is hard to find friends who didn't join a sorority.  I made a lot of friends, but I never spent any time out of class or work with them.  I rarely ate dinner with anyone.  I also battled with depression because my boyfriend totaled his car and I was the passenger.  It was scary and I didn't have anyone to lean on except for him, but he was depressed as well.  So I had no one to pull me out.  I ended up pulling myself out of it, and now I've lost 20lbs and I'm feeling stronger than ever.  Going into my sophomore year I'm going to be more open and actually look for more friends.  I have never felt more strong or grown up in my life.  Its empowering and it is an absolute great feeling.  So for those having a rough time with your life, find a friend, or rely on yourself.  Everything gets better even if you don't think so at the time."

I'm concerned for humanity. So much violence. So much hate. I can understand how conflicts arrise; siblings, spouses, and friends, let alone Jews and Palestinians, can't avoid it. But in no instance is the taking of a life justified! Both sides must use words and only words. But before that can happen, both sides must recognize that Jews and Palestinians are all equally human; members of both sides are equally capable of love and compassion. Jews love and protect their friends and family the same way Palestinians do. Losing one will cause the same amount of pain no matter which side they're on. One is not less entitled to life than the other. Let's see some peace talks."

5019,2014-07-28 13:34:27,"3183
If I have any advice for incoming freshmen, its that when you're getting to know people and trying to make friends, don't settle for anyone just because you're scared of being alone. Freshman year is hard, you might battle depression, you might party too hard, and you'll definitely need a shoulder to cry on. Take your time, get to know people, and make sure that the people you choose to be your friends are people you can count on when life gets hard. Don't settle, because when life get tough, those friends will be the ones who stay by your side. No one knows anyone during Orientation, you won't be left behind and sometimes fast friends will leave just as quickly."

Before I came to Cornell, I viewed a university - perhaps higher education - as a respite. I was driven by passion for knowledge. In high school, I greatly enjoyed Socratic seminars; to me, sharing ideas with others, and having others share their own, is grandiose. I fondly think of those days where we passionately debated existentialism, The Death of a Salesman, and other works in AP Literature. I yearned for similar experiences in college.

Yet, Cornell does not nurture this culture. There is no honest drive for knowledge, for enjoyment and refinement of abstraction for its own sake. What was the last time you discussed Nietzsche, Sartre, Kierkegaard, Freud with your friends at a social gathering? I am betting that 80% of people that are reading this line at the moment are laughing at the utter 'absurdity' of such a statement - that is if they even have any vague notion of who those men are. No shock the American education system has not produced anyone even slightly reminiscent of these great European minds - and how could it? After all, we are driven by a pursuit of money, cheap sex, Keystone, more liquor. Ask anybody what their goal after college is - I dare you. I am almost positive that 90% of the time it will be something along the lines of ""getting out and making tons of money"". How noble!

This lack of culture is absurd. Pervasive and detrimental it manifests itself in the feeling of hollowness abundant on campus. But we are cowards - we don't want to admit it and face it - so we pick a delusion over reality, drowning in pools of liquor (Lamar anyone?), weed every night. But it's all just a part of college experience, isn't it? Sure, to each his own. I am just tired of it all. Tired of meaninglessness. Tired of people that somehow got ""dumbed down"" upon coming here. Tired of living this silly little life surrounded by people who don't want to hear it, don't understand, and, I am afraid, cannot understand."

Depression has lived in me since I was 11. That year, I was bullied by my classmates as well as my teachers. I still don't know if my parents know anything about that, because I never said anything, and I never trusted them. They fought all the time, and I fought with my dad all the time. 
The same year, my grandpa passed away. Even though I didn't tell him anything related to what happened at school, when he sensed that something was not right, he always stood up for me. I felt I died once when he passed away.
However, the most difficult thing was to pretend that I was fine, to lift up to the expectation other people put on me, and to be all strong and happy. I know, it's stupid of me, but I didn't know better.
So, what happen afterwards? Life goes on. I tried to open up, but everyone has difficulties in life, and why would anyone care about how I feel? So, I just kept studying and got into Cornell. I guess depression is something I have to live with."

Reading these confessions just reinforces my love for Cornell -- our school consists of genuine people, who come from different backgrounds, who appreciate the amazing opportunity of premium class education, who know how to feel both love and hatred and happiness and sadness, and who accept their sexuality. I struggled academically this past semester, but reading these confessions helped me get over myself and realize that I'm not the only one in this boat. Even after the academic struggle last year, I can't wait to go back to Cornell after this godforsakenly long summer vacation, and I have the admins to partially thank for my love and pride for Cornell."

I realized this past semester that I've got seasonal affective disorder. And while I am working on that, my withdrawal into depression resulted in me letting someone down. Majorly. And so I've been carrying around this tremendous amount of guilt for the past, what, five months. I finally really apologized and explained why what happened happened.

""This past year I've become such a cold person. I started only seeing the bad in people, Ive made hateful comments and acted like I was somehow """"above"""" others. I've literally responded to simple hellos from other people with """"please stop talking"""". My friends even laughed along and that made me feel like it was alright.

The past year i've been more depressed than I ever have been and by acting like a total asshole, I was able to actually hide that fact from myself because it let me think I was better. I've had many many successes this year but I've had no one to share them with and that has made me sad.

I have begun to remember where I came from, and I have learned that success means thave nothing can be below you. If you are CEO of a major firm, you should still be picking up garbage in the lobby when you see it. I have begun to love others again. I have begun to love myself again, and not in a cocky way. I have begun to remember who I was before all of this stress, insecurity and the thirst to """"be the best at all costs"""" set in.

Im sorry this is so long, but i'd just like to apologize for all the hate. I guess if this were mean girls i'd be the one who is overly emotional and said they """"just had alot of feelings"""". 

All I can do now is just start the love back up. I love you Cornell."""

I wasn't any teacher's favorite student in high school. I was a quite guy and barely spoke. One other student, X, was almost all of my teachers favorite. We both applied to Cornell and I got in and he did not. He got into NYU and all my teachers were happy and proud of him, and nobody recognized my achievement, not even our college counselor. Even though I got into two ivies and X got into none, he got recognized in the graduation for his accomplishments and they did not even have a word for me. Only my mom was proud of me even though she had no idea about Cornell or about American education system in general. Today, after 2 years when Cornell came up as #11 university in the world, I was proud of myself and my university. I was so excited that I messaged few of my friends about it and they behaved like it is not a not a big deal or whatsoever (they don't even go to a top ranked school at all). I was hurt again, and it made me feel like shit. I feel like my achievements are always gonna go in vain like this and I feel like I will never hear somebody congratulating me for my accomplishments. Now you may say that dude, you are overly sensitive, maybe yeah I am a bit sensitive, but sometimes we all need that support to move forward, I know I have my mom who is happy for me and proud of me, but I need some friend(s) who will also recognize me and help me move forward.

She's going to be able to teach me about all the things she knows and cares about, but she's also going to listen to me when I ramble on about the trivial things I care about. She's going to push me when I'm losing motivation, and she's going to come to me when she's struggling to stay motivated herself. She's going to live, laugh and use Oxford commas sometimes.

You were happy to talk to me when you had no one else to talk to, but once you got a life I was no longer needed. That's a pretty low blow if you ask me. 

I recognize what I did wrong and am sorry for it. I have said sorry so many times. I've been nice, I've been harsh, I've said it every way I could think of. I don't know what you want from me anymore.

You certainly had the time to write those messages about how horrible you think I am, but apparently you don't have time to even discuss how we can move forward. You claim to be so mature, and yet you don't even know how to say sorry.

Lonely, my friends all busy..
Forgotten, because I'm 95% of the time the one who has to send the first text, or make the call...
I don't get it. I'm friendly, I'm not bad looking, in decent shape...
What is it?

There is so much in my mind that I'd love to illustrate to those that may care about interacting with me...

Too optimistic? Too religious? Too set in my ways?
I thought coming to college was not about losing yourself...but upholding that identity that makes you so you....

At one point in my life, I really hated being an Asian male. Growing up in a mostly caucasian neighborhood, when people met me for the first time they would always have all these preconceived notions about my personality, my interests, and my identity. I always felt like before I was evaluated as an individual, I had to do everything I could to tear down these stereotypes and prove that I wasn't ""just another Asian."" I mean I didn't really blame them. The way Asian men are portrayed in Hollywood, as these insane, rude, uncultured, larger-than-life, caricatures of human beings (i.e. Mr.Chow), it would be easy for anyone to adopt these values and viewpoints toward Asian men. And don't get me started on the girls. Girls never even looked my way. I always just felt like a piece of furniture. In the minds of my female peers, I wasn't even a possibility amongst the choices of their suitors. So I could befriend them, but all I could really do was befriend the hell out of them. Whenever the friend I had even mentioned relationships and politely asked me about my love life, I would very bashfully respond of my lack thereof. Now for the guys. Of course wanting guy friends I would attempt to befriend guys but because I was not into playing any sports, watching sports, and doing anything stereotypically masculine, I was excluded and marginalized. I always thought that something was wrong with me and that being Asian was a negative thing. In my mind, if I were the handsome, blonde, blue-eyed, muscular and wealthy caucasian guy that almost every race of girl seemed to absolutely be in love with, all my problems would be gone and I would not have to suffer this incredible pain and marginalization. But coming to college has really helped change my mind. With so many groups based upon the celebration of one's culture, I've finally realized that I need not be mad at myself about something beyond my control and something that wasn't even bad to begin with! I realized that as an Asian-American, I had the advantage of being multi-cultural, multi-lingual, and just overall being a much more open-minded, worldly perspective compared to the average American. In addition, since I am pursuing a career in finance, I realized how much of an advantage it is that I am Asian. With China becoming such an enormous financial power, I will be able to use my cultural similarity to my advantage. Also, after finding a loving girlfriend, I've realized that I really do not lack anything. I am not lesser than anyone. There is nothing wrong with me and that I am perfectly fine just the way I am. I wanted to put this story on here because I know so many other ""self-loathing Asians."" I just want all of you out there reading this to know that you are enough. (if not more than)"

5149,2014-07-14 22:01:45,"3053
Well damn.  I didn't get into the school I was sure I was going to transfer to.  Now I have to return to shitty grades, a frigid campus, and that damn note.  Good thing my depression is back in full swing, so at least I don't go back with any false hopes of success."

Been there, done that. So now, no sex until marriage. No, I'm not super religious, nor do I want to be a born again virgin. I'm just done with everyone's bullshit."
5151,2014-07-14 22:39:49,"3051
I still think about you... I wish we could have something,  anything. Just to be closer to you..."
5152,2014-07-14 22:11:50,"3050
Well, I suppose it's as good a time as any to admit I've got a thing for a perfectly lovely, perfectly monogamous couple.  Of which one half is a very good, very straight friend.  #firstworldunicornproblems"

This is totally random, and I don't know if he will ever read this.......but last semester I randomly stumbled into sage chapel and this guy was playing the piano......organ......I want to say organ... by himself in a completely empty sage chapel . When he noticed I was there, he just smiled and kept playing, and I probably sat there by myself listening for half an hour with a huge stupid smile on my face. If you're out there, if for some reason you read this, I just want you to know that that moment crossed my mind, even fourth months after, and I would really love to hear you play again, and of course, finally meet you."

Dear ex, 
Been a few months since we broke up. I'm over you. I'm happy with my new girlfriend.  Move on with your life.  Don't message me again. 

Yours,"
5157,2014-06-30 12:10:57,"3045
I wish you understood how much I still care about you, how badly I want you to call me babe, how I long for you to text me. I just want you to give us a chance."

I'm conflicted about sex. On the one hand, I was always taught abstinence and that any even remotely sexual activity is ""disgusting."" On the other hand, I just really want to make love to my boyfriend."
5164,2014-06-30 12:33:19,"3038
I have very few memories from my life. I'm having trouble remembering most of what's happened prior to a year ago. I keep finding stuff on my computer that I did or or things I posted on the internet or old chats with friends and I am amazed at how little of it I remember, if any, and how little the things I seemed to care about still exist in my brain. I realize some of this is normal, but most of it is due to the fact that a lot of these ""memories"" were made either in front of a monitor or when I'd been by myself. I remember a lot of things that involved other people, but sadly not too many of these memories exist. Let that be a lesson to you all - very few moments that you share with no one, or that you only share with people through an internet connection will remain. Most of what you will remember, what you will call the ""best days of your life"", the things that you'll be thankful you did, all will involve other people in real life. Seems obvious I know, but it's an important thing to keep at the forefront of your mind, especially for those of you who think being alone/a computer can in any way substitute real life with real people. Any event that takes place in that context is insignificant even if it seems significant to you at the time. Don't waste your youth like I did. Get out there and make mistakes!

Sincerely,

An alum"

Yesterday I had to have a small surgical procedure, and it was my first time having anesthesia so I was a bit nervous. Before going in for surgery, my anesthesiologist came out and after he asked where I go for school he said he went to Cornell and began to sing me the Alma mater. I instantly felt much more comfortable with that Cornellian!"

I saw a girl today begging for money in downtown Ithaca. She had a sign that said ""Lost everything in a house fire. Every bit helps"". She didn't seem like a homeless person at all. She was well-dressed, clean, she looked quite presentable in fact. And she was weeping.... I could tell she was weeping not so much because she'd lost everything but because she now had to humiliate herself in this way. She looked quite intelligent, so the look on her face was sort of - I can't believe this, I don't belong here, this isn't who I am, but I don't have a choice. I could have misread that, but she seemed so incredibly sincere, this may have been the first time I saw a sign like this and believed every word. It was morning and it was cloudy and cold, it'd just rained. She'd curled up in a corner in this really nice jacket, almost trying to hide how dejected she was. I'm from NYC, so I didn't pay much attention at first, just walked by quickly, read the sign and didnt stop, but then as then as I was walking away all of the aforementioned realizations kicked in. I thought on my way back I would give her $10, wish her best of luck and tell her that you never know what tomorrow will bring. By the time I made my way back it'd started raining again and she was gone.... That made me sad. I hope things work out for her. She may have thought as she was sitting there that no one cared about her or her circumstance, but I did see you. I wish I could buy you a cup of coffee, discuss the situation and see if I could help in any way other than with a petty sum of money."

Cute blonde girl in Olin wearing a black tank top, whom I asked a random question as we were walking out - my question as totally meaningless, I just needed an excuse to talk to you."

I don't know what to do about the other guys back in ithaca..."
5213,2014-06-17 11:41:52,"2989
This is probably going to come out wrong but I'm an incredibly inteoverted person and I have too many friends. 

 It's really hard for me to juggle seeing them all time wise but if they're all together with me at a party or bar or something I get overwhelmed and want to go hide out in a corner. 

I don't know what to do because as time goes on I just keep meeting more amazing people but I'm not a social butterfly and need time to myself as well. I don't know how to find a balance."
5214,2014-06-17 11:06:53,"2988
I'm leaving Cornell and I have nothing to show for my time here but missed opportunities. The same can be extrapolated to my life. It's so stupid to just be genetically predisposed to not enjoy life. I am perfectly healthy, I'm smart and got into Cornell on my own merit with near full funding, I am above average looking, I will most likely get a great job... There is nothing preventing me from having a perfect life and enjoying it, but I just can't and I don't. I've never been happy. All the things that make people happy - money, family, boyfriend/girlfriend, friends, job, entertainment, going out, etc. I find absolutely no substance in. The only thing that ever made me happy was being alone with my thoughts and that's started to lose its value. I see no point to life. And I mean that in the most apathetic way possible. Meaning I'm not depressed/suicidal or anything. That would require me to have an attitude toward life. I have no attitude. There's just nothing."
5215,2014-06-17 11:05:54,"2987

I never thought I'd grow up to act like such a shitty person. I never thought I would try to kill myself while my younger sister was around, so that it affected her so much that she doesn't want to go to school, for fear that she'll come back home to find me dead or hospitalized again. I never thought that I would distance myself from my friends so greatly that I haven't even spoken to them in months, despite the fact that I may never see them again. I never thought I would fall in love as a teenager, stay with that guy for 7 years, and randomly decide to cheat on him with a guy I'd only spoken to twice when he was away for 3 months for security work; and, to make matters worse, have him come home to the situation after being shot multiple times."
5217,2014-06-17 11:29:57,"2985
So the big question is: should I have sex with him?
I technically am not in a relationship at the moment and he's been growing on me.
I don't want to lose a friend, although I'm pretty sure I won't.
I'd hate to keep saying ""what if""."

I honestly am hating life right now, when I might make a few people even jealous. I have a (what should be) awesome internship at a very top company, but I'm on day four and really don't have the confidence to be able to complete anything. Every day I dream about getting fired so that I can go home to my friends. And really the only reason I'm depressed is because, finally in my life, I realize I have spectacular friends with whom I actually do stuff, but cannot because I'm stuck hours away."
5222,2014-06-06 18:14:16,"2980

This year, I had to end my long-distance relationship because my then-girlfriend cheated on me. And at my new workplace, I see so many people cheating on their spouses, because they're away from their families. I'm losing faith in humanity."

I'm shadowing doctors at a hospital this summer and I really like one of the young doctors there. I've caught him staring at me more than once but maybe I'm just seeing what my heart wants me to see.

I'm not even sure if we were even dating, but that hasn't stopped me from missing you.

The reason these Elliot Rodger killings have struck such a nerve is that a lot of people – myself included – can identify with some of the feelings he raised in his “manifesto” and in his videos. What, does that make me an asshole? I’d be willing to bet there’s a lot of other people reading this who can read some of the things he expressed and see something similar to what they’ve felt. This cultural emphasis on sex as a measure of self-worth damages guys too. Did Rodger do terrible things? Obviously. Is there any excuse for what he did? Of course not. But lots of people out there can identify with him in a way no one identified with James Holmes or Adam Lanza et al. There’s nothing wrong with seeing that."

When I was a junior in high school, my then-girlfriend got pregnant and had an abortion. At the time, I told her I'd be supportive no matter what she chose, but I was secretly, selfishly, hoping she would get it. I've felt a lot of shame about the situation ever.

Now we've both graduated college, and she seems well. Cornell's a good school and I have a job lined up, and we're both moving on to the next stages of our lives. But I can't stop wondering if we did the right thing. The pregnancy severely damaged our relationship, and who knows if we could have gone the distance if we made a different decision."

After navigating a long distance relationship for 2 years I graduated and came home to him. Turns out he is a complete bum who was expecting to live off me now.

""When I found out about the murders committed by someone who doesn't even deserve to have his name mentioned, I was horrified. There was a confession earlier about sympathizing with people, and I agree about that, but that comes up to a point. He had a ton of therapists and help already, he was well off financially, and he had people giving him love advice. I don't think he could have gotten any more help. Even if he got some sunshine filled romance, he could have still become a disgruntled pariah, and used another excuse to kill (I seriously doubt romantic love of any kind can overcome any bitter, deep beliefs people have; I wish people would stop encouraging that, especially thinking that romance can heal depression on its own).

 I hate to toss the word """"entitled"""" around, but it sounded as if he felt he was entitled to sex without caring about women--enough to KILL PEOPLE. He thought it was an acceptable cause. Are people listening to the same news I am? Do people actually feel sorry for him after hearing about the hate he held that was strong enough to instigate murders? I live near the area where the shootings happened, and I don't feel like going outside much this summer anymore. And I am not going to feel bad for him. Ever. My heart goes out to the people he killed, and their grieving families, but I find it utterly ridiculous that he even gets sympathy, and hearing how fairytale love could have made the difference. No one talks about the victims. I have friends who knew the victims, and none of them seem to know how to deal with this, and I don't know what to do for them. All of the vigils and events intended to comfort the community don't really seem to dissuade the pain and fear. I can't even imagine how the families are coping. Being proximal to all of this, I find very scared and very angry people, but none of them feel sorry for the boy; everyone is busy with their emotions over the innocent people who deserved to have lived out their full lives. I've heard that even the parents feel more sorrow for the victims than their own son. I don't care if I hit a nerve, I don't care if some stupid argument starts on this confession trying to call me stupid or evil, about how if a girl had just given him a chance, but... But hearing about this over and over and over when I can't do anything about it, and no one outside of this community seems to remember the victims for more than two seconds, and are instead giving the dead shooter what he wanted and giving others no reason to not repeat it... I feel really sick. The kid gets to die with his name emblazoned forever, while the victims lost their chance to ever leave their mark on the world--he took away even that chance for them. No one is going to remember them."""

I am a rising junior with a 2.5 gpa. It rose from my 2.3 after freshmen year, but what am I going to do? Sure, I can affiliate with the college of engineering and still be an engineer like I want to, but is that enough? I have to start worrying about jobs, internships, and getting hired. My dreams of research have already been shot down by my awful gpa. And now I just got a U for something that only required attendance. I'm just screwed. All those stories I've heard of kids improving don't seem to apply to me. All I wanted was to learn and make myself use to the world but I can't do anything right here.

""Goodbye is the saddest word. But even though we promised it wasn't really goodbye, I cried. I cried and I cried and I cried because I know that all that's left of the little, beautiful, spark we had is ashes. A spark that you ignited, after all. Then she came back into your life. Even though you didn't tell me anything I know you were headed straight for her right after we shared our last words for now. I don't know what hurts more, not having you here anymore, or the fact that your heart always belonged to her, even when you were right here holding me. I know you didn't want to hurt me so you didn't tell me to my face. I could tell you were extremely anxious to be free toward the very end. Not sure if I would've preferred you telling me or just continuing on all this uncertainty that I'm living with now.
It literally feels like someone is trying to stab at my heart and keeps knocking the wind right out of me. I'm putting up a fight but keep getting weaker with every blow.

I am a girl. I have a 28-inch waist, 36-inch bust, a classically 'feminine' face shape, large eyes, the works, and often get compliments for my appearance. The only significant period of time I've ever gone without sex has been entirely decided upon by myself and easily dealt with through masturbation (side note: my sister was shocked when I mentioned this to her because she didn't know girls can touch themselves - ladies, please please explore!); otherwise, I have had no trouble finding a willing partner. I have a loving boyfriend (for anybody looking to judge, he has been my only sexual partner since the start of our relationship, but if that were not the case that would be a matter entirely between him and me) and a tight-knit group of friends, and I adore the people that have surrounded me throughout my college career.

That being said, as I begin to read through Elliot Rodger's manifesto and watch his Youtube videos, I empathize with him more than most seem to. Despite being an attractive female, I understand the trauma he has faced with social anxiety preventing him from bonding to people. In fact, until I met my boyfriend, I could never imagine truly opening up to anybody about the pain and abuse I've experienced (unfortunately I seem to always have attracted a bit more sexual attention than I wanted, including from a then-trusted acquaintance who took the opportunity to provide me with an extremely unwanted and painful sexual debut at a far younger age than appropriate), and he has done an unbelievable job of teaching me to trust and love, as well as acknowledge my negative emotions and show me how to deal with them positively. While I have chosen to keep that experience from my friends here because I hope it is hardly relevant to them, my boyfriend's patience and love has helped me forge true connections with them. I know that had I not met him, my mental state would likely never have retreated from the suicidal tendencies I hardly ever face now.

I was very lucky to have met such an incredible partner. I believe that hardly anybody finds somebody so perfect for themselves, and especially not at such a young age. It is even harder for a person terrified of saying the wrong thing or worse, not saying the right thing and then freezing from the terror of isolation and exhaustion from constant failed efforts. I have experienced Elliot's impossible desire to be in the popular, preppy crowd and knowing I'd never fit in, shallow as it now seems to my current self who can't decide between buzzing her head or dyeing it a rainbow. I know I only have that self-confidence because somehow, impossibly, I've found social validation. What's more, I've become cocky enough to know that if I somehow lose my current group of friends, I'll find a new one.

Elliot was not so lucky, and I shudder to think that, had our social fates been switched, he would have calmly graduated this spring while I sunk deeper and deeper into my old melancholy. I found help, but how could you judge somebody for not being lucky enough to find a healthy way to end their suffering? Nobody looks out at the world and says, ""You know, I want to be remembered as a murderer and a socially awkward loser."" Look through his Youtube channel - he tried to find happiness in appreciating the beauty of nature, he tried constantly to find love, but he couldn't satisfy himself with the former and couldn't succeed in the later. That's enough to drive anybody mad. He does not deserve the hatred now poured thickly upon him. How can you not pity him? He never got to mature into the confident young man he so desperately tried to portray. 

There are many posts on here from people who are lonely at Cornell. Often, people comment asking the OP to lunch, or a walk, or anything. Please, please, please if you feel alone here, know that there are always others in the community looking out for you. I love you, no matter what your life story. I don't care if you're a rapist or a rape victim, on probation or the Dean's List, in the 1% or the 99%, you all need love and acceptance and please realize that if you felt as if you had no support system, you too would grow desperate. Please realize that you always have a support system within Cornell's community. Go to EARS, or CAPS, or write an anonymous confession to find a friend, or invite an interesting acquaintance to dinner, or join a club, or comment on here. Please remember you are loved, and you are interesting and important and wanted.

Have an amazing summer, Cornell, and please try not to judge. I apologize for this post's lack of cohesiveness."

It's weird; I feel like within my lifetime my faith in Christianity has wavered and shattered like waves. And I'm not talking about the depression, the senseless misfortune that befalls people for no cosmic reason (you can't justify misfortune for the sake of teaching people when you can just create them knowing things? Like why would a ""lonely, jealous"" God create beings that could ""technically abandon him when these things will anger and sadden him? But then again, he knows everything, so what does it matter? If some babies intrinsically know how to doggie paddle (correct me if I'm wrong about that), I'm sure a God that can make the world in X days/years/ millenia can make it so that we aren't intrinsically jerks. 

And what about the news? I read an article about a study done by Israeli ARCHAEOLOGISTS that says the fossil record and domestication patterns of camels are askew from the accounts of the Old Testament by thousands of years? ANd the worst part is that fundamentally religion (or ""faith-based lifestyles"") are based on proselytizing people around you, yet religion is supposed to be this borderline taboo. How are we going to move forward as a civilization if we can't have open dialogue about things? Same goes for mental illness, rape and sexual assault; we gotta talk about these things. 

It may sound like I'm against Christianity in particular, but I just want to know the truth. If the most popular religions didn't seem like politicians trying to sway voters but hiding things from the same voters, then we'd probably be a lot closer to figuring stuff out than where we are right now."

Is diversity only about admission stats and percentage? I started asking this when in freshman year my roommate said that he hoped to switch and had a white roommate. Now I believe even more so after spending 2 years here, especially when I'm at CollegeTown Saturday nights. I find correlation between greek life and diversity so awkward. Fortunately I recently start finding some true diversity among people in my major."

Not a confession but - these confessions are consuming my feed! I thought Facebook was broken because I hit the home button and I thought I was on the Cornell University Confessions page."
5311,2014-05-24 12:05:15,"2881

My hearts broken. I lost the only person i cared about in this world. From being fond of each other to now never talking. From being the person u tell everything, to being the person u do not tell anything.  Please do not hate me. Please dont. I am sorry i broke ur heart, but mine was broken too and because of pain i got bitter. Forgive me."

The way some guys talk about trying to get girls drunk in order to sleep with them really freaks me out. That's planned rape. Most of them aren't serious but its still scary to think that people would take things like that lightly."

Sometimes I feel like I don't belong here. Everyone around me just seems so much smarter than me. All of my friends get A's and B+'s in their classes while I'm over here like uhh... Literally I could have gone to any other school and probably get a 3.7-4.0 GPA. But I chose here because of the name and its reputation and now my GPA suffers badly. I want to be pre-med but with these grades I don't think I have a chance."

Hey chick from Mother Cabrini... you need to break up with your boyfriend. He is fucking you and your emotions. You are failing to see that. I can only see from afar and can't help out because I actually do care for you even though you make me the enemy. I have no reason to hate you. But you're a bitch and hypocritical piece of crap who likes getting fucked by someone who doesn't even love you. So... enjoy getting fucked... bitch. You know who you are Balch [redacted] girl... [redact-arino!]... breaking up will make your life 25000000% percent easier. On top of that you should stop bringing your negative influence on to all of us. You are doing more bad than good to us. your negativity reaches even me. But anyways go fuck yourself."

Freshman year is officially over. I can't believe it went so quickly and I had such an amazing year. But I'm worried because I KNOW my GPA could've been decently higher. Does having an amazing year make up for the fact that my GPA is low? How do I bounce back from this? I feel like I've screwed up because I should've started college off strong with a high GPA but I don't regret that I had fun and had a great year either... any advice on how to bounce back from this?"

5334,2014-05-24 11:50:53,"2858

Um, I still miss you.  WHY did you never try to talk to me when we were in my room, when I told you about how I felt that you weren't treating me well as a friend, and also how you didn't VOICE your OWN opinions, expressing individuality and uniqueness that made me like you in the first place??  I can't understand why you didn't at least try to understand what I was saying and GIVE ME some type of response.  All you said was idk idk idk idk , idk idk idk idk.  I would have waited for you for years, even if you expressed later on that you felt I wasn't right for you.  It would have been all cool with me.  Really, it would have been all cool.  I don't understand why girls in general give mixed signals and try to act like they're not interested or don't AT LEAST care to have a guy friend around them.  WHO WAS THERE to help you with your calc homework? WHO WAS THERE to give you encouragement when you were stressed out? WHO WAS THERE to talk to you? WHO WAS THERE to eat food with you almost every day? I feel like life is unfair a lot of times to guys who have good intentions but can't get a girl because she's either too attached to home or someone at home. Do me a favor and grow up, you were different than anything I saw before and I don't understand why you couldn't change a little, even a tiny tiny little, to see me for what I was.

I can't do this anymore I'm becoming too emotional and I was supposed to MOVE ON more than a year ago since I last talked to you.  I mostly have, but I still can't care about anyone.  Remember when I told you that too?  I feel emotionless, even though I still have close friends that are almost all guys.  I feel that I'm going to get MORE hurt if I like someone and then I won't trust anyone for good for my whole life.  It's nice to know that you laughed at me because I ate the same food (pizza) every day at Appel or RPCC, and that you laughed at me when I texted you as a ""joke"" but you yourself never texted me before as a friend to even say hi.  It's nice to know that you weren't even honest with me and another girl told me that you were basically lying to me, and that you needed to be honest with me.  WHY weren't you?? ...why? It's also nice to know that you knew I was mad at you but didn't even come to say what's up, to at least try to salvage something before I talked with you.  OH WAIT LET ME THINK, what kind of damn friend is that, if even a person who I would want to be my girlfriend, someone who is supposed to be with ME? I'll give you a translation baby - I mean someone who rides with me and listens to what the hell I'm thinking and at least gives HALF A DAMN.  But wait, remember that I won't forget about you - I ALWAYS listened to what you're saying too and I praised you.  You made me happy.  Remember when I used to knock on your door to wake you up for class? Lol I was such an idiot, I should have let you gone late, and your GPA would have been even lower than it already was for your first semester.  And I could have used someone's support when I was going through stuff later on.  And you know what the hell I'm talking about, ""stuff"" is an understatement for what happened to me.

And these emotions don't help with the hell that I had to go through this year.  I guess I'll just sleep and go on with my daily routine tomorrow, I'll find a way to keep on going and be stronger so that no one can ever hurt me again.  No one, not even you.  You.  I definitely have trust issues with regular girls that I meet at places I work, etc.  Thanks for this too, I really love it!!

And then you go on to tell someone that you were only emotionally attracted to me.  DON'T even say that.  AND THEN YOU ASK HOW I'M DOING in the beginning of this school year to other people that I talk to.. don't even say that either. I don't understand why you tried to make everything so complicated, I made everything so simple by just trying to hang out and get to know you.  I still can't understand it.  And I can't understand why you're so political with everyone, who cares if someone doesn't like you? I cared about you more than anyone who could have hated you."

I've never felt more alone than during my time here at Cornell, I'm very glad that I'm graduating and starting a new chapter in my life. I don't mean to sound bitter; I don't despise my Cornell experience. In many ways it's taught me valuable lessons about friendship, fitting in, self-image and the importance of being yourself. I regret not spending enough time with the people I truly like. Instead, I followed crowds, hanging out with people that are simply acquaintances at best. It's an embarrassing revelation that I realize with humility. Everybody always makes it seem like you find your best friends in college - I guess I just fell through the cracks."

I moved in with some of the cruelest, most narcissistic, whiny, immature beings I have ever encountered last semester.
All I can say is looking back, at least I can always assure myself that it was them, and not me. 
I respect people from the get-go but they ruined that by trying to be controlling and through their extremely rude and hurtful comments/actions. 
One thing I am definitely not is a pushover-mentally or physically.
No one other than God or maybe my mother (sometimes) can tell me what and how to do something, or live my life. 
I have enough self-respect to keep my distance, but nobody else can truly know how terrible these people are, that's the scariest part."

Let's just say I've become highly disillusioned with people of my culture at Cornell lately. While some if not most of them are really genuine people, others really have tried to disturb my peace this past year. I came to Cornell with the idea of fitting in to this identity and helping serve ""my people"" but at the rate that some of ""my own people"" have tried to bulldoze my self esteem, I am beginning to question the value that sticking up for ""my people"" has to me. (Because it includes some of the most evil spirited people I've ever met.)
A big part of me wants to just say ""fuck you"" and move out of the community.
Another part of me sees the faces of some of my best friends and supporters pleading for me to stay.

I think I need a semester abroad...."

If you ever feel down, remember the 238 Nigerian girls who were kidnapped more than a month ago and still haven't been found. Remember that you're probably in better position them.

I had a friend who graduated. We managed to stay in touch for awhile. I was still in school, and she was unemployed. She constantly complained about how her other Cornell friends all had jobs and lives and had forgotten about her. So who was the one giving her support and encouragement through her job search? Me. But eventually she got a job and a life too, and I was all but forgotten. Upset and confused, I begged to know where she was, and when she finally came back to me, she snapped. What she told me, essentially, was that she no longer had time for me and our friendship was not a priority. I'm starting to think that it never was. What upsets me the most, though, is that she did to me exactly what she complained her own friends did to her. I'm over it now, but it stung. Treat others the way you want to be treated."

Took me three full years to figure out why I have been unhappy. It's not the academic stress of Cornell, it's that I don't have any real friends. I realized tonight that I've only had people here I hang out with sometimes. I realized that for as much as these people know me, they're really just acquaintances. And, in realizing this, I truly see what my problem is. I'm not unhappy, I'm just profoundly lonely."

I miss you. When we first met I had the inkling that you liked me and I want to apologize to you for being so darn busy that I couldn't start anything. You asked me to give you a call and I never did-- not because I did not want to but by the time I could, I figured it would be out of the blue and too awkward. I want to be with you, but now you've joined a sorority and I am sure you are so surrounded by guys you probably don't think of me anymore. I've never been able to talk to someone so easily, and if we can't be together, at the very least I don't want to lose a promising friend.

Asian guy in the library who is on Thai Boxing who coughs, yawns, and ""ahhhh"" crazy loud--- you know who you are. Please stop.

I can't believe the year is done. There are so many emotions in that for me. I'm going to miss my boyfriend.  I'm going to miss my ex more than I currently do. My friends are going back to their homes all around the world. I'm not ready for the year to end and next year absolutely terrifies me, even though intellectually I know that it will be great. And most of this I keep bottled up because I'm uncomfortable letting it out. And it's eating away at me."

I'm usually in the libraries studying, especially for big tests like the finals, but I haven't been going. Why? Because I'm really sick and I can't stop coughing, sneezing, or blowing my nose, and I think nobody else should have to deal with all that noise when they're trying to focus. I know I wouldn't want that, so I just hole myself up in my room like a bum and study there :) I know many people are often sick and talking in the libraries, but I have no intention on being another one of those people passing on their illnesses (being in such close proximity) and being a distraction. Good luck on your finals guys!"

Its during this time of year, that I get this painful burning sensation. I know I'll always have the memories, but it stings all the same that we're all moving on with our lives and I won't see my friends till the next year. To the MECA community here at Cornell, I love you all and I wish I could tell each and every one of you how much you all mean to me."

I think i love someone dearly. I care about her more than most things. I always try to be there for her. I honestly want her to be always happy. Yet i know she likes someone and as days go i feel more and more jealous :(. I do not like this feeling. I do not like this feeling at all."

To all you people who play LoL at 5am at the back at Phillips Lab, I hope you all get severe hernias and get expelled from Cornell. I'm going to make sure that those computers are reprogrammed such that you can never engage in your mindless activity ever again. It disturbs the hell outta people trying to do real things."

For me the recycling bin is just another trash can located conveniently next to an already existing trash can. It's kinda like how in the SpongeBob movie Mr. Krabs builds another Krusty Krab next to the already existing one. I could care less in which trash bin I put my garbage in. One is just prettier (the blue one) than the other."

I recently survived two near-death experiences with relatively little damage from causes that were completely out of my control and not my fault. I've been told to thank god for allowing me to live but lately I've been thinking he intentionally tried to put me out of my misery.
I have been extremely depressed and lonely lately with little motivation to even get up in the morning. Is it possible that God wants to kill me out of mercy?

Also, as a sidenote to those that respond, i am not christian nor do i wish to convert."

I do this weird thing when I'm a state of semi-dreaming/semi-awake where I want to conduct a test to see if there's a chance what just happened in my dream (which is usually AMAZING/exactly what want to happen to me) is actually real. While I'm in that state I'm not sure what's real yet, so I have to test it. So I send an email to myself in the dream, thinking if I receive the email, it means this actually happened in the real world. Then I start to think - mind you STILL not being sure what's real! - ""Okay, let's think rationally here. You're in your bed. Can an email that you send in your head actually somehow connect to the Internet and be sent""? Then what happens is I think more and more about it and slowly convince myself it can't be real, both through deductive reasoning and through slowly starting to wake up and realize dreams aren't real. That's then followed by disappointment and the beginning of another lonely day."

I'm really sad I don't have a close guy best friend. Every time I think I could have one, they are interested in more than just friendship. And when I tell them I'm not interested in them like that, they stop texting back, even though they seem like genuinely nice guys. 
I just want a friend who I can curl up and cry on when I'm sad. Someone who had help me feel safe. But will also be so dumb and just lounge around and make jokes. Like a big brother or something. 
I just can't seem to find one. :/"

I despise people who throw trash into recycle cans. If you are enough of a idiot to not do something as simple as recycling- fine, that is your individual mistake. By throwing trash into recycle cans though, you ruin the entire consignment and waste the effort of people who do actually care about the planet we live on. For god sake, don't be such a dimwit."

I can cook you dinner or help you with a paper or even mow your lawn. I can get rid of the house centipede infestation in your apartment. I also possess an uncanny volume of plant knowledge, so I can heal your sick houseplants. In other words, pleasepleasePLEASE turn it in :'("

The truth is even though I hooked up with other guys and spent the last 2 days crying when the guy I went out on a date with didn't get in contact with me, I still think about you all the time. We were together not even officially so briefly in the beginning of the year but you were some of my firsts. You acted like a douche; I know you're bad for me and you barely cared about me. But part of me just wants to say screw it; I'm here for 3 more days and I want to be with you one more time. It's so crazy and I hate myself for even thinking it, for even acknowledging it or wishing for it after so much time has passed and so much crap I took from you. But I know better and I know more and the problems I brought to what we had are less relevant. It would be crazy and I don't know how I could look at myself after but part of me wants to... then the other part says you might develop some stupid expectations or see it for more than it is. I know we could never be together, but part of me still wants something from you. It's crazy. We've had numerous talks and opportunities for me to get closure. Calling you up would be totally unlike me and what I stand for...heart vs. mind. This is so irrational."
5439,2014-05-16 21:00:27,"2753

""I wrote this poem in like 10th grade and it still applies to my life now... sad.

Now I know why they call it a crush;
But in all honesty, maybe I was expecting too much.
Because all I wanted was to feel your touch; with your hands entwined in mine.
And is it pathetic that every time you smiled it made my day?
All that things that I planned to do and wanted to say;
Nothing will happen.
It’s hard to accept; that feelings so bright could not be returned;
My sweaty palms, nervous giggles, & mute voice with which you weren’t even concerned.
Why did I allow you to affect me in this way when you didn’t even care?
I sit here & sigh & think the clichéd words that life’s not fair.
When it is right it’ll happen, & you and me were definitely not right.
But what gives me solace is that my future flies limitlessly in the wind like a kite.
This may be the end of us & my butterflies may have had their wings ripped off so violently,
But you know what? Go kiss that smut! While my prince appears beside me silently"""

To the freshman who is partially bald (and I'm really sorry that's how I have to define you, I just don't know much else about you!!) I have had a crush on you all year. I just think you're so attractive, but I have no idea how to approach you! Wouldn't it be weird if a complete stranger (we've never talked or anything) just asked you to coffee out of the blue?"

I started dating a guy early last semester and a few months later we ended things on a bitter note because he didn't like the fact that I was graduating and moving to a different city for grad school. The break up was really tough on me. A few days ago, right as I had started to heal, we got in touch again and he wants to work things out between us. I don't know what to do.."

I joke and laugh about being single my entire life but on the inside it's actually killing me. By ""Single"", I'm not saying I've never been in a serious relationship. I mean I've had absolutely zero encounters with anyone: no hookup, no kisses, no dates, no holding hands, no flirting, no one showing the slightest sign of interest. I've given up on ever feeling like someone will want me."

I can honestly remember the first time my mother told me to stop wishing that I would grow up faster stop wishing that I would be able to drive and stop wishing to become an adult, because your childhood is something you never get back.... I can remember when I was told by my older friends not to rush through high school because it is the last time you will be able to live in the blissfully ignorant world and not have real responsibilities. Now, as I stare my junior year in the eye, the scary half way point of my college period, the ""best four years of my life"", I wish I could really go back. I would give anything to go back to that first awkward day when I moved into my freshmen dorm. I would kill to be stuck in my shitty OL group with my boring OL leader. I would love to be awkwardly running around College town, not knowing which frats were ""cool"", just looking for a sick time to be had. What I have realized is that these four years are priceless. They are experiences I will remember for the rest of my life, these are friendships I will carry on forever, and these are people who will be as close to me as family. I guess what Im trying to get at here is I wish I stopped and just enjoyed the moment in my previous two years at Cornell, and life in general, but i sure intend to do this more often in the years to come. Cornell, through all the finals, ""study weeks"" and shit that you have given me [and will give me], these are years and experiences I wouldn't trade for anything else. Although finals week is an experience most dread, I know that in a few short weeks I would love nothing less than to be here at my desk studying my ass off, running on no sleep, and having drank far too many cups of coffee because this is place like no other, in a time of my life I will remember forever."

I find it really weird and hypocritical when people insult others who choose to have video game/anime/cartoon characters as their profile picture, and then they themselves have a picture that has like 20 people, or they're in the far background, and you can't tell who is even in the picture. And then they complain that the fictional character pictures are stupid, and a way to hide? ""Real"" picture or not, if I were to just look at either kind of picture, I would probably have no idea whose profile it belonged to. Stop sounding so condescending."

""
Last year I was sexually assaulted.

I was at a party with friends, and a boy started dancing behind me.  I was put off by how he somehow materialized behind me and started grinding without a word from me, but he knew my friends and I didn’t want to make a fuss.  A few minutes later, he turned me around, grabbing my head and my neck while he forced his face into mine.  I felt violated, helpless, and at the same time disgusted with myself for letting it happen. I left the party immediately and had to shower for over an hour before I could calm down enough to tell my friends why I had left. It took months before I was able to go out again socially, let alone drink in group settings.

When I told my friends about how traumatic it was, they dismissed me, saying he was an awkward kid and he was drunk, and that it was a misunderstanding. But still, I couldn’t even walk into Libe Cafe because in the months after, every time I went near, I’d see him there with a smug look on his face, staring at a library-issued laptop as if he prowled the library just so that I couldn’t.

I know my experience with sexual assault pales in comparison to many of the horror stories I’ve heard, and knowing how much my experience affected me negatively, I can’t even begin to imagine how traumatic it must be for women who have had worse things done to them.  You can laugh and joke all you want about the gratuitous usage of the term “rape culture” but don’t deny its existence.  And when you reminisce on all the wonderful times as an undergrad, know that others aren’t so lucky, and that one incident can poison 
an entire experience."

I wish a crazy dictator would come along who would commit genocide and the gene he would go after would be the gene for attractiveness, meaning targeting attractive people. It would be a terrible tragedy of course, but maybe about 2% fair because life for them is so immeasurably better, it's ridiculous. It's a million times better to be attractive than to be rich. People treat you better, you're only single if you choose to be and you can get whoever you want, you have a higher self esteem, you make friends easier, you probably get a job easier and get promoted easier. Life is so much better as an attractive person and it's the one thing we have no control over. Look at this campus - if you see a truly beautiful girl she's almost always in a top sorority or is in some other way enjoying a high social status and she's often kind of cold and borderline rude - I would be too if all my life I've had to make no effort to make friends or date whoever I wanted and everyone's treated me like a goddess. It's really not her fault... It's just the way the world works. Greatest injustice no one can do anything about."

I think I made a mistake cutting someone out of my life.  I know this person could never be the friend I needed, but when he got me, he really got me.  He's dealt with some of the same trials I have and it is hard trying to connect to those who haven't.  There is so much judgment that it is hard to let your guard down, but you still try.  But when the people you try with don't understand, it is that much more painful."

Every day that passes in this last lap teaches me something new about life, and more specifically, about life at Cornell. Today's lesson: If I were to die the day after I graduate, none of the ""friends"" I have made here would care. Most people here have no depth. This makes my decision to go back home to my family, forever, after graduation the perfect decision. Every second in which I suffer, my family suffers with me.

But I'm not like that. If I walk into something having no expectations, knowing nothing beyond this instance can transpire, my reasoning is what's the point in going through with it? I wanted you to at least talk to me. I wasn't expecting to jump into anything serious given we're leaving soon--but I guess I wanted to know that the reason you even asked me was because you were interested/somewhat liked me. I'm an eternally disappointed fool and wish I was a girl guys felt lucky to have and scared to lose verses being treated like the dog poop on the bottom of their shoes. I guess if I learn anything at Cornell it'll be to stop expecting anything. There's no disputing that there's good guys here, but as for the rest, half of them are too scared to try anything real and the other half have convinced themselves they don't want anything real."

I feel really stupid posting something so trivial when everyone's stressed about finals and grades, but it really bothers me that I'm 20 years old and I've never been in a relationship. In high school I felt a little rejected but it didn't phase me as much because I knew that when I got to college there would be a plethora of individuals I could possibly date...but I've been here two years and nothing! It's so discouraging to think that half my college career is over and I've never once had a guy interested in me. NOT ONCE! It makes me feel so inadequate and terrible about myself. And I know you shouldn't measure you self-worth by the amount of attention you receive from the opposite sex but it's still a confidence booster, a validation that you're a somewhat decent human being. I just really wish someone could see that in me, could notice me and not find me lacking. Again, I'm sorry for how trivial and vain that was."

""While I'm sure there are plenty of kindhearted individuals at Cornell who don't do this:

It is in no way fair for some people to judge, victimize, and bully others, especially when you can never know what someone else is truly going through, whether it be mental or physical illness. 

A little detail that is meaningless to you may torment someone else for a very long time, causing them much distress or even illness. None of us are made from the same mold-there is no standard reaction to trauma.

So next time you're about to be a follower and bother or make fun of someone, think twice and be a leader-a person who respects others as the HUMANS that they are- REGARDLESS of race/ethnicity, gender, religion, or beliefs. 

And to all of my friends who have suffered as victims of others' words or actions, please take care of yourselves, stay strong, talk to people you trust, keep engaging in your life to the fullest,
 and 
most importantly don't ever forget to be the better person by trying your best to NOT EVER let how badly others treat you define your actions and who you are.

Stay true to YOU, a good you, the best you possible.

I have seen so many girls who subject themselves to humiliation because they think the guy is “too” good for them. No. Everyone is valuable in one way or another. You deserve someone who treats you well and in return, you should treat him with integrity and sincerity. A relationship based on lies will not miraculously turn into love."

If people were responsive, I would smile and say ""hi"" to everyone. Maybe that's just my Californian culture though..."

Sometime i feel my life is like a Deja Vuu. I have had experiences which have been extremely similar on a few occasions and all of them have to be with respect to relationships. Every time i get told by the person that i think too much. Somehow every time i beg to differ. I see change and i do not know how to react to it. Sometimes u arrive in a persons life when they are in between things. They need u but when the real thing comes along they leave u stranded. I have experienced this far too often in my life. At times i feel there is something really wrong with me, then at times i am sure that whatever changes i see are so real and that i am not making these up. Whatever it is,  its a unhealthy and a uneasy feeling. I should stop caring about every person i meet and may be just learn to be like everyone else without caring about anyone but myself. I feel  disheartened, eventually i always end up blaming myself and hurting and punishing myself for every little thing. Please make this stop. It hurts beyond belief :("

Earlier this semester I overheard a girl in class tell her friend that, as an EARS counselor, she would privately mock students that she counseled with another EARS counselor. She casually joked about the serious issues the people she counseled had. I haven't utilized EARS here but I have reached out to counseling services in times of trouble. I understand the anxiety and hesitation of opening up to complete strangers about intensely personal issues. While she didn't reveal any confidential information, the conversation really made me lose faith in EARS, which claims to be a judgement-free and understanding resource."

""To #2539,

There are myriad, truly a limitless number of reasons someone could be struggling with depression or suicidality. Please don't reduce any of our problems to something that can be fixed with """"one little effort"""". I'm not even doubting that you struggled with actual depression, but its source might've been something you could do something about quicker or more easily than other people could. 

I agree that treatment would probably set someone struggling on a better path, but as someone who is currently on meds and in CAPS for years now, I honestly can't say too much about them being """"ridiculously good"""" at what they do. And let's not even get started on those with limited access to health care (luckily CAPS fees can be waived, but medication costs cannot), or those with zero support systems or with families that stand in the way of getting treatment. As much as I want everyone to realize how precious life is and not give up, I also know that the fact that some live constantly on the brink of suicide doesn't necessarily mean they're not doing all they currently can about their problems.

Same goes for depressed people who post on this page. Granted, anyone struggling out there SHOULD seek treatment if they aren't already because you may be surprised by how treatable your issues actually are, and sometimes a slight boost in happiness is enough to pull you from the brink. But they should also feel free to use this page as an outlet, as opposed to bottling things up, especially if it's the only outlet they feel like they have."""

I'm really sick of the video circulating Facebook, the one criticizing social media in forced rhyme. Excluding the hilariously obvious fact that it required Facebook to become popular, as well as the over the top emotional appeals, it isn't a new thing to ignore people over technology--my parents and other adults have talked about similar treatment with transistor radios, newspapers, walkmans, etc. There are many things wrong with the overgeneralized messages in the video, such as the huge exaggeration of smartphone use (at least from what I see among my friends), and even at Cornell, I rarely see people dumb enough to walk across the street with a smartphone. It's important to have balance between everything--how is there anything wrong with using a phone on a bus bench, just waiting?--but the video just makes it sound evil in general, and to me that seems lazy. (It'd probably be more able to address both sides of the issue if it didn't try to chain the message to an annoying rhyme scheme.) I also seriously doubt that, before smartphones, everyone walked up to every stranger they met to talk. I think we should use that sort of technology less, since it's distracting (although I personally don't even have a smart phone), but we shouldn't turn them off or throw them into the gorges. I'm going to stop here, but the video has so much more available criticism..."

""To all of the people who post on here about their depression and suicidal thoughts:

Listen to me. I have been there. What you need to do is get help, not post on a confessions page. Modern medicine and counseling are ridiculously good at what they do. Go to EARS or Gannet. Go get help and I guarantee you won't regret it. One little effort, and you'll see the light and feel happiness again, just like I did."""

""Dear PSB boy,

I just wanted to let you know that every stolen glance and meaningful look you gave me while I was hanging out there or other places was probably the highlight of my day that day, and that I always had the intention of saying hi but would freeze as soon as I saw you. You made me incredibly nervous for some reason. When I finally got the guts to say something, I sounded stupid/ridiculous and you seemed distracted/disinterested, so I didn't pursue anything further. But thank you for making my stressful and busy semester a little brighter! Good luck on your finals!"

I'm not mentally stable enough to keep going like we were. I'm afraid I'm not going to make it, and I don't want to hurt you. It tore me up inside watching your face through that terrible excuse, but I had to do it. You don't deserve that.

The last 2 weeks I have been easily 10 times hornier than I've ever been in my life. Scratch that, 10 times hornier than all other times combined. I have no idea what's triggering this, some rogue hormone or something...? I don't know, but all of a sudden 95% of girls on campus look insanely gorgeous and I am eyefucking every one of them. I hope this period ends soon. It's crazy, I cannot focus on anything. There are so many of them. They are everywhere and they are so hot. It's like torture. It's gotten me to talk to a lot more of them, which is good, but I'd really like my brain to start regulating this a little, or I'm gonna lose my mind. Whomever said that Cornell didn't have pretty girls needs to get inside my head. Or really just needs to visit this campus.

I had a pretty chill, yet eventful slope day. I ran into 80% of people that I know, tied up some loose ends, found out that people I thought hated me were okay with me, and took some hits. By the end of the concert, I ended up chilling at a friend's house talking to one of his friends from back home. I was laying on the couch, probably coming on a little too strong from the liquid courage, talking to this girl. And she was sooooo chill, and insightful. I didn't want to smash at all, and that's not me saying that to avoid sounding like all those other guys. But it was just so serene. Just talking. Two people understanding each other on a deeper level than a game of pong or grinding to a song would usually do. I miss talking to people without me thinking in the back of my head ""what if they expect something of me and I fail?"" or some shit. That moment really gives me hope for the future, for smiles, for love. I dipped afterwards bc the grass started making me feel unsettled af, but I hope I can meet more amazing people like that.

Many would call me an attractive guy. Most girls here care so much about greek life, that it's annoying or they're very superficial. They gossip about each other like they're in high school. I can totally relate to that poster who said they felt as if they were going to a school with a bunch of overgrown children. I'm so over undergrads. I can't wait to get out into the real world and meet mature women who don't just like me for my looks; they actually have hobbies other than partying and going out. This probably comes off as close-minded, and I know there are plenty of women out there not like this. I'm just venting my frustrations. Don't even get me started on ""frat bros""....this is how I felt as an undergrad here. For those of you who can relate to this, don't worry, things get better in the real world. People during undergrad are still figuring themselves out for the most part. There are a few gems out there though.

And by fate, I mean the massive crowd of people pushing you into me, my complete indifference towards grinding on whomever I'm standing in front of (even super aggressive creeps who just pull me towards them), and my desire to resume treating you as if you don't exist as soon as the concert ended.

""I consider myself to be the ardent hip-hop/rap enthusiast. I happen to be male. Still, I was also irked by Ludacris' comments on """"kidnapping Cornell girls"""", """"clean vaginas"""", and all that crass sh*t. It was pretty degrading and an awful filler for a performance that, in my opinion, was just okay. By then, the majority of us had already tolerated some lyrics that cut pretty deep to some (it's all about lyrical context vs. context doesn't matter). And, given recent events in Northern Nigeria, a worldwide problem of human trafficking/sex trade, and the stubborn rape culture existent abroad and on home soil, it just wasn't okay.

Anyways, just here to let Cornell women now that there guys out there who have your back. You had the right to feel offended. To put it simply, this just wasn't cool. Some of us were pretty surprised and disgusted too.  Please note that not all of hip-hop/rap artists (mostly men) are as misogynistic - there are some that aren't at all, in fact. Many of the former make plenty of songs that are more inoffensive/acceptable and great to dance to like you don't give a f*ck. Yeah, a hypocritical dichotomy right there. They're merely another product of a larger society/culture that has taught men to think of women in a particular manner. And it's not just hip-hop/rap that is an enabler for this type of mindset - commercials, tv shows, other musical genres, etc. Just see it as another reflection of how men across the aboard need be raised differently. Hopefully, we'll get a better act next year or, at least, we can hold them to some kind code of conduct while at Cornell. """

So for the longest time I wanted to meet this guy. Regretted not having the balls to do it. Last week I finally did and was surprised at how people can still open up to you when given the chance. Suffice it to say it has renewed my hope in humankind but more importantly I feel lighter and ready to move forward. As this year comes to a close I encourage everyone to accomplish their own to do list and go out of their way to meet that special someone. No regrets."

I want to find a girl who adores me as much as I adore her. I want a relationship where neither of us have to even try to enjoy each other's company. If she's kind and down to earth, she'd be gorgeous in my eyes. We'd understand each other's humor and it would be so easy for us laugh. And she would not just be an object of sexual desire. I'd respect her and support her the same way she'd do to me. But I'd still sexually desire her ;) And the relationship wont be confining; we wont be bound to each other indefinitely. If this girl exists, and she definitely does, i want to ask her to dinner and see where things go. If we like each other a lot, we could get drunk together. But this is just my romanticized fantasy."

I know we haven't been together since last year but there is a line that you don't cross talking to roommates/best friends. I wouldn't text your roommates about meeting up to go out, so don't text mine. They don't want to see you they want to see your friends and feel sorry for you.

You've done everything you made me promise you I wouldn't do, and what's worse is the fact that I still love you. I must be twisted, but you're a liar and a cheater.

If you don't mean it, don't say it. So many people here say things that they just can't keep up with. It's easy to call someone your best friend. It's easy to tell them that you love and care about them. But it is not easy to be there for them when you have your own matters to take care of. It is not easy to actually love and care about them in such place like Cornell where everyday is a struggle to survive. I've been let down by so many people who irresponsibly threw sweet words at me and then turned their backs that I've reached a point where I no longer believe people when they say they actually care about me."

""I'm a senior. It's been a great 4 years - but a part of me wishes I'd spent a little bit more time meeting and befriending """"interesting"""" people. My group of friends is alright - but that shit gets old you know? I've spent the last few months going out of my way to talk to and interact with people I wouldn't have otherwise, but in doing so I realized something about Cornell...

People here SUCK. Seriously.

Politeness here has become so rare that people mistake it for flirtation. Case in point - asking a girl to grab drinks and chill with you, and she thinks you're hitting on her. (The fuck?)

People are NOT very open to meeting others, especially if they don't feel like they're on the same """"level"""" or social scene. This shit works both ways - striking up a convo with the anime club running around uris, and the dudes feel like I'm too """"fratty"""" and ignore me. Try to chat with a dude with a sweet classic camera, the fucker blows me off. These are just two examples, but you get the idea.

On one level, its made me realize how insular the whole campus is. People here really do self-segregate, and as much as Cornell touts how diverse this place is, the quality of the student body could really improve. Not when it comes to """"race"""" or ethnicity, but peoples attitudes. This place is really full of insecure social social climbers with HUGE chips on their shoulders. 

I just want someone new (and interesting) to chill with. Is that too much to ask? I could care less about how your dad just closed this huge deal at some bank dude. Talk to me about life, your aspirations, your feelings - anything but shitty topics that contribute to the vapidness of the people on this campus..."""

The hypocrisy here is hilarious. To all the people (especially girls) giving the guy “trying to get some pussy” a hard time: if it was a girl “trying to get some dick,” would you have been as quick to judge her? Call her a slut? Tell her there’s something wrong with her? Who gives a shit how he expressed himself, crude or not? Whether he wishes he had “someone to be intimate with” or “someone to fuck,” the basic premise is the same, and a sentiment echoed by many, if not most of the people here, male or female. Maybe if you lowered your pious waving finger just a bit, you could see that. He wants to have sex. I want to have sex. You want to have sex. We all want to have sex (most of us, anyway). The fact that he can’t get any has nothing to do with the fact that he wants pussy, because guess what? Most of the guys having sex “want some pussy,” and yet there they are, having sex.

""One thing that has continually been pissing me off and making me incredibly sad at the same time is how women are portrayed in the media and how that affects the self-esteem of me and many other women I know. I see my roommate complaining about how her stomach isn't as flat as so-and-so's or how her arms aren't as toned and someone else. I see the looks from girls at the gym who enviously stare at other girls while silently comparing themselves to everyone else. I see girls on the bus trying to secretly compare themselves to other people, and see their faces fall when a beautiful girl gets on the bus and attracts people's stares.
It makes me so sad that women feel the need to all be stick thin and toned, but not too toned, with long, straight hair and a perfect smile with the perfect clothes and perfect shoes. Everyone is created differently and everyone has bodies that are different, why can't people accept that? Who said that you need to look a specific way to be beautiful? Society? 
Well society is fucked up.
Standing in front of the mirror pinching and pulling at different parts of your body is only going to make you feel worse, and I wish that everyone could see that they are as beautiful as everyone else."

Even if I really, really fucked up.... I've bawled my eyes out for you, it feels like I've gone through hell and back, and at the end of it all I still care about you.

You're still in my heart and in my soul and I know you had some logic and reason behind some of your actions.

""I'm going to be real. What does it take for a guy to get some pussy around here? Or in a relationship? Don't get me wrong, I'm a reasonably attractive guy with good physical features and many girls find me attractive, I mean, check my Tinder ;). I'm stuck with countless hookups who give sub-par BJs and rough tugging HJs (I can honestly do better myself). 

I feel like a good portion of the girls here are fake as fuck and won't give you the time of day unless you're in a certain frat or play a sport (even if they suck bad). You get [their] number and the first text there's no reply, even when you two hit it off perfectly. Like why give away your number if you don't want to talk to me or you half-ass the conversation? You invite them to lunch, dates, etc., to get to know them but then they either find some bullshit excuse, but say they're still into you. Or they flirt with you but ultimately don't reciprocate your energy. WTF? Stop playing games, it's so stupid. 

I try to be as direct as possible with these girls (not women, until I find some worthy of that title), but the other half of them are damaged as fuck from past relationships or are just socially awkward. Many of these girls don't know what they want. You want a date? Sure, I got it. You want to get lunch to get to know each other? Fine. Want me to be romantic, funny, outgoing, involved on campus, strong, and independent? Dig Bick? (bet you read that wrong) Treat you right? Motherfucking check all of that and more!

@2248:  Have a safe word and set boundaries early.  Take it slow, and just ease yourself into it.  The point here is to be safe and enjoy yourselves, and have the kinky sex be stimulating, so understand what you are and are not comfortable doing, communicate that to her, and at the risk of redundancy, HAVE A SAFE WORD.  Finally, give it a shot.  In a safe environment, engaging a fantasy like this could be fun for both parties, and if you find yourself not liking it, then you can always switch back to normal stuff.  Communicate, be open, and have fun!

""Today when I was studying in a conference room on the 7th floor of Olin, a group of four people came in and started to talk. This quite got on my nerves, so I asked them if they used the room for quiet study or group discussion. To my surprise, they said this conference room was for group study, and there were other quiet rooms that I could use, and that others would be joining them soon. Not sure what they said about the conference room was right, I kind of backed down and left a few minutes later. Wanting to make sure, I explained the situation to a librarian at the circulation desk and she said the priority of any study area in the library is for quiet study, not to mention that I had been in the room before they came, and that I could ask them to keep quiet or else leave. She even offered to help me mediate the situation. As I didn't want to make another scene I just kindly turned it down.
Guys, next time if you are annoyed by the incessant talking near you in the study area of libraries (except the cafe area), feel free to hush them. If they don't listen or even claim what they do is OK, ask a librarian for help. They are happy to help you. By the way, that group of people really owe me an apology for misleading me."""

You are loved. 

You are not defined by your accomplishments, your failures, by where you are working next year-next summer, who your parents are, where you're from, by your fears, by your sexual assault, by your regrets, by your illness, by your wealth, by your poverty, your friends, acquaintances, or enemies, by who you've hooked up with, by how many beers you've chugged, by your university, by your research, by your GPA, your admission to grad school, deferral to med-school, the desires of your parents, friends, family and of who they want you to be.

""Hey Cornell,
Like many of you, I've been on far too few legit dates at Cornell. Seriously, I took a girl on a date once sophomore year but she didn't text me back so I figured it wasn't really worth it. Can't say that I've been on any other first dates at Cornell. But, I was thinking about it... and I've also had pretty bad relationships at Cornell (not bad in the sense of hateful or angry, just bland and not that enjoyable). So I figured a change in strategy was in order - but I don't know how one goes about getting set up for a blind date.

So... I decided to put a google form on Cornell Confessions :D. I'm basically going to ask each person who responds on a date. If its nice, maybe we'll go on some more. That's how this whole going on dates thing works right?

I'm a 5'10"""" averge build white male looking for a date with a girl of any skin color, any height. I smoke weed and drink alcohol but its not important to me that you do. I'll be graduating in a few weeks, so I'm no.t looking for anything super legit, just somebody to chill with and have a good time. Personality, I'm an extrovert who finds politics fascinating but otherwise tries to not take himself so seriously

If your response to the above was """"sweet, free food"""" rather than """"yea, a date would be fun,"""" then kindly fuck off :D"

Is being single really *that* scary for people who've been in a relationship for a long time? You're willing to put up with that much perpetual unhappiness, next to someone you have waning interest in, because the thought of being alone seems so much worse? Just a heads up to everyone in a shitty relationship they're too afraid to get out of: this boogeyman you call ""single life"" is not real. You'll eventually learn to sleep without a nightlight and without a space-filler of a significant other next to you in bed. Keep that space open for the person you're meant to be with.

How do you think it feels being dragged around and yet not given my place by your side because you're too afraid of what others think or could possibly do to our relationship or whatever it is that's going on between us? I'd like to know.
In this fear you resort to spending less and less time with me and more and more weekends kissing ass to and going out with your million and one friends, and not to mention, getting drunk and high. 
The few times we have gone out you don't even introduce me to your friends, but you sure wear me on your arm like a brand spanking new watch or something. 

Wow, I feel so stupid. (Feel free to agree)
You expect me to take care of your drunk self tonight? Most likely not this time, buddy.
I've got better things to do-on that ""future"" agenda you dread so much. 
And you have to nerve to ask me why she thought you were an asshole?
There you go. There's your answer.

I hope you take all the things you've told me and shove them up your ass. They're all just a confused menagerie.... 

In the meantime I'll do all the things I've missed out on doing with my best friends for the past few months.  Having the time of my life, dressing up, being sexy like I want to be.

I was drunk and she did not believe that I could be gay. I repeatedly told her i did not want to do anything and she did, she did lots of things that I did not want, including taking my clothes off, making me touch her and having her touch me, she pushed me down on her bed and made me drink more, telling me that ""it would feel great and i secretly wanted it"" .

There is no universal standard or way to measure which category a situation falls in either, it is entirely subjective and then opinions snowball into one direction or the other.

At times I feel the way u people treat me is so unfair. U know when I sit here I begin to think that u guys are just selfish. Later I realize that actually I am the stupid one :). You guys don't even do anything, it's just that I get emotional about every person. Believe me it's a disease. To sit here and care just about everyone is crazy. At times u guys just need someone to fill spaces, so when I come around and see that u are sad and do insane things to make u all happy, u guys don't complain and I just about do everything to make u guys happy. I let go of my ego, self respect and just about everything. Then after a few days when all is ok, u all treat me like the stranger I was. Dear everyone I know no one asked me to do all this. No one asked me to be emotional. I know it's totally my fault that I have no hold on myself. May be I am weak and may be I am stupid. If wish u would all stop doing this. Slowly but surely all of u r killing what's human in me. Eventually I'll lose this feeling and may be then I would have learnt my lessons. Keep up your good work :)"""

I really dislike the way people on this page make hasty generalizations about people based on their race/ethnicity. Not all black people are attracted to the same kind of person, neither are indians, etc. Not all white boys act the same or have the same experiences."
6067,2014-04-26 15:03:22,"2132

I hated you about a month ago for complaining about problems I considered minimal, ignoring me, and (unknowingly) setting off my PTSD. Weirdly enough, the situations that made me so averse to you at the time ended up causing me to reflect on my life, seek help, and start truly recovering from problems that have plagued me for years. Now that this is done, maybe we can start over if you're a better person than I thought you were and you have no negative feelings toward me. Regardless of what ends up happening, you were unwittingly a catalyst for my recovery and the reason I'm becoming myself again. I'm going to have a much more normal, healthy, productive future than I ever envisioned previously."

I'm like, purposely cold and unfriendly to my roommate, moreso than I've ever been to anyone on this campus. This is because the first few weeks after I moved in, she revealed herself as not only whiny, but kind of a bigot.

It's been a hell of a four years. I've suffered through depression, suicide attempts, eating disorders, bipolar disorder, and more. I've spent more time in Gannett than I've spent having a social life or spending time with my friends and sorority. But I've met the love of my life at this school and for that I am grateful."
6071,2014-04-26 15:31:34,"2128

I work hard and get good grades because it's all I really have. I don't have friends or anyone that I feel is particularly close to me. I strive for a certain career, in hopes that it will make me happy. I can't see myself doing anything else. I don't think it will make me happy."
6072,2014-04-26 15:06:35,"2128

I've loved you for years and years, and I've been with you as a supporting friend for most of the ups and downs of your love life so far. The only times I really ache to tell you the truth about myself are when you're having a hard time with your relationships. I know I would treat you better than these other people do. It pains me so much to see you hurting. Every time I come close to confessing, though, the thing that stops me is that I want you to be happy. What if this girl you're with now is really the one for you? What if I tell you my feelings, and they are not shared? I can live with you not caring for me in that way, but I can't live with our friendship broken. The worst thing that could happen to me is that you wouldn't want to remain friends. So, I hope you know that I'll always be at your side, through all the troubles you'll face ahead."

In another few weeks, this dream called Cornell is going to be over and I realize that I should be spending the remaining time hanging out and cherishing the moments with the people I love here than break my head and get stressed about exams and deadlines.

To tell the truth, I have no idea what the fuck I'm doing. I'm running faster than most, but I'm just as clueless about the direction I'm running in. I'm too weak to find the right way, and too cowardly to change tack even if I did. I don't really want or care too much about my accomplishments now, and it would be so easy to give up my pride (probably even arrogance) if I could just be happy."""

""I'm really tired of being the way that I am. I don't want to be like this anymore.

I'm tired of being gay. To me, it's just not worth it; it sucks! I'm never happy with life because of this, and it's ruined my life for about six years! How so? Back at home, I told a couple of my friends about my homosexual desires and stuff that's happened in middle school. But here at Cornell, I have yet to tell anyone. It's not because I'm afraid of a ruined friendship (everyone at Cornell is generally accepting either way, they should be) I just don't feel it's worth it to tell anyone about my problem. I just don't want to be gay. 

It's painful walking across campus and seeing really attractive guys that I know for sure are straight, they're just so manly (this isn't always the case, but generally is). It hurts to know that I can never have a relationship with them, only see them from afar as class is dismissed and just stare in awe at them (not creepily). Why do these guys have to be so cute? Ugh, I feel like I'm attracted to more guys on a daily basis than a straight male is attracted to girls on a daily basis (assuming he's single). Yeah, it sucks, and my parents won't be too fond of my decision if I come out. I know they won't reject me, they just don't support that behavior. 

When I was caught doing stuff with another guy in middle school, my parents where shocked and my mother was crying. She said her worst fear/nightmare came true, and that was her son being gay. I agree with my parents because if I go the complete gay route and hook up with a guy, I will never have the opportunity to biologically form a child of my own. I don't want to adopt a kid just because my sexuality won't allow me to biologically form one. I want a beautiful wife whom I can have children with. I think that's one of the most beautiful aspects of humanity: a guy finds his girl and they fall in love and have children that resemble each other. But I can't do that with a guy, unfortunately.

It's just a horrible situation to be in. It's not about coming out, it's about the frustration surrounding the fact that all the guys I see on campus are just going to mentally torment me as I remain forever alone. I'm also not looking for a LGBT community because I don't feel like I identify with them. I just don't want to be gay anymore, it has ruined me. 

I just want to be HAPPY and TRULY in love with a girl someday and not have to worry about anything else, just her and our children--our family, and life itself. 

Until then, I guess I'll start looking for a friend to confide in. I just have no idea what to do, I've tried forever and failed. Sigh.."""

I like how other top tier schools consider themselves on par with the ivies, desperately want to be included in the ivy league, but vehemently deny this fact to show that they are special.

I've been telling friends and my psychiatrist that I'll get help if I'm ever suicidal, but it's mostly just wishful thinking. My bluntness about suicide scares me sometimes, but I've long since come to terms with the fact that I'm going to die someday. My apologies to my loved ones."

Although I was not able to actually pledge a fraternity because my parents felt that my grades were inadequate, they've realized now that they won't be getting much better. They finally understand the rigor here and so I'll probably be rushing next year. What I hate most is that living the geed life has taught me that it's much harder to make friends second semester because a lot of people are extremely judgemental. All I want to do here is do well, make long lasting friends and maybe meet a cute girl along the way. Hopefully next year will be better."

I've just been diagnosed with an incurable disease. Out of the blue my life is turned on it's head and pretty soon it will be stopped permanently. From what I've been told, I will die. There is no hope. Every dream I've had of the life I wanted to live is gone. I'll be lucky if I make it to graduation in a few years. I'm not telling you this so you can feel sorry for me. I've done enough crying. I want to remind each and every one of you to not forget to live your life. Skip class. Leave the country. Hookup with that girl you think is out of your league. Do something reckless and stupid. Love the people around you. If I knew I was going to die before I turned 20 I would not have spent so much time doing nothing. If you're reading this right now, do me a favor: Get off Facebook. Pick up the phone and call the people you love. Remind them that they mean something to you. After that, go hangout with your friends. If you don't have any friends, go make some. Live in the moment and appreciate the future you have. Live like you have one because it's not guaranteed."

Either way, I'm probably never going to muster the courage to approach him..."""

Life doesn't come easy for anyone, I know that. I like to think I embrace happiness when it happens in my life, and I like to think I usually try to alleviate painful situations. But just right now I feel so alone and gosh sobbing is so much worse than crying! I don't mean this in a self-pitying or pity-partying way, I really do mean to complain that sobbing makes me feel physical discomfort because I can't catch my breath! I'm grateful and aware that I'm just sad right now though, and it's not like I'm depressed or anything. We all get sad. I am sad tonight. I was sad yesterday. ""Fake"" the happy till you make it works sometimes, and I think I will be doing that however much I can. :)"

Nowhere else will you see anything like the out-of-this-world vista that is the view from the balcony of Willard Straight hall -- having lunch will never feel the same. Nature + the best of human ingenuity = this campus. I will sleep with my Cornell sweatshirt for the rest of my life, this will always be home, the place where I found a sense of belonging.

I'm really sorry if I've come off as flaky lately. Don't believe for a second it's you, it's 100% me and the fact that I don't have my shit together and have no idea how to reach out about not having my shit together.

I'm honestly not sure who I can rely on and I'm not sure if I've tried with the wrong people or if I've just gone about it the wrong way with the few people I have opened up to.

Am I the only person who still sticks to 1920's standards for dating? How's this for a date: I pick you up at your apartment and we go see a local play or maybe an art gallery. Afterwards we go a mellow coffee shop for post-show cappuccinos and talk about anything that comes mind. If things are going well, we can take the scenic route back to your apartment. I make sure you arrive safely at your door and if I'm lucky I can get a quick kiss on the check. Nothing more. If you're not too freaked out by the whole exchange, maybe we can go on another."

Housing on campus is so stilted in favor of West Campus it's ridiculous. Not only do they get such close placement to campus, but also all those dining halls and essentially free meals. As one of those people who is stuck in Schuyler by a time slot, I find that system to be ridiculous. There should be a different method than random selection, something based on GPA, the most important number and the fairest way to compare all students. If you want to live in a better place, then you have to work to get that place. 

[The meal plan? Mandatory unlimited meals. That's around 5k a semester. That's far from free to me]"

""Some of the things you said on Friday were very hurtful. You probably don't know, or care, that I was having a very shitty day and the only reason I even went out was because my therapist told me to. You also don't know how I cried all the way home, how I sat on the floor of my room contemplating suicide, or at the very least doing some serious damage to my body. You don't know that I continued to cry the next day as I told a friend what had happened. I cried until my eyes were swollen and no more tears would come out.

I am so sorry that you are so unhappy and that the only way you can feel good is by hurting me. I am sorry you have no real friends, that you can't make a real connection with anyone because you're a selfish person. I am sorry that you are so miserable that you don't care about other people's feelings.

Most of all though, I am sorry that I let a bitch like you get to me. I should have realized early on that you weren't my friend, that to you friends are objects you can use to benefit yourself. I'm not surprised your boyfriend wants to leave, he deserves someone who appreciates all the love he has to give. You act like all you need in life is money, and that it's the only thing that matters, but newsflash sweetie, you can't buy friends or love with money.

I am glad I stopped talking to you, you are a toxic person. I can't wait until the end of the semester when you leave, I hope I never see you again, and I hope you choose to move out of the apartment. I can't stand seeing you every day. """

Can I just say that I find the housing system on this campus absolutely appalling? Not only is the layout of this campus awful, extremely spread out, and hilly, this goddamn school only guarantees housing for two years. How is it that in a place that has as much land as Cornell does, they can only guarantee housing for two years. It would make them so much fucking money to build dorms instead of closing down East Avenue FOR A YEAR to build a glass atrium in one of the most beautiful Gothic parts of campus. Do we actually need another cafe and some more offices in Goldwyn Smith? Instead, build a few more dorms, and stop making the housing process so fucking miserable for everyone who gets a bad time slot. I have no fucking idea who decides how money is allocated but I'm pretty sure whoever is in charge is an absolute idiot with no concern for the well-being of students. We already go to school at one of the most stressful places on Earth. Could Cornell not make this ONE thing just a bit easier to handle?"

To those that are depressed at Cornell, 
Know that there is help. Life sadly will not always be fair, easy, or even enjoyable. As a student who has suffered from depression for many years, I have only just recently started taking medications for it. Despite early reluctance to get on a medication, I don't regret it. Medication in combination with proactive therapy has been a life saver. Things still aren't perfect, nor will they ever be, but I'm learning to take control of the things in life that I used to feel helpless about. Seek help. There's no shame in going to/calling EARS, going to CAPS, or seeking help elsewhere. I now respect myself knowing that I have put in a lot of hard work to get to the more mentally stable position that I am at now. You're not alone. I hope those that profess their depression on here are willing to reach out when push comes to shove. I love you all."

The thing is, I'm over being mad at you. I'm just quietly counting down the days until I'm back on a flight to California, and you're off to whatever expensive vacation your parents are paying for. And I pity you. Because, the way I see it, there are two possibilities as to why you are such a negative person. The first is that you are incapable of seeing the good in anything and are so focused on what you perceive to be wrong with the world that you can't see anything half decent about it. That's a pretty shitty way to be, but one day you might get over that. The second thing is worse, in my opinion. It's that you derive happiness from all the vitriol you spew at everyone. Happiness at the expense of hating everyone else in the world? Now that's screwed up.

""On tuesday this past week, I woke up and couldn't think of a reason to start my day. I missed my morning classes, I had a bunch of papers due, and had errands to do for orgs, but I couldn't think of a good enough reason to get started on anything in particular. This is how most of my mornings this semester have gone, and I'd almost given up doing anything about it. That is, until that tuesday afternoon, when my stomach started growling after lying in bed for hours and I couldn't even find a compelling reason to eat. Suddenly the thought came to me: """"Because I want to live, don't I??"""" Once that crossed my mind, I threw myself out of bed, forced myself to eat breakfast, and took myself to Let's Talk.

Depression's a really scary, insidious thing that can pervade your thought processes in ways you don't even realize. It took hitting my own proverbial rock bottom to seek help, but I know many are not so lucky. If you find yourself feeling like less than yourself, feeling lost and purposeless, and not enjoying or not motivated to do things you love, don't ignore it. Don't wait until it's too late to do something about it, because pulling yourself out of that headspace is no easy feat.

For any of you who feel like they're past the point of no return, with little will to live or conscious/unconscious thoughts of suicide, don't give up no matter how hard it feels. You're not broken, and you don't have to feel as awful as you do right now. I'm not out of the woods yet, but I have hope again that I'll pull myself out. A quote I've found really helpful lately is, """"You'll never find the life you want if you refuse to live the life you got."""""""

I end up crying often now thinking about how I left you because we were too difficult for me to do, so I chose something easier.  And easier is still good and fun, but it's turning bitter in my mouth as I realize how easy is cheap and isn't going to last, where as you and I could have made it.  We would have gotten married in a few years, had a calm and sweet life and maybe even a kid or two.  Now that I've had almost a year to think about it, I realize the mistake I've made, and now it's too late.  I can never tell you this, because I'm sure you'll end up with the girl you're with now.  I know you're happy, and I don't want to ruin that or make it any harder for you.  I don't want to hurt the guy I'm with now.  I just wish I didn't have to feel like this all the time.  I guess I'll just have to live with this regret.

My boyfriend raped me when I was 15. A few months later, I was sexually assaulted in the basement of my school and no one would believe me. I don't say this as a pity party. I have healed. It wasn't easy and it still hurts sometimes and has caused many problems for me in my private life, but I have healed.  That being said, I don't believe that it is right to deprive those accused of rape or sexual assault the right to an attorney. If anything, that is what delegitimizes our experiences and our struggles. It's as though we're saying that either we don't have enough proof to get them convicted (which will simply invite claims of false accusation even when a crime was actually committed) or that our struggles put us ""above"" the law in some way. Everyone who supports depriving them of their right to an attorney screams and begs for equality. How is it equality when they are not even given their basic rights? How would you feel if you were accused of robbing a house and weren't given the right to an attorney? Even if you committed the crime it would suck. Murderers are even given the right to an attorney. Yes rape is an absolutely horrific thing to experience, but you have the opportunity to heal and live and help others do the same. Those who do commit the crime deserve punishment because they have caused extreme pain and suffering for someone, but EVERYONE deserves equal protection under the law. After all, isn't that what we're fighting for?"

I am not suicidal and I don't wish to kill myself. It's just that sometimes I don't want to live anymore. I guess the burden my death would put on my parents and fear of death itself stops me.

""To the people who posted #1458, #1473 and #1486: There's so much hate here I'm feeling hesitant about sharing my story. I feel like all points in the three posts are valid, although everyone seems to be responding to their own experiences so they are probably getting angry at each other for no good reason. So I want to offer my story, which is a situation where all three posts apply. I guess a large part of me agreed with #1473 and so I felt surprised when #1486 posted such a strong response. I felt like collateral damage when #1486 indirectly attacked me. I just want to offer a different point of view, and point out that things are much more complicated than it seems. Hopefully this post helps other people know that it is important to be a good friend, but it is also as important to be good to yourself too by knowing when to call it quits.

So, here's my story. I have this friend who went through a lot with me in freshman year, so we share the same tragedy, loss and emotional baggage. We both had help from EARS and Gannett for the same reasons at around the same time, and so we are (were?) close. But then I got better much faster than she did, most likely because I was really fortunate to have found a great support system in sophomore year. She, however, started drinking massive amounts of alcohol, doing some recreational drugs, and hooking up with random people almost every night. I don't judge her for doing any of those, but I was only worried because after doing those she would completely forget everything that happened and go into a panic attack.

At first, it started off gradual and didn't seem like too big a problem, because she will always promise that it was a one time thing. I tried my best to help her, and so did our sorority sisters. We would sit with her and dry her tears till she passed out in bed, we would force her to go to Gannett, and we would drop everything we were doing to get to her side when she called. Her boyfriend was a horrible influence and when he really screwed her over, we tried our best to compensate her relationship problems with more sisterly love on our end. To be honest, it was inconvenient sometimes but I never resented that. This lasted for a year or so but I would always be there. Finally, her drinking and other coping mechanisms moderated out and for a moment, we were all glad. Personally, I had a much smoother year, occasionally breaking down because of academic stress or resurfacing PTSD about once a semester. She was there for me too, for which I was grateful. It seemed like our friendship was headed towards a great direction after all the things we have been through in the past two years.

But after she and her boyfriend ended, she started picking on my """"survivor's guilt"""". It started off as small insults that we would laugh off, such as being a """"nerd"""" that cared more about studying than most people do. But after a while, the insults escalated in frequency and intensity and I realized they were not meaningless jokes. Whenever she got drunk and upset, I was still the first person to be there for her to talk to her. But she would verbally and emotionally abuse me for having """"moved on okay"""" after the tragedy we both experienced in freshman year, and that I would never understand because I'm okay now. She would say that I only tried to help her because it made me feel better about myself. She pushed me away, sometimes physically.

She would call me names and when she sobered up she would apologize and blame it on the alcohol and act as if nothing happened. She would then repeat this cycle again. I bottled up that guilt and hurt like nothing was wrong, and cried myself to sleep thinking about the nasty things she would say to me. I didn't want to confront her or cry in front of her because I knew she had enough on her plate and to be honest, the survivor's guilt was getting to me. I felt like I had no right to burden her.

But my therapist told me that it would be best if we would both give each other some distance, for  the sake of both our mental healths. I did so by signing up for more clubs on campus, getting more busy and finally meeting more people, but I always tried to be there for her when I could, until one day she said things that I don't think I can ever forgive her truly. Again, she apologized when she was sober and pretended nothing happened. When she realized that I was still upset about what she said, she wanted to stop being friends with me, went behind my back to my other sorority sisters and told them similar words of confession #1458: """"When I want to talk to you, you seem annoyed. To be honest it seems like I'm always there for you, but you're never there for me."""" 

Was I really never there for her? I don't think anyone who was involved in the friendship could honestly say that. But why would she say that? Maybe to gain sympathy or just take it out on me. Honestly, I don't know. But that brings us to confession #1473, because as much as I feel sorry that I cannot be there for her anymore, I think she has failed to ask herself what she has done to push me away. I want to be a great friend and be there for her, but not when doing so gives her the power to break down the emotional and mental wellbeing I have worked so hard with Gannett to build up. I love her, but I have to love myself too. 

And lastly, if confession #1486 sees this, I hope you don't think I'm an entitled asshole just because I agree with #1473. I really tried my best, and I wish my friend and you can understand that it was so easy for someone to be accused of """"never"""" being there when in fact, being friends with her, taking care of her and living in the survivor's guilt she imposed on me, took up so much of my own college life. I hope you understand that I have to move on. I'm in a good place now where I don't really have much """"shit"""" (in #1486's words) to deal with, so forgive me if I'm happier now, forgive me if I don't want to live in survivor's guilt, and that's all I ever wanted for her as well. I'm appalled that #1486 would ever wish the worst upon anyone when you don't know the stories of people following this confession page, and I really hope you don't ever do that again because you never know who you accidentally hurt.

And to everyone else, if you read till here, I'm sorry I had to get everything off of my chest, and hopefully this helps anyone who is having personal or friendship problems by letting you realize that it is important to always love yourself. Gannett really helped me through my struggles, and hopefully you will let them help you too."

Recently there's been a lot of fuss over the Student Assembly's refusal to vote on Cornell's investment in Israeli corporations.  I personally think the whole idea is stupid.  Everyone forgets that Cornell is not an individual person, but rather a conglomeration of diverse people.  The Student Assembly's decision to avoid voting in favor of either side was the only reasonable option, the only choice that represented the idea of Cornell as a group of people.  There Cornell students that fall on both sides of the Palestine-Israeli conflict, and I for one appreciate that the Student Assembly recognized that."

""The people expressing outrage at Julius's column here (http://cornellsun.com/blog/2014/04/18/letter-to-the-editor-the-danger-of-rape-culture-denial/) are extraordinarily misguided. Perhaps the only thing they got right was that 1 in 4 is a better guess than 1 in 40. But most data puts it closer to 1 in 8.

I know multiple people who are on the judicial board. I hear them complain constantly about other members of the board not taking cases seriously. I was speaking to a close friend who's been on dozens of sexual assault cases. The vast vast majority of rape cases result in suspensions or explusions (contrary to the claims of the article).

But that doesn't make me furious at all. What makes me furious is that my friend knows multiple people who were falsely convicted by the panel. He voted no; others voted yes. He paid attention; other texted, ignored facts, and went on long rants about how bad rape was without actually examining the question """"did this specific person commit rape?"""" He speaks particularly hatefully of one girl who he's been on several sexual assault cases with. On two of those cases, the accused was acquitted 4-1, because neither he nor the other student nor the staff member nor the faculty member on the board thought he did it. But this girl has never voted to aquit somebody of a sexual assault charge. Facts don't matter.

The process is more fucked than that. The JA is the attorney for both the accused and the victim. She's responsible for defending the accused if the accused is innocent and prosecuting the accused if the accused is guilty. Who gets to decide which role she should be playing? She does, of course. Sound fair? Not to me.

The process is more fucked than that. The students on the judicial board are essentially chosen by the JA.

How do I know? I was falsely accused of rape. I took a settlement and was suspended from Cornell for two years because I was scared to death. I was scared of crazy people on the panel who have never voted to aquit a single student. I was scared of a system where I can't face my accuser. I was scared of a JA who told me her job was to help me and then told me two weeks later that she wasn't going to help me and her job was to hurt me. I'm scared of a standard of proof that says """"if its more likely than not that you did this, we'll expell you.""""

The Cornell judicial process is INSANELY broken. But what scares me most is the attitude of my fellow students. """"Due process"""" is supposed to ensure that the outcomes are fair - it's not some loophole that rapists jump through. Watch carefully while you throw it out the window and hope that you're never on the receiving end of a false accusation."""

I can't stand the way we glorify the Willard Straight Hall takeover. They came in with guns and threatened to kill people who didn't leave the building. Would you support an ""oppressed"" group doing that today while you're eating in the Ivy Room or getting counseling at EARS? Imagine if you were crying your heart out from depression and a group of students opened the door  holding shotguns and they told you to leave the building. Is this really the sort of behavior we support?"

Not being able to connect with anyone on a deeper personal level just makes me feel shitty at times. And the more I think about it, the more shitty I feel.

""Went with my gut and stopped by CAPS the other day. I just needed to talk to someone. It turns out the reason that I've been feeling so shitty and emotionless and unfocused and just miserable all the time was because I've been suffering from moderate depression for the last eight or nine years, but I've just been unconsciously repressing it. Walking out of those doors was the happiest that I've felt in a long time. I just wish I had ignored my parents sooner and sought out counseling when they insisted that I didn't need it. I wish I wasn't graduating in a few weeks, because I know that life would've been completely different.

If you're feeling down at this school, stop by CAPS. Talk to someone. You don't have to tell anyone. It turned the tide in my battle against depression, and I would have eventually killed myself if I hadn't had that talk. This is a mild case compared to some of the things that make people depressed here, but I'm confident that talking to someone is worth a shot."""

""Does anyone else actually support not having free bus passes for first-year students? I mean, I wouldn't be surprised if the increase in ridership that TCAT finds so troubling is predominantly from freshmen taking the bus to Uris because they're too lazy to walk the 10 minutes it takes to get to class. I think the 6pm and weekends policy is completely fine for encouraging freshmen to get to know the campus and surrounding area - and if you really need the bus pass, you should be willing to pay for the convenience (or make financial aid cover it if you can prove that). If you break your ankle, or have a class at the vet school one semester, or can only go to the mall at this one particular time during the day and desperately need food, or absolutely despise walking, just pay for single rides or get yourself the bus pass. I don't see the problem.

It would also be nice for the bus to not be too full (mainly because of freshmen taking advantage of it to get to the arts quad) to even stop anywhere after the first RPCC/Appel stops, so that I could actually make use of the bus privileges I specifically paid for to streamline the process of getting to work, near the vet school. Which, unlike Uris, is a bus-worthy walk away.

You have legs, and this is Cornell; you knew you'd have to use them, so suck it up and do so.

Some times I look around and I see all the people smiling and their beauty is overwhelming, all in their own little worlds. What would it be like to share a personal world with someone? This isn't an idle fantasy, nor a complaint of loneliness. This is a contemplation of the trust, moments and sunlight that could be shared with you, special person. My heart actually aches. Twinges at the thought of cutting a hole in the wall of your world and looking in, becoming entrapped in the dew-covered web of your life. It's with an animalistic jealousy that I watch you smile. But my world is invisible to yours, so all you'll see if you spot that hole in the sky is a warm glow of friendship. Best try shooting an arrow."

""I never do this, but I feel like I have something to offer, so here goes. This is a long one, but I beg you to read it if it relates to you.

IF YOU BELIEVE YOU ARE DEPRESSED (ACTUALLY CLINICALLY), I.E. YOU DON'T WANT TO LIVE ANYMORE, LIFE IS A STRUGGLE, ETC., DON'T WAIT AROUND AND PRETEND THAT YOU'RE OKAY; SEEK TREATMENT. Damn, I don't know how many times I need to remind myself that I was so dumb for not seeking treatment immediately.

Depression is a real illness that ultimately manifests itself as severe feelings of emptiness that you cannot escape. Whatever the reasons that spur depression, depression becomes this irrational, out-of-control sense of sadness that you cannot overcome on your own. The depression then self-perpetuates and can come in swings (depressive episodes) but will ultimately come up and infect you. When it becomes irrational, seek treatment immediately.

Damn it, my freshman year I suffered from depressive episodes every now and then. I pretended I'd be okay. Then, it got to such a point where every day (EVERY FUCKIN' DAY) felt like a nightmare. I felt sick, tired, near tears--and for no reason whatsoever. I had friends, family who cared, academic and extracurricular success, and felt self-fulfilled, yet I still felt this empty pit in my stomach and my head. I would look around at other people and feel like a total zombie, like I had nothing in common with anybody around me, when so clearly I had so many friends. (Depression is indeed a self-perpetuating disease.) I realized that I couldn't do it on my own, so I sought treatment.

The treatment saved my life. Really. I look at life as I used to before the depression, with the same high spirits that I always had and a ready-for-action outlook on life. Random sadness brought me down and perpetuated itself, but I got the help that I need, and I can say that I'm better now, immensely happier and more self-fulfilled, with no more headaches and feelings of emptiness.

Do I have to say it again?!? God damn it, if you even CONSIDER walking over to a bridge, I will find you, and I will kill you myself. Don't go through what I went through. Get the help that you need. Go to Gannett and have an intake, get a referral and a list of providers in the area, and see that provider. Openly tell your friends that you're depressed. If you think that you don't have any friends (which is WRONG!), tell your goddamn fuckin' parents. If you don't know what to do, then comment on this post, and I will offer you advice! You're not alone and will never be! People do love you and care for you! God damn it, I swear if I see you on a bridge, I will...

Would anybody mind if I started sitting with people who are eating alone at dining halls (unless they have headphones in or are studying etc.)? Not out of pity. I eat almost every meal alone and have done so for the past three years here. It would be awesome to meet new people and have someone to talk to, even if it's just smalltalk for a short period of time."

I approach my TAs for help when they're at their weakest, when they are most visibly stressed, when they are overwhelmed and tired and just want to get away from their students and go to sleep. That way they always give me answers without bothering with explanations or trying to walk me through anything.

Thank you TAs. I really do love you."

The only reason I study in the library is because whenever I'm in my room I always end up masturbating, falling asleep, and then masturbating again. I've only done this a handful of times in the library."

This school year has been the worst of my life. Coping with family loss, an abusive relationship, and not doing well in school has been so overwhelming. I have been thinking about suicide non-stop and I don't have the energy or desire to ask for help."
6479,2014-04-15 16:47:11,"1459

You were a part of me, 
Now long forgotten.
The things we did
reduced to hollow images and 
strange feelings.
And even if I try to remember, 
My body no longer knows your touch.
Affection has been abandoned
like an orange peel, 
Sticky and bitter.
Now all that remains is the pain.
A vague memory of tears and
loud noises, naked on the floor.
You talk of friendship and civility, 
But all I want is for you to be a stranger again.
One who in passing I will not recognize."
6480,2014-04-15 16:29:13,"1458

The other day, you told me how close you thought we were. But are we really? When I want to talk to you, you seem annoyed. To be honest it seems like I'm always there for you, but you're never there for me."

Ever since I came to Cornell, not one single day has gone by where I haven't been reminded of the pain and suffering this place causes me. It never ends. The problems that I, along with many of the other students here, am encountering could easily be fixed if the administration just put in the smallest, most marginal amount of extra effort and attention. Please, Cornell, stop being assholes and start buying better toilet paper."

Cornell is really a great place"

""It doesn't matter what you believe about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict or about the suggestion that Cornell should divest in certain companies. As a college student, this is the time to be an activist, the time to be interested and invested in political issues. Everyone should be outraged that the Student Assembly refused to let students speak out about their beliefs. Instead, most students I've talked to have no idea what's going on in the student government. 
http://cornellsun.com/blog/2014/04/14/castle-why-i-walked-out/

This is what has disappointed me most since coming to Cornell. Very few students care about politics, or feel the urge to protest issues on campus, or know where they stand on major political debates. Only a couple of my friends even voted in elections last year. I'm afraid that our generation will be remembered only for its apathy."

If I could go back in time, I would go back to when I was 18 and BEAT THE LIVING CRAP OUT OF ME. Then I'd do it again the next day and the next until I started doing things right. Those of you who are undergrads - don't waste your early 20s. I know it's hard when you're that young to really see cause and effect patterns, but trust me -- to say this is the most important time of your lives is a HUGE understatement. Don't waste it!!! For the sake of the rest of us, make the best of it PLEASE!"
6552,2014-04-12 13:52:35,"1387

So much pain. I can't get over you and I can never have you. It's so hard to imagine ever meeting anyone I will like more than you. And that's completely irrational. I'm in love with an idea of you. I just can't let you go. I wish I'd never met you. I'm so tired of years and years of unrequited love. Human beings aren't supposed to live this way. I'm pretty sure if natural selection was still at work, people like me would be selected out for my own benefit and that of the species. Instead we are all just sitting on this planet and suffering needlessly. Cause a bunch of molecules came together 4 billion years ago and here we are... For what."

Here goes. I really like you. I know I don't show it, it is not easy for me to wear my heart on my sleeve. I'm not trying to play hard-to-get, that shit sucks, I just cannot read you. I hope something happens before I graduate, which is, frighteningly, right around the corner. It saddens me to think that there may be mutual interest that goes undeveloped (especially when I honestly, rarely crush). It's a waste to connect with someone and then have that bond ripped away simply because of circumstances."
6560,2014-04-12 13:12:46,"1379

I'm done waiting for you to do something. I overanalyzed everything because I wanted to believe that you really did like me. After spending hours talking to my crying friend about her awful boyfriend, I  realized that you act just like him. I deserve better than that, and I finally feel like I can forget about you and stop being so stupid."

But yesterday I had a dream that I slept with a guy that you're friends with and now I can't tell if I'm attracted to your friend (who is actually pretty cute and nice) or if my dream self wanted to make you jealous."

We were in the same class last semester. He was always really sweet and nice to me, going extra lengths to help me out in class. I added him on Facebook to keep in touch once classes were over, but he still haven't accepted my friend request. We have mutual friends and I know he has been online. I just don't understand. It's not like I have feelings for him or anything. Is it that weird to want to be friends?"

So I get hooking up is fun and people do it all the time in college. I've done it before and don't regret it, and I don't hold anything against people who do hook up regularly. However, I absolutely hate it when guys who have a lengthy sexual history justify their behavior by using an evolutionary argument, like by comparing themselves to animals who aim to copulate with multiple mates to produce the best offspring. I've seen this happen multiple times recently and I can't believe people are actually considering it legitimately. You just equated yourself to an uncivilized animal. And I can only hope that doesn't mean you don't treat your sexual partners with the respect that humans are capable of and should be demonstrating. If that's how you choose to view yourself then to each his own, but I like to think that as humans we're more advanced than wild creatures who go around banging each other freely. Yes sex is natural, yes it's enjoyable, and there are definitely parallels between animal and human relations. But you can't compare animal sex to human sex. We're not uncivilized animals who use it primarily as a means of survival. If you like casual sex, then just own up to it (nothing wrong with being sexually liberated!) instead of feeling the need to justify it with some bs argument, which, btw, you're using within the context of an institution of higher education. Just my two cents."
6578,2014-04-11 16:19:25,"1361

My motivation and my interest in classes have dropped like rocks recently. I don't know how I'll plan on telling my parents that I'm not cut out for grad school... or better yet how I'll even finish out this semester. Growing up sucks."

I honestly hate all the people who feel the need to advertise their events or sublet their apartments on group pages like Overheard at Cornell. I go on that page to be entertained, not to help you find the jacket you lost at Level B, find out more information about your a cappella group, or rent out your apartment."
6582,2014-04-11 16:39:35,"1357

Here's my confession: I look around this campus and I realize just how lonely I am. I have an inadequate personality and I'm not charming, funny, or even close to appealing compared to many other guys (and I guess I can be a bit annoying) and it's difficult for me to establish good friendships with other people. I've told myself almost everyday that this is just how it is and I've accepted it, but I can't embrace it because it still depresses me to know that I can never have the types of friendships and relationships other have. I just want a sense of peace or belonging and I'm not sure how to get there."

Why are girls always being called out on sleeping with guys, being shallow, or not good enough? I have yet to meet many guys with the same qualities. Yet no one questions this. Maybe girls wouldn't feel insecure or be advised to play games when what seems like a majority of guys aren't interested in a relationship. Guys and girls alike, if you're interested in someone DO SOMETHING about it. Don't wait 3 days, or wait 3 hours to text back. Take control of your life and be genuine. In saddens me when I see people tearing and ripping ""types"" of people on here.. maybe the people you're meeting are the ones you are attracting.. maybe not.. but at least try and look for the good in people - maybe you'll surprise yourself."

Here's a confession:
somehow I'm afraid of weekends. Yeah it sounds like I'm crazy, but I just get really depressed when other people are going out and I'm staying in (either because of other commitments, simply too tired, or depressed about not being able to find a girl etc). 
I rarely get enough sleep on weekends either, since I'm so busy. 
Then lastly it's the fear and jealousy that the girl I really really liked might be hooking up with someone right now (she's gorgeous). 
There's nothing to look forward to for weekends."

If she had told you 9 months ago that she cheated three times, my guess is that you would have (rightfully) broken up with her. Shouldn't lying about it for almost a year make it worse, not better?

Seriously, if it was once and she admitted to it immediately, then maybe you could work on rebuilding things (though I wouldn't). In this case, it was multiple cases and compounded by even more untrustworthiness.

It would take years just to get back to the same level of trust as you would have with someone new after a month. Move on."

I honestly think Cornell should have a dating site/matchmaking sight. Reading these confessions and through my own experiences, I see that there are so many missed connections here on campus. People say that all the guys/girls are the same but that's because they haven't had the opportunity to meet someone who is different to them. I may be a hopeless romantic, but I feel like everyone has a match (whether it's on this campus or not) and more matches could be made or chances at love could be had with a legit Cornell dating site with no stigma attached, something less dirty than Tinder for people who are actually looking for something more (and it seems like a lot of us are)."

There's a friend of mine who is obsessed with losing weight...I used to find her very attractive, and she doesn't know that everyone thinks she looks like a child now especially since she's petite and not very tall. Boys love curves, not sticks! It's nice when girls have toned but curvy bodies. Why do girls find that difficult to understand? I'm sorry, but I hope you realize that everyone is commenting on this now, and everyone finds it annoying and disturbing..We don't like eating with you anymore, and it makes people believe you have serious self-esteem issues. Please deal with it, because at one point your friends will all leave because of this as it makes them feel uncomfortable themselves."

 I know I am generalizing a bit but more often then not, these observations hold true. The undergrad girls at Cornell are different and that's not a good thing. I've been fortunate enough to meet, date and become friends with girls from many schools (including ones as diverse as Yale, Chicago, Oregon, etc and etc). Compared to them, the girls here tend to be more stuck-up, snobbish, and materialistic. I don't know what it is about Cornell but so many people have a chip on their shoulder.

I wish girls weren't advised to play games with guys. (Guys wonder why girls play games? It's because we're fucking told to) I repeatedly hear, ""Don't make it too easy for him,"" ""Don't text him first,"" ""Don't be too forward he'll think you're a slut."" What kind of a fucking world do we live in where I have to treat a guy like he's a mindless animal that need to be trained properly and lured in properly in order to catch him? No, I refuse to be a part of this. I'm sorry girls but I think your advice is stupid. I don't want to be with a guy who won't date me because I'm too forward or I express too much interest in him. I don't want to date some ignorant asshole who slut shames. I don't want to have to strategically deny sex to a guy that I like just because I'm told that if I let him have it too early he'll lose interest. Honestly, if these are the kinds of tactics girls believe they need to use to get guys, are you people even mature enough to have serious relationships? Relationships aren't about games, they're not about who texts first, they not about all of those petty things that feed your gossip circles. Relationships are about compassion, trust, good companionship, and feeling a connection with someone. If you're actually deeply compatible with a guy, you both will realize it soon enough. You won't need to worry about your texting schemes and how long you're going to wait to have sex, because if it's a real connection none of those things fucking matter."

It would be nice to have someone that I could take out on dates. But after hooking up, that's all that's left to do. Hook up, and then we drift apart. I want more than that. But...I can't find her.

This may sound weird, but I don't really mind when guys come relatively quickly during sex or a blowjob. I've been with several guys who pride themselves on lasting a really long time, and ok good for you, but guess what? That means you get to come once during the night. Cuz like hell am I going down on you any longer after it took hella long the first go round. And fun fact boys: sex is definitely enjoyable for girls, but most don't come from sex alone, so an hour of straight up fucking isn't really gonna cut it, at least not for me. Don't get me wrong, if it takes like 60 seconds for you to come, that's a little too quick. But even if that happens, I totally don't hold it against the guy. If he's at least able to last longer some of the time, I'm happy. And lasting longer does not mean like a half hour -- at least for me, any longer and I'm bored. Eat me out already, lol. The guy I'm with comes pretty quick usually -- lasts a perfect amount of time for sex, and is really really quick with bjs, as in about 15 seconds haha, which is absolutely awesome for me. So boys, don't always feel embarrassed about coming quickly. Make sure she's pleased too and she shouldn't have a damn thing to complain about! :)"

Movies need to STOP perpetuating the idea that guys who are persistent and try to get the girl regardless of anything, including her clearly showing she is not interested, is not only a good thing, but something that is generally rewarded and results in a romantic relationship. NO -- in the real world that's called stalking and in 90% of the time if you did what guys do in those movies you will get in trouble, probably freak her out and make her feel uncomfortable. I feel like all of those movies are made by middle aged ugly Hollywood directors who are living out their fantasies or justifying creepy things they/men do - same reason why you see relationships where the guy is like 15 years older and considerably uglier than the girl. For the record, I'm a guy. I just hate how brazenly false the image of romance portrayed in popular culture is. I am getting my heart broken from unrequited love and your stupid songs and movies are not helping at all."

1) Every time I see you, I just tremble in the hopes of being able to hold your hands again. But that's never gonna happen again, I know. 

2) You never had any interest in me. Basically, you only led me on just so, for the first time, you could know what it felt like to be in complete control of another vulnerable human being. WOW. Go fuck yourself. 

You can take that friendship and stick it up your perfect ass."
6682,2014-04-08 03:52:50,"1256

I will never be good enough for you. You only text me when you've broken up with your girlfriend or you're fighting. I just fill your voids. I'm never going to be your number one choice, only second best. I wish there was someone better for me, but you always have been my number one."
6683,2014-04-08 03:39:52,"1255

You might consider that maybe I'm just not attracted to you, you need to start taking care of yourself because even though personality does go a long way I'm not going to be proud to date a hypocrite who completely denies that looks don't matter while she judges everyone else and doesn't even take time to look in the mirror. I like the confident way my girlfriend treats herself when she puts on makeup in the morning, the way she flirts with the mirror and when she stands up ready to conquer the day. Our personalities align well, which will never happen with you. Sorry but give up, I have no intentions of breaking up with her just because you have a crush on me or because you have the backwards notion that I should only be dating Asian girls."

I've finally gotten to a place where I can say I'm happy with myself. As someone who has suffered from low self esteem their whole life, this is such a surreal feeling. I'm content in myself. I feel like I've really grown in the matter of barely a year. I realize that I can look back on all that I've done and take pride in my decisions and have no regrets at all. That's what life is about, right? Living in a way that makes you happy and that leaves you feeling proud and not regretful. Making others happy. Doing the right thing, morally. I still have so much life ahead of me, and I'm going to live it to the fullest because I am fucking awesome, because I am ME, and NOBODY can take that away from me."

To continue receiving your love and attention in return. It happens all the time.
When someone tells you they love you, don't believe them. Believe them when they show you. He has never done that. It sounds like you maybe aren't used to receiving verbal or physical affection or attention and you are taking the fact that you're getting any at all to be iron-clad proof of true love - in reality, he knows exactly what to say to get you to stick around, he doesn't want to let go of the attention and security he gets from your relationship, and so he's doing what he needs to 1) get that and 2) not feel like an asshole.
Again - if he loved you, you'd see it - you wouldn't have to talk yourself into it or take everything a liar says at face value in order to convince yourself of it."

I'm a bit embarrassed to ask my friends this because I don't like to talk about the reasons why I don't know the answer to this question. So I was hoping maybe someone could answer it for me... What does it feel like to be in love? How do you know if you're in love vs. just infatuated?"

""To #1218, and everyone else:

First off, I respect your struggle completely. And while we're being honest, I thought I'd shed light on my own, from another side of the coin.

I'm not poor, but surely not at all rolling in money - enough to not receive any financial aid but not enough to escape the hundred thousand dollars of debt (likely more) I will be in when I graduate. I don't just have money to blow, either.
I'm physically unable to enroll in a typical course load, due to mental health problems, as well as a medically-based need for a substantial amount of sleep (that I am often ridiculed for by my peers). Meanwhile, my parents are constantly on my case for not being able to make enough money, both during the school year and over the summer, even though it'd be impossible to handle a third job on top of the two I already run back and forth between. And my GPA has been suffering. (You mentioned an A average? What's that?)

I'm lucky enough to be close enough to actually return to my hometown over some breaks, but the environment there makes me not want to. Tensions rising to the point of a potential second divorce for one parent, the cliche but all too real hatred from a stepparent on the other side, a suffocating pressure to find a job for any break I have (but who even hires someone for two weeks?), and no friends in that town to see, either - friends was a concept I didn't get to experience first-hand until college. There was a job that I could maybe return to, but would get verbally abused at. So I don't return to that town, if I can help it. I spend my summers here, mainly because I can't go anywhere else. And am lucky if I'll ever earn enough to just break even on costs.

If you asked me if I was happy, I wouldn't be sure. Depression is a heartless demon, but on the off chance I get to escape, though rare, I am thankful. My experiences may have been painful, but having had them, I have more respect for others' - regardless of the form your fight may be in. It's a shame so many have wars to wage, but it's amazing we've been able to make it here. So props to you, too, for thriving despite the opposition. It's been inspiring to chase my dreams alongside all of you."""

Why is there so much judgment when girls have casual sex? Call me thirsty sure, but why is it so wrong? I am clear about my intentions and avoid hurting people. I am not a terrible person. My moral code is pretty decent. That double standard with guys being studs and girls being whores is aggravating. Not only do I feel the judgment from others, but I'm judging myself...just because society tells me that women cannot be sexual creatures in the same way that men can. Wow. My own feminism is surprising to me. Girl power?"

""To all the people complaining about those of us receiving quite a bit of aid to come here:

I don't just have money to blow. Try being from another extreme of the country, only being able to go home once, or if I'm really lucky, twice a year, and having to shell out thousands of dollars for plane tickets-money that I wouldn't have unless I slaved my ass off working max hours while also maintaining an A average GPA at an Ivy League institution during the school year. 
Try not being able to pay that """"minimal"""" $3,000 student contribution unless you again slave your ass off staying here during the summer to work because you don't have a job to go home to, because it's not your fault that you grew up in a community that's in need of jobs-where they are all taken. 

I didn't vacation on some luxurious beach during Spring Break. I stayed here and sucked it all up. 

Am I happy? Hell yeah I'm happy! 
I'm grateful to be so fortunate to attend a school like this and be able to reflect on all I've been through, it's beautiful.
At the end of the day, it's not worth it to be mad about working, working, and working most of the time.
I've learned to embrace what my life is and have taken pride in maintaining a positive and respectful attitude toward others and what life presents me with. 
In a life like this there is no time for petty BS and criticism, only room for optimism and a will to see those you surround yourself with be happy and chase their dreams, while you chase yours."

""I see these prefrosh asking about how hard Cornell is, if they'll be able to survive academically, and, as a freshman, I want to tell them my honest opinion. More specifically, I want to let them know that Cornell will be the hardest thing they've ever done. I want to let the kids coming from my background especially know that, no, Cornell may not be worth it. If you're poor, struggle with your home life and look to college in general as an escape from dire living situations, no, Cornell isn't the place for you, imo.
I want to warn them because no one warned me. 
It's not just the grade deflation, it's the egos, the winter, the asshole advisors, and, if you're in the sciences, the profs who care more about research and their resumes than they do about undergrads. It's your friends who look down their noses at your either for your socioeconomic status, your low number of credits, or your grades. It's overachieving humble braggers who never shut up. 
And yea, folks may respond to this confession with, """"Well, not everyone has a shitty time here..."""" 
And that's fine. But, on the other hand, not everyone loves Cornell to death either. I guess, overall, I don't want some poor kid making the same mistake I did. I don't want someone to be stuck like me and have to spend four years at a school they don't fit in at trying to fix it because they can't transfer with a shitty GPA. 
I want these kids to know that Cornell isn't just *college.* It is, to me, a back-breaking place that certain people (like myself) just can't handle. I don't care how smart you were in hs, how many As you got, how high your test scores were, how much of a nerd you were, you *will* work your ass off here (unless you're a genius). If you're ready for that, go ahead, attend. 
If not, find another school. Don't force yourself to go here because of prestige, or because it's the only Ivy you got into, or because your friends are going, or whatever. Make sure Cornell *fits* you. This decision is a pretty big one. Don't rush it. """

At this point, I dread going back to Cornell more than anything. Being home over break let me finally get away from all of these ridiculous obligations that I'm not even sure how I got into. I feel no desire to do well in school or succeed in any of my other activities, and being in Ithaca just consistently feels like a fucking nightmare I won't be able to leave for the next three years. Basically, all of my motivation is gone. I just don't see the point of it all when everything is really so ridiculously arbitrary."

I just reread a song I wrote about you a couple of months back, about what we were, about what you meant to me.
And you don't know. 
Isn't it funny how we don't understand the impact we have on each other's lives? In general, people mean more to others than they'll ever know because the majority of time we don't tell others the impact they've had on us.
This isn't about telling you the impact though; I'm not scared to. I just realize things are done. All I hope is that one day I inspire someone to write something about me. I want to be someone's muse :)"

""Obnoxious prudes"" confession here. Some (but only some) people who hook up infuriate us too, as much as we probably infuriate you. Here's how we really feel about you. We don't have special someones in our lives either, we flirt with other people too, and most of us probably don't judge much for the fact that you have one night stands. BUT we do judge you for being a dependent, emotional mess about not having a special someone, being irresponsible and having to get morning after pills all the time, drunk dialing us and expecting us to come save you from whatever frat you are at, and then freaking all your friends out when you decide to drown your love life sorrows in alcohol/drugs just because he told all his friends/hasn't texted back... and once we have nursed your bruised ego from rejection and loneliness, YOU DO IT ALL AGAIN. Did I mention that you think we are obnoxious, prudish, boring? Who's judging who? 

You make our lives complicated and take us for granted."

Some people might see a spring break spent in Ithaca as boring compared to a trip to the Caribbean, or home, or just away, but I still found it nice and relaxing. I slept as much as I wanted, I actually got to cook real food, I went to the mall and took my time instead of rushing to shop and get back, I watched TV... These were all things I would've done no matter where I went anyway, it was just cheaper and without the travel hassle. Ithaca's also a nice place, and the weather wasn't even bad for break. The only downside is that my dog didn't come and visit."

I'm a (girl) senior in high school who recently got accepted to Cornell's College of Engineering for the Class of 2018. I know it's an incredible opportunity to be able to study at an Ivy League school and that I'm lucky to have been accepted, but I'm reading all these confessions and going on college confidential and college prowler and it seems like at Cornell I'd just be drowning in work, suffer from grade deflation and have a terrible GPA, and become depressed. Especially in engineering, I know the workload is already rigorous - but I'm scared I wouldn't be able to keep up with the work or wouldn't be smart enough to understand the material. I'm not a genius by any standard, and I'm already struggling with AP Physics C in high school. Is Cornell really worth it? Would I be able to enjoy my time there? How many of you actually feel oppressed and depressed by the workload?"

It's excruciatingly difficult for me to make friends with the people physically around me. Not because I lack social skills, but because we share no common ground. I come across as boring or quiet, when in reality I'm just in the wrong environment. I feel like a square peg in a round hole. We practically (okay, figuratively) speak different languages. But maybe we literally speak different languages, too: you all use jargon, jokes, and references that completely fly over my head. I know it's bad to be greedy, because I already have a lot of great friends on the web, but sometimes it hurts not having friends to live with and experience everything side-by-side."

I completely feel for the guys who've posted about the frustrations of being a ""nice guy"". The truth is though, the rejections we girls hand out usually have very little to do with how nice or not nice of a guy you are. It's very shallow, but simple -- it all comes down to appearance. If a girl gets along with you really well and you guys seem to click very well but she STILL friendzones you and indicates that she doesn't see you as more than a friend, literally the only reason that could be is that she isn't attracted to you sexually, which means you're not physically appealing to her. Sure, she might actually just not like you as a person, but assuming that you guys do actually get along very well, there's no other reason for her to turn you down if it's not a physical thing. So no, becoming a jerk isn't going to make you any more attractive; if anything, you'll just be an ugly jerk."

""honest question: why don't more guys ask girls on actual dates in college?
one guy, since I've been here this year has asked me on an actual date to go out to dinner.
Some have asked me to get lunch/dinner at a dining hall or to a formal which is slightly better but the majority have just wanted to """"hang out""""/""""watch some tv""""
The thing is I don't want to hang out with you if that's your euphemism for hooking up. I would never use a guy to just buy me dinner; I always offer to pay my half because I do feel bad and I don't want to take advantage especially if I'm not actually sure I like them back. But asking me out is about effort. It's about showing that you're not just using me/that you're interested in knowing me. I do not judge anyone who just hooks up without dating; hell, sometimes I feel like just hooking up but it's not something I'm comfortable with (at least not yet).
I guess this is a plea to guys to please ask girls on actual dates. I get you're a broke college student but it doesn't have to be anything special/expensive. I just want to know that you know there's more to me than just being any other girl/any other body. Let me know you're interested in me as a person and you won't be disappointed. Besides the fact, if you ask most girls on campus on an actual date the smart ones won't rejected you because it shows rare breeding. """

""While I am medically on the upper end of normal weight, I would consider myself really fat as my stomach probably has three inches on it that don't need to be there. I was wondering if I could get some anonymous fitness advice:

How should I be exercising when I only have at most 1-1.5 hours every other day to commit to exercising when I mainly want to lose stomach fat and gain a core? I don't want to be buff - just have no flab and *maybe* have a rough outline of abs. I know I can eat better (which I am on a mission to do so for the rest of the semester and over the summer), and can go harder on workouts, but am I doing the right exercises?

""When guys here lament at being stuck with a friendship, some girls here (and in general) are quick to get defensive and all, """"What's wrong with her friendship blah blah?"""" I'm sorry, but I find this hypocritical. You don't owe him anything, why does he owe you something? So, using myself as an example, and because I'm bored on spring break, I'm going to tell you what's wrong with her friendship. Keep mind, this actually applies to both sexes (although guys are the ones more traditionally """"friendzoned""""):

1) It's not what I what I was looking for. If you open up a present on Christmas, and you get a android instead of an iPhone, you're going to be disappointed. In fact, let's say you really wanted an android instead of an iPhone, and you get a iPhone, you're going to be disappointed. There's nothing inherently wrong with an iPhone (or an android), but if it's not what you're looking for, disappointment is natural. There's nothing inherently wrong with your friendship, but it's not what I was looking for.

2) I have plenty of friends. At any given time, I have dozens, if not hundreds, of friends that I barely have the time for and already don't know what to do with, so having another friend...well...who cares? It's like buying Pokemon cards, looking for a holographic Charizard, and all you get are Pidgeys; and then some jerk comes along with a Charizard, and you're like """"Yo lemme get that Charizard?!"""" And they're like, """"Nah....Tell you what doe...how about I give you this Pidgey?"""" So you're like """"motherfucker, I already got Pidgey's out the ass. I don't need anymore. Just forget it."""" And then the guy's like, """"WHAT'S WRONG WITH MY PIDGEY?"""" 

3) You ever wave a steak in front of a lion? Because that's what being friends with someone you like feels like, both sexually and emotionally. Maybe a guy (or girl) doesn't feel like subjecting himself to that kind of torture, and that's a personal, respectable choice.

4) You're not what I'm looking for in a friend. Just because you're what I was looking for in a partner, does not mean you're what I was looking for in a friend. Have you ever stopped to think that you're simply not friend material? I mean, it makes sense right? You friended the guy because he's not dating material, but you did see him fit as a friend material, so clearly there's a difference between the two. The guy just flipped it and used it the other way around, and that's perfectly fine.

So there you have it--four explanations for what's wrong with your friendship. Ultimately, I think if both parties understood each other, there would be a lot less bitching going around. Guys, she doesn't owe you a date, so if she friends you, don't bitch about it, or think less of her.

""As a guy who is all too familiar with the whole """"nice guy"""" issue - let me tell you what girls are attracted to generally - no one is attracted to jerks or assholes unless they are very shallow or themselves a jerk, especially not intelligent girls such as the ones you find on this campus.

However, they are attracted to confidence a high self esteem and to guys who can take care of themselves. A good body also helps to be perfectly honest -- I used to think that it didn't, and some girls will tell you that it doesn't because they don't want to seem shallow, but it absolutely does - guess why, because it shows you take care of yourself and it helps you project confidence. The KEY point is that you can be a perfectly nice, respectful, intelligent/nerdy, well-mannered, chivalrous, stand-up, even a sensitive guy AND have all of the above qualities as well.

And at least in my experience, girls absolutely LOVE that combination. They value both sets of qualities and if you have the whole package, you aren't going to have a problem.

The misconception exists, because """"nice guys"""" all too often act overly or artificially nice because they are desperate or they are trying to compensate for something, and it almost comes across as needy. When you are so insanely respectful and gentle, it comes across as groveling and you achieve the opposite of your desired outcome."""

""I posted on here a while ago about my fears that science is now being directed by lucrativity and the potential for a """"glamorous"""" paper. This blog post (linked below) from plant science journal sums it up well. Discovery for the fun of it is dying. No one does exploratory studies anymore--just looking around in the world to see what curiosities you might find. Why is this the case? No institution or government organization will provide the funding (despite the comparative cheapness of this work). There's always a chance that you won't find a thing, and, even worse in the eyes of your funding source, you have no idea what you'll find. Most science these days, believe it or not, is done when the researcher has a pretty good idea of the answer. It's not because this is all the researchers want to study, but rather all they could get funding for.

The only solutions I can come up with is for researchers to utilize crowdfunding with sites like Kickstarter. The basic research I'm discussing here is much cheaper than your typical NSF or NIH grant size. Do you smart Cornellians have any ideas? I'm graduating form Cornell in a year, and I really want to be able to do this exploratory science despite the terrible funding climate that exists today."

""My long-distance relationship has been in a less-than-ideal state for months, but we were both trying hard. We visited each other as often as possible (unfortunately, that means about once a semester) and Skyped daily. We had our issues, but we both knew we loved each other, and at the end of the day we were comforted by what seemed an unshakable bond.
Then I came out as an asexual biromantic (instead of bisexual) and although my boyfriend hasn't broken up with me yet, I'm afraid it's heading that way. We still Skype, and he says he'll visit me at the end of his semester, but it feels like he secretly is just waiting for me to change his mind.

The thing is, this didn't come to a surprise to him at all. He's always known I don't enjoy sex, even after I stopped having panic attacks during/after. At first I blamed it on being molested years ago, although I knew that after a few months, I wasn't thinking of that at all when sex left me hyperventilating and shaking, trying not to vomit. He said it might be because I'm more attracted to girls than boys. Honestly, sex with a girl sounds just as repulsive as with a guy; I'd love to kiss or cuddle, even naked if you like, but please don't touch my genitals. I've given countless handjobs, but receiving one is worse - it leaves me nauseous and guilty for feeling the way I do.
Actually, I don't think I can stand giving one more handjob either. And handjobs were my only way of giving him sex without actually having sex. Our relationship isn't based on sex (truly it isn't, although it's what I've focused on in this post - we love cooking together, watching movies together, cosplaying together, talking politics or arguing over bands or just napping together), but to him, sex is a necessary component. He feels that if there's no sex, and there's never going to be any sex, we are close friends but not lovers.

And although he's not coming off in a great light right now, he has been my rock through the past year. He's supported me when my parents cut me off emotionally, he's begged me to see a therapist for my depression and anxiety, he checks in on me to make sure I'm doing my homework and going to class, he's trying to get me to exercise and be healthy. He's my best friend and the only person to whom I truly feel close, and I don't think I could bear to lose him right now. He's hoping I'll take back what I've said, and I wish I could. But we both know I am asexual, and there's no looking back now.

That being said, I don't blame him for freaking out. Sex is very important to him, I get that. I understand that his sexuality is just as important to him as mine is to me. But all this does is get me to hate myself because I don't want to give something so important to our relationship.
I had suicidal thoughts before coming out, but now I'm too depressed to go to class or work or anything.
And the worst thing is, he's still supportive. He feels so horrible about how I feel, but we've based our relationship on honesty and if we're being honest, we're not the best match. It's the most heartbreaking thing I've ever gone through."
6922,2014-03-26 00:32:50,"1027

Yes, I still am not over you. It's not your fault that we met at such a bad timing, but I can't help wondering why you don't want to try to at least be friends.

When I ask you to spend time there's always something to do, but you can make time for anyone else. It hurts a lot. You used me as your rock. I will always want to be there for you but now you don't need me so you're done with me. It feels shitty. I give you the emotional support you want but when I need someone, I cant talk to you.

Here's to another night of crying myself to sleep. Having a long distance relationship and barely having friends are hard on the mind..."

No wonder everyone hated you in high school, you're such a bitch"
6959,2014-03-25 08:42:11,"990

It's been frustrating me so much how I can't ever seem to attract anyone enough for them to stick around. I'm pretty confident in myself and my attractiveness and I do have a good sense of humor. Am I really not that desirable?"
6960,2014-03-24 23:10:13,"989

I have a great girlfriend and I love her, I really do. But there's this girl in my class who is amazing...All of her interests, her fun easy-going personality, her ambition, her sense of humor, how chill she is, everything about her is perfect. She's single and we're coming to be really good friends. If I were single, I would ask her out because she is exactly and more than I could ever dream of in a girl. I'm glad we're friends but I sometimes wonder if I'd be happier with her over my girlfriend. My girlfriend lives so far away, can be so immature sometimes because she is in high school still, and for some reason I don't feel that inner spark and excitement I feel with this other girl. I wish I knew how to handle this right. I know I won't ever cheat on my girlfriend, but I'm really interested in my new friend."
6961,2014-03-24 23:59:15,"988

I've been an asshole. And now I am losing everything."

Being benevolent towards someone who doesn't give you respect isn't going to earn you any brownie points. You need to treat yourself better."

The guy who got on a Route 10 at 4pm today at Sage Hall wearing black Northface coat, two-tone grey Adidas Michigan beanie and black Burton backpack, holding a black iPhone with matte black case, sitting alone on the second row to the back door, you are cute. Let's be friends."
6964,2014-03-24 23:06:19,"985

I'm awkward as fuck, and every time I try to be friendly to people it backfires immensely. Everyone makes fun of me for it. I hate being around people. I hate myself. I hate everything. I want to curl up in a ball in my room and stay there for maybe 10 years."
6965,2014-03-24 23:52:20,"984

Fuck him. YOU should have gotten to choose if you wanted to stay with the guy who cheated on you. People like that only make excuses because they're too pathetic to take responsibility for their own actions. And it will always be a never-ending cycle with these assholes because they never man up and actually get the stones to apologize."
6971,2014-03-24 23:24:34,"978

As a white male into latin/spanish women, it pisses me off when brunette white girls have dark fake tans. When I see them in class or meet them out at bars I'm fooled into thinking they're exotic but then I find them on facebook and am disappointed to see they have some Anglo-American last name."

Sometimes I feel as if my friends are only my friends because I have no one else. They hang out together more than I do. I try but, it is hard. It is easier to fade away than to try. They say we are all best friends but I don't feel that way. I don't deserve their friendship."

I love how I try to make friends and things seem to go really well but then they disappear as if nothing ever happened. Please just talk to me already, I'm in need of someone to hang out with and I'm the only one making advances..."
6989,2014-03-24 00:55:11,"957

You know, I get if you don't want to hang out and be friends after we had a thing. I get it if it's awkward for you or something. But I'd much rather you tell me that so I can get over you instead of you telling me you want to be friends then cancel our plans and completely ignore me and my texts after that. It makes you seem like a dick."
6990,2014-03-24 00:46:13,"956

I was completely content just playing the field, but you changed my mind, made me feel something, made me think you felt something too and wanted more. I know you're scared and that this is all new to you, but you hurt me by being committal one moment and non-committal the next, and threw away an opportunity for something more. I deserve better than that and I won't be a rag doll to anyone ever again, so bye."
6991,2014-03-24 00:36:15,"955

I'm sorry. I'm sorry I don't have a reason why I don't love you. And I know that hurts, I've been on the receiving end of that before too. But I just don't. And I can't change how I feel. I'm not going to come up with bullshit about how I'm just not feeling it, or that we don't click, or whatever. Because despite the fact that we're good for each other, and we get along well, even when we don't, there's something about this that I don't want. And it frustrates me too, that I don't know why. So please please don't push for a relationship right now. Because the answer isn't going to be what you want. I keep being told by all your friends that you're a good guy -- it's like they can sense that I might run. And I don't want to. But it's just not there, whatever ""it"" is. I am so sorry."
6992,2014-03-23 23:05:16,"954

I opened up to you but you threw my trust back in my face just to make a condescending point. I feel like I have to watch what is say now whenever I talk to you since you always make it a point to belittle me right after. I don't trust you anymore"
6993,2014-03-23 23:38:17,"953

You can't not text me for two weeks and then text me when you see me on campus one day. Not cool asshole."

I feel like I'm always putting people as a priority in my life when I'm merely an option in theirs. It's so tiring. Why am I always a shoulder to cry on, and when I need somebody, everyone is too busy? Am I that worthless? Do I care too much? It seems like being selfish is the way to be happy in this school :("

""From my experience with hook ups, it seems like there are quite a few (frat) guys who don't know how a condom should properly fit. To be fair, the guys I hooked up with were well endowed (7-8 inches), and I know large condoms are expensive and not as easy to attain. But, it was clear that the condoms they used were way too tight for them and it ended up breaking. Twice. On separate occasions this semester.
I'm sorry guys, but the downside of being larger than average is that you have to be more careful about what size condoms you use and this will probably mean dishing out more money for those magnums and magnum XL condoms that will properly fit you. Please don't wait until the condom breaks to realize that the ones you get at Gannett are not the right ones for you. I don't want other girls to have to suffer through the same ordeal that I've recently been through because of your ignorance. This is a serious matter and everyone who is sexually active should be properly educated about proper condom usage. Including girls who also need to be mindful of this potential risk. It's not just the male's responsibility to be informed, ladies."""

I love Cornell. Coming here was the best decision ever made. And I love the United States. People always complain how America has the worst highway infrastructure and the worst roads in the developed world. Well as an immigrant, let tell you they are orders of magnitude better than where I grew up -- my most salient memory from growing up in the third world was taking the bus to middle school. I would put my backpack on my lap, cause there was nowhere else to put it on those crammed buses, the road would be riddled with potholes and the bus would have zero suspension, so my backpack would just bounce crazily on my lap and give me the most insane boners and then when we got to the school I would have to figure out how to hide the huge tent I had pitched. And those boners would not go away. Regular boners would go away pretty quickly. Bus boners would stick around. That's why we should invest in a better infrastructure."
7022,2014-03-22 15:09:16,"924

You are so frustrating. Emotions were never supposed to be part of this, but we're both human, and all else aside, we're connected now. I'm so intrigued by you, and worried about who you're going to be for the rest of your life. I know there's no changing people, but damn. I choose to believe you act like an asshole because you have so many walls up and that's your way of dealing with everything, and I'm terrified to find out that I'm wrong. I'm terrified that you really are an asshole, and that underneath, the good person I want to find simply isn't there, or at least, won't surface for me. You have so much pride, but so do I. Is that what this is going to come down to? A battle for pride? Because if that's how it happens, we both lose. We have the opportunity to be there for each other, but we're both also constantly pulling away just as we get close. There has been such a lack of communication, and miscommunication every time we do talk. Can we sit down and figure this out? That's the next step, I think. I want you to trust me. And if you can't, I need to know, because I deserve better than this."

I have never hated anybody more.
Not only does she act immature, she is completely deluded and things she's the best thing since the invention of sliced bread. She is condescending and arrogant, when she has absolutely no reason to be. Even worse, she doesn't get that I don't like her; she still tells me all her petty problems, problems she creates herself just to get attention. Please get it through your head. I really don't like you and I really don't care. I just hate conflict which is why I put up with this shit.

""I hate having to hold in the fact that I care. I am intense, emotional, and passionate. It's been a while but I still feel these things bubbling up inside of me. I want to just go up to you and talk about why things didn't work out; I just want to know. But I know it'll seem weird if I do. I'm supposed to act like I don't care, not texting, not calling, only occasionally saying hi. If I show I care, then I lose. What exactly? My pride, I guess, my dignity. Definitely the game. Who gives a shit about pride though? We lose anyway when we don't do what we want. It's not that I'm scared; I'm sure you couldn't give me a real reason anyway, I would approach you but I don't think it's going to be worth losing my pride. It's just going to suck either way. I wish I could just take things as they are; you're clearly not into me anymore otherwise you wouldn't have given up. You never have to guess whether a guy is into you. You'll know. But I can't accept defeat. I just can't give on any aspect of my life....
I could go through all this effort and a few things could happen
1) You could say sorry not into it
2) You could be all for trying again until a) my intense side scares you off b) I remember the reason I pushed you away in the first place- we're opposites, and not necessarily in a complementary way

So what is worth the fight anymore? And why don't people fight for anything anymore? And why do I care so much?

""it seems like part of the tradition for slope day is for people to complain endlessly about the artists. I have certainly been guilty of this in the past but this year I'm actually really excited.

For everyone saying ludacris hasn't been relevant in forever, who cares?  I'm willing to wager you still know the lyrics to Rollout, What's Your Fantasy, Get Back, Act a Fool, Money Maker, etc. dude has mad flow. If you're not hyped now, you might see things differently when your drunken slope day self regresses to the middle school dance glory days of music. 

Maybe you haven't heard of Matt and Kim. You should check them out. Or not. Doesn't really matter because they are fantastic live and know how to put on a show. They always bring a ton of energy and are perfect for a concert like slope day. 

Either way anyone who's experienced slope day knows the concert is only a fraction of the fun. Cheers to fun and friends!"

""My first five semesters at Cornell were the most miserable two and a half years of my life. I was lonely, anxious and depressed. I went through weeks of staying in my room watching shows I didn't even want to watch. 

I went to parties and didn't talk to anyone because I was scared to.

I ate a lot with people I didn't like, just to feel less lonely.

I lost confidence in my academic and social abilities. I felt like this place had ripped me apart.

And then I started being honest. First with myself. Then with other people. I found out when I was completely honest with people they would reciprocate with honesty. I stopped worrying whether or not people liked being around me. I started to ask myself who I liked being around. For the first time in my life I made real connections with other people. People who I genuinely enjoyed being around.

I realized that I didn't have to be the funny guy or the loud guy or the guythat'sfriendswitheveryone guy. I just had to be me.

And I'm happy.

So many people have a hard time creating functional relationships. Even the people who seem to be always surrounded by people. For those still struggling, know that you are not alone. Far from it.

I think it's about opening up. Being completely honest about your needs. Learning that everyone actually has the same necessities in life.

It's kind of difficult. 

But you can do it."""

Just because you can use a person for so long (and it was a freaking long time) and just throw them away means everyone can do it and freaking take it. That was uncalled for and harsh. And you dare blame me for all of it. You knew your 'arguments' were only excuses. You are too proud to admit that you were wrong and now you're trying to push everything on me? Are you for real? I can't believe how much I loved you. I can't believe how much you've changed. You've become the exact same thing you despised so much. Honestly, how do you live with yourself?"

I don't know why I'm this exhausted anymore. I have assignments past overdue, missed lectures piling up. I'm not even taking the average number of credits. What is wrong with me?

I've been on antidepressants and in counseling for a while, but why is nothing changing? Why don't I even want it to, anymore?

Maybe I don't belong here.

You can do nothing on your own and constantly need others to do things for you, and even then you are not grateful for their help, you dont even acknowledge that they might have gone out of their way for you. you over-analyze anything and everything to the point of annoying everyone around you.

They're so selfish, it sickens me, especially when I do my best to help them.

In this time when I'm struggling with my classes and losing sleep trying to understand their content, these people's only concern seems to be that they come out on top, or at least succeed better than me. Very few people understand and appreciate me, and I take solace in them, but it still breaks my heart that my others """"friends"""" have been so unsupportive. I've pretended for so long that everything was fine, and that worked for a long time, but now I'm breaking. I don't know what to do."""

Dark-haired girl whom I just walked by (6 PM Tuesday) on the path leading up to the Ag quad from Tower Road, who smiled at me with her beautiful smile and continued to smile at me while we passed each other - you are insanely cute. I wish it was socially acceptable to stop and talk to people who make eye contact and smile for longer than what is considered polite. It's not just how long you smile for, it's also the type of smile. You smiled at me as if we knew each other (we do not). Have a nice life gorgeous girl!"

Things have not been well with my roommate recently. I don't think there is anyone in the world she cares about other than herself. I'm the opposite, and this creates a conflict of interest. I want a friend that will care about me as much as they care about themselves.

This isn't a friendship I'm willing to save, I'm sick on giving and never receiving, of being alone when I need someone but always running to you when you need me, I don't want to be used. 

I hope you have a great life and that somewhere down the road you change your attitude, this will ultimately hurt no one but yourself. You can't build strong relationships when you are so unbearably selfish."

I finally accept defeat. I realized that at times we do not get what we deserve. I tried really really hard, the more i tried the more i failed miserably. Waking up every day realizing i was a failure when everyone around me succeeded is unbearable. From being so passionate and so confident to now a wreck all in a couple of months. I do not feel that talking about this is going to help. I am done cribbing. But i do not want to try anything anymore. Whatever happens will happen. It does not matter if i try or do not try"

I feel like I'm being punished for having hard working parents. Most of the people I know who have financial aid, their mothers don't work.

""I met THE ONE last year, on the first day of school, and I knew for sure he was meant for me. I think he felt it too. We were in Cornell Store looking at laptops, and I saw him first, then he saw me and I felt him staring. From then on every time we made eye contact our eyes had a dialogue that could never be constituted with words. I could sense his presence whenever we were in the same space. He would sit near me in dining halls, and I would catch his glimpse as I walked to get food and sit down. I saw something in his stare. He was perfect for me. And then I found him on Facebook and added him and he accepted. Then I asked if he was willing to hang out, and he didn't answer. Then I heard from some friends that he went back home on medical leave, and he would be taking a semester off. And for some reason he unfriended me. I didn't understand why. It didn't make any sense. This year I never see him, but I think about him everyday, and I know he's back, but I just wish I'd get another glimpse of his beautiful face, just one more look into his eyes, to read what he is feeling. Some one tell me there's still hope??! What should I do to get closer, without doing any damage?

Why does it take me saying that I'm depressed or suicidal for my so called friends to start showing that they actually care about me and start treating me like an actual human being that they want to talk to? Honestly, you say that I'm one of your closest friends but how is it that I have never felt like I was before? Your words mean nothing to me when your actions say otherwise. I don't want any of your pity reassurance and sympathy, especially when you're going to go back to treating me like how you did before you knew. If I felt like they actually cared I wouldn't feel like I do now. In the future, I'm not going to bother telling anyone until it's too late."

Any of my friends that come to my too agree that when she walks in, she just does not smell very pleasant.  She made me mad the other day when she told me my best friend couldn't stay the night, so I kinda flipped out on her over text.  She talked to me about it a couple days after and said it wasn't very nice, and it was kind of rude.  She said none of her good friends or anyone has ever told her that.  Well thats because they probably didn't want to be mean.   Well I'm a bitch and she hates me.  It's been awkward ever since.  How am I suppose to spend time in my own room when I can't even stand to be in it.  It had to be done, although, probably not so mean and now I do feel bad.  FML."

I know what I want but I'm afraid I know I can't have it so I'm trying (because I know I should) to push you away before you can push me away more, even though all I want is for things to go back to how they were.

I know it's wrong (believe me I know it), but it's just so hard to fight this feeling.

I am normally a kind person. But upon this one person, I wish the worst; I wish a lifetime of loneliness, of debt, of disease, of the blackest pit of sadness upon this one person.

I have to admit that I'm pretty embarrassed to be a Cornell hockey fan this weekend. The fat chants are taking it too far. Yes, I understand we all hate Clarkson, but insulting someone's body type is not the way to go. If that's how you all really feel about people who aren't skinny, then I'm sad to call myself a Cornellian. Sure, the guy was obnoxious, but we're better than that."

I know that when you insult me in front of everyone you're just trying to impress the group, but I'm still insulted. I'm insulted that you think you can embarrass me, belittle me, and degrade me in public, then come crawling back for emotional support, encouragement, help, and guidance when we're one on one. I'm insulted that you take me for granted, that you have come to expect my unconditional generosity and understanding, but most of all I'm insulted by myself for allowing this ""friend""ship to continue. No matter how livid you make me, I always seem to forgive your rude, hurtful, behavior. Lucky you."

You are like a positron - you have energy, you essentially have no mass as you are a petite gorgeous thing, and you are always positively charged. Let me be your antiproton. There aren't enough ions in the Universe, there isn't a temperature high enough, there isn't enough ordinary matter to ever break us apart. E = mc^2 won't apply to us. We'll break all the rules. We'll be the theory of everything that redefines love, the unification of great ideas that produces something truly beautiful. When I'm with you I understand how everything works. When we're not together I only see entropy. The total energy of the Universe is zero, because your beauty balances out the splendor of 400 billion galaxies. Please give me a chance."

I always notice you when you walk in for lunch because of your adorably distinctive hat. The blue, grey and white fibers call to me, urging me to stroke it softly, rhythmically. I am drawn to you and your hat like a moth to a flame. I love the way you sing and dance along to Happy Dave's music as you walk around because I too am a passionate lover of song and dance. So in the words of the world's greatest musical film, """"You’re one of those acapella girls, I’m one of those acapella boys, and we’re gonna have aca-children. It’s inevitable."""" 
PS. I wrote you a poem.

[1] 
I'm probably going to be writing a series of confessions in case she misses this one. I know she'll come across these and have no idea who they're about, because no one ever does. I'll reveal it to her when the time is right (if that time ever comes). Anyway, this girl and I are friends. We hang out on occasion, and there's most likely nothing special about our relationship to her. I sense from her that she has no interest, though we have hooked up multiple times, drunk. But there's something about this girl. There's something I see in her that I've never seen in any other girl before. Even with everything that's happened in her life, she might be the most cheerful girl you'll ever meet. She radiates good vibes like no one else, and just being in her presence makes me smile. Like actually smile, and I rarely smile. To make matters worse (but not really at all), she's drop dead gorgeous. It's the softness of her lips, the perfection that is her hair, the flawlessness of her face, and a smile that lights up the room to top that all off. I could go on and on, but I don't want to be creepy, if this isn't already.  She probably has an inkling about how I feel, but she definitely doesn't know to what extent. 

I wish I could be around her more often. She actually lives really close, but she always seems so distant. I have made it clear to her that I'm interested (mind you, I was drunk); she seems indifferent to my feelings, even though that may just be me expecting the worst. Maybe my feelings are reciprocated. Maybe not. 

But there is one thing I do know. I want to save this girl."
7244,2014-03-13 00:31:38,"711

""It’s sad that you choose to treat me with such indifference, despite the fact that I was always there for you when you needed a shoulder to lean on. I know that things got weird between us but that was a while ago, and I’m terribly sorry. I’ve tried to make things better but honestly I’m tired of giving and getting nothing back. Just know that you chose to throw our friendship away. It’s time to move on. 

But I will miss you."

However, I can't leave my first Cornell confession on a bad note. Although things have been getting rough this semester, I can honestly say that I've fallen in love with the best guy at school. He really looks out for me and I couldn't be more thankful for that, rain or shine.

I'm going to keep trying my best at this. It's going to hurt at times, but I'm going to get through it. For my parents, for my boyfriend, and most importantly, for myself. I just need to find those first steps- whether it be CAPS or EARS or, I don't know. Anything. """

""I hope in a thousand years civilization will have progressed to the point where dating will be done in a much more efficient way. Because right now the mind games and the wasted time trying to figure out what's going on is unacceptable. In the end it ALL boils down to 1) whether the person is single and 2) whether they like you or not, and that is usually something they can tell the instance they see you. It's as simple as that. Anyone can look at a person and in 10 seconds say - yes, I'm interested or no, I'm not (and some apps have capitalized on this).

So wouldn't it be wonderful if we could just start with that right away, so we don't waste time getting lost between propriety/social contract and trying to read minds? I think most people would like to do that, but they're afraid of the embarrassment and awkwardness that will ensue. So I hope social norms eventually shift to where asking someone if they are interested in dating carries the same amount of social significance as asking them the time. Think how many people who are perfect for each other would find each other if that huge wall wasn't there. Just my vision for the future. :P"""

Objectively, our relationship probably wasn't very good. We were in a codependent bubble where we told each other we didn't need anybody else. And I was really really happy. But I knew that it wasn't quite perfect deep down. I knew that one person couldn't be all of somebody's existance. Even though I was happy with you as all of mine.

Life's hard. This note sucks and doesn't say anything. I really just want to read my thoughts off the page, not write them down.

I don't want to date, I don't want to fuck, I don't want to be in love. I do want to lie next to you and remember that we both were content hanging out for the rest of eternity. It's honestly the only thing I've ever wanted from anybody. A friend who gets how I think and doesn't mind laying next to me. And I can't find her.

I'm happy single. I've been going to a lot more parties and seeing a lot more of my friends. That's nice. Still haven't hooked up with anybody at a party - doesn't even matter to me - I probably coulda closed last night - but its nice to think about taking her home and to flirt without your look.

You see her when you close your eyes / Maybe one day you'll understand why / Everything you touch surely dies.

I don't know if I should be trying to understand why I see you when I close my eyes or why everything I touch surely dies. 

Well you see her when you fall asleep / but never to touch and never to keep / 'cause you loved her too much / and you dived too deep

So it goes like this; I've had one hell of time here at Cornell. Although I've only been here about 6 months, it's crazy to think about how much I have gone through. I failed my first test, got rejected by a beautiful girl, and did not get into the fraternity that I wanted to. Of course there's plenty more but that's not the point. The truth is it hasn't been all that great. However, there's usually a bright side. I have met a few people here whom I can now, honestly call my best friends. What still amazes me today is how the world miraculously brought us together. I really hope that even after this year is over and we all go our separate ways, we remain just as close. I know my time here would have been way crappier if it wasn't for you guys."

I'm so happy I've finally found my place at Cornell :) I transferred here from a different ivy thinking that the college life just wasn't for me but cornell is really the first place I've truly felt at home. goodbye blue hello red!"

I've gained 50 pounds since orientation and I LOOK FABULOUS."
7372,2014-03-05 23:32:50,"583

I'm beautiful, smart, and from a wealthy family. I can't help but think about killing myself constantly and I always feel alone. I feel guilty because everyone I've talked to about this tells me how lucky I am, but I just want everything to stop. Is it unfair for me to feel this way?"
7373,2014-03-05 23:23:52,"582

""Everything about you is telling me that we should say good-bye soon.. I can't imagine how I will make a living with you, knowing what job you are trying to pursue after college. I know it makes more sense for you to never marry and we want two complete opposite things from our lives.

But hey.. Everything inside you--your heart, your mind--makes me think that you might be """"my one."""" I just want to go Bruno Mars on you and do this dumb thing called marriage when you graduate. What should I do?"""

there is a transgender woman on campus that has mastered make up and female hair styles. after 20something years you think I might get it, but nope. I envy you girl, seriously keep it up. you look beautiful and confident and I admire that. 

[""female hair styles"" is a bit cringe-worthy, as if someone who's trans is trying to emulate something they're not.]"
7377,2014-03-05 23:13:57,"578

I feel like I just don't belong in the LGBT community here at Cornell. Most of my friends are straight and I feel like I fit in better with the straight people I know here much better than the LGBT people, with only a few exceptions. I don't dislike the LGBT people I know and some are quite nice, but I feel a disconnect. This wouldn't bother me except I'm beginning to legitimately feel like I'm going to be single my entire college experience, which is disheartening considering this isn't the case for other people and I manage to attract the opposite sex without really trying."
7378,2014-03-05 13:43:59,"577

I'm so nervous about establishing or trying to a relationship, I just don't know what'll happen if things go wrong. Because then we wouldn't chat for hours at a time."

We hooked up multiple times intensely, drunk. We see each other every day, and we're close friends. I'm fine with being friends with benefits, but I would like to hook up with you at least once sober. Is that too much to ask?"
7381,2014-03-05 13:11:15,"574

I feel so hurt when I hear about how your experiences related to (issue redacted) went so much better than mine, and how the worst things that ever happened to you would be a cake walk in my book. I don't blame, resent, or judge you at all and I'm glad it's been so much easier for you than it has been for me, but I don't think I can talk about this topic much anymore with you. It's psychologically triggering and still hurts me to know everything I have lost and am still missing in my life."
7382,2014-03-05 13:49:16,"573

I'm willing to lie to my friends if it means they don't have to stress or worry about my well being. I'm sorry I ever tried to be honest about the situation."

please, no matter how much you can't stand your parents, your loved ones, please please please treasure them and spend as much time as you can with them. build memories and fully exhaust your time together. share as much happiness as you can before terrible things happen. often we don't act or change our ways or start making an effort until it's too late.

i'm so scared and i think my every breath and thought is jinxing everything else, i'm pretty much caught up in a web of paranoia and fear. i kind of know that if the worst happens, i'll have no choice but to go on like that. but somehow i really really can't accept it. it must be horrible to be a doctor, losing a patient would completely wreck me.

frankly i don't know how i would graduate if this were to happen, i just wouldn't be able to handle it for the longest time. please be strong, please win. i'm not much help but i'll root for you until it goes away. i'll work hard, i promise. will you be okay if i work my hardest? will it go away if i be a good girl and try my best? i'm sorry i didn't see it earlier and i'm sorry i didn't spend more time with you. i miss you already, dad. i'm scared."""
7384,2014-03-05 01:56:19,"571

 I'm learning/learned the hard way that love is not a game. Real relationships are not rooted in manipulation. I can't try and change your mind to make you want me back and I can't blame myself for not being what you want. I can't walk by you looking decent and make you realize that you should try again. I can't remind you of the girl I was when you first liked me because that girl was mostly an illusion of your mind. Nothing's going to change your mind if your mind has already been made up. You don't want me. Fine. There's nothing wrong with me because you don't. I'm not lacking anything. If I feel the need to change, it'll be on my own terms. In the mean time, I have to resist the urge to contact you because it'll be like chasing a dead horse and only hurt me. I have to recognize when situations are bad for me. I have to love myself."

I wish I just had the courage to ask him what i have been meaning to ask for a little while now, but I just have this burning feeling he will say no.

My friend and I talk about attractive guys and sex a lot but it doesn't mean that I don't want to date her. I'm afraid to outright tell her and I'm afraid that all the talking about guys we do isn't helping my case. I'm pansexual and I've never made my sexuality a big deal but I feel like I should  I have told her before we got so close. We are really flirty and I can't help but feel a connection with her but I guess I'll just keep it all to myself"
7395,2014-03-04 22:53:39,"560

It's hard to admit I still think about you. We met for the first time last semester in class and we worked on a few assignments together. I didn't realize until the end of the semester, just as Thanksgiving break, finals and winter break were rolling in, how I felt about you. I had my chances to talk to you after class, but I blew every single one of them because I'm so damn insecure and cowardly. Hell, I even had your number since we had to meet up outside of class for a project one time. But, no, I still couldn't work up the courage to talk to you. I really doubt that you that you thought about me the way I still think about you. You pop up in a dream at least once a week. But damn, dwelling on it is only making it worse for me, and I need to get over this for my own good."

I really like the topics that my major covers, however, I think that it doesn't cover the topics deep/technically enough. I don't feel challenged.

I feel bad that I never go out on the weekends as much as I should. I want to meet people and have a good time, but then again, I don't want to feel pressured by guys that I meet to hook up.  I want to meet a nice guy to date, but not going out makes that so hard!  Everyone that I talk to always asks me why I don't have a boyfriend. I just wish guys were more forward with what they want and talk to girls that they may be interested in outside of the party scene.  I know it's a too way street, but I don't want to be too forward with a guy and be rejected :/ ugh."

a friend of mine was accepted to medical school as an early assurance applicant in his freshman year. i know i should be supportive of him as a friend, but i am envious of him as a student. the pre-medical courses are so hard for me and they were so easy for him (his pre-medical gpa was the same as my cumulative gpa is). i get so sad when i see him so happy, not because he does not deserve it, but because he is so good at getting what he wants in life. even though i wish i were as good at life as he is, i know he is going to make a great doctor."

""I can come off as aggressive, borderline abrasive, and a little bit scathing. It's because my family has always been a little bit oppressive, and expects me to come out as a cookie-cutter perfect girl, who listens to everything they say and doesn't ask questions. It's made me pretty bitter. I've missed out on some really essential parts of the American childhood, and the few things that I got to do, I've had to scream and argue for. Even now, I'm fighting them to stay on my pre-professional career path. They'd rather I finish my undergrad and get married, of course, to a guy of their choosing. I don't want to do that. I want to have a career I love, and a family when I'm ready. So I work my ass off. I study all the time. I want to prove to them that I can do this, and that I WILL decide my future. 
So when you see me, and I have my headphones in, and I'm looking pissed-- I'm not actually pissed. I'm not a horrid, constantly frowning bitch. I'm not always stressed either. I'm just determined to succeed, because there's a lot riding on this one. Please don't judge me harshly. Get to know me first."""

I'm an international student and coming to Cornell was the biggest mistake of my life. I don't have any true friends. I don't have anyone who I can really rely on in this campus. It makes me feel so lonely and I can’t even tell my parents about this because I’m afraid they might worry too much about me. I hate the judgmental looks on some girl's faces when they see my English isn't perfect. Cornell isn't an welcoming place for international students and I just dislike every moment of it. Maybe that is why I'm trying so hard to study abroad and graduate as soon as possible. I really don't fit in anywhere in this community. I'm too much of a ""fob"". I just can't wait to get out of here and start my new chapter of my life."

""My sincerest apologies in advance for this rant:
I swear I live with the 2 most cynical freshman girls (note how I don't say young women).
They probably don't even know what cynical means... 
They are beyond lacking in class and think they are still in high school.
They talk about me behind my back and think I can't hear them. 
They can't even confront me face to face about things that bother them about our living situation.
When they have talked to me (more like at me) they are always either mocking me or insulting who I am friends with, what I do, where I go, what my major is, future plans etc...
To make matter worse one of them is a power hungry b**** who thinks that taking out her personal problems on others is the way to go. 
I could go on and on...
But my point is: just because you go to an Ivy League school does not mean you are automatically granted class, compassion, courtesy, and similar characteristics.

I keep my mouth shut about all of this but I'm pretty sure I have been a victim of verbal abuse several times, but this is my only outlet for the time being.

All I can do for the rest of the semester is study outside of my dorm room and come home really late/ leave really early to avoid these people...

I hope whoever has been putting me through this misery reads this and feels very damn sorry if they are capable of doing so...

""Schoolwork doesn't stress me out. It just doesn't. Which is ironic, since my actual experiences related to my major are extremely stressful. It makes me question whether I can handle the stress AFTER school, but you know what? I made a major move in a club that I'm part of, and it was the most exhilarating feeling in the world to hear one of the leaders tell me that what I did was really helpful. I don't want much praise, but when I get it for things I deserve, it's the best feeling in the world. And that's how I know that I love my major. So much so that it's all I really think about, or care about. Regardless of all the stress in actually applying my skills and knowledge, it's all worth it. Really, the 5 minutes of fame destroy the month of gridlock, miscommunication, lack of communication, lack of visibility, conflict, and indeterminateness.

Cornell students! This is for you! Find your passion! Seek what motivates you! Chase after it, regardless of how difficult the path will be!

I am a server at a local late-night establishment in College Town, and just wanted to ask that you remember that while we want to create a fun atmosphere, we still have to maintain some amount of decorum and avoid getting in trouble or fired. Which leads me to my second point; we are at work for a reason, remember? I would like to have a fun night as well but work comes first and however much I make or don't make during a shift can make a big difference later on in my week. A sincere smile and a friendly conversation go a long way during hard, long late-night shifts. That being said, you Cornellians are a funny bunch and I love my classmates very much. We're all in this crazy mess of a school together; and gotta love y'all for that. For those of you suffering this winter like me, don't worry spring will come along soon enough (i hope). Stay groovy children."

I feel like the only reason I am still at this school is because I've already gone through 3 years so I might as well finish. I honestly don't see a Cornell diploma giving me an advantage in the industry I want to go into, but everyone is so nice here and I really do learn a lot. I feel like I belong here. But I have been doubting myself ever since a girl I knew in the same high school program as me, (but 3 years ahead of me) who went to a school specifically for this field, got my dream job. I want to do something that I love, but I don't know if I am on the right path to get there, or if Cornell has prepared me enough to do the job I wish I could get."

There's this girl I keep seeing around campus, with a pink beanie and short hair. There's practically no chance of you ever seeing this, but since there's literally no socially acceptable circumstance I can spark a conversation with a random girl I see more than once a month I'll say it here:
Nice beanie!

But it's so much better than where I was. I didn't know I was strong enough to get here. I know a lot of people are probably a lot worse off than I was in terms of depression, but, please, don't give up. It's worth it."

I know I said your hookup didn't bother me that much, but it really did.  It wasn't a dealbreaker, but it just made me feel like I never mattered, like it was so easy for you to just move on to another girl as soon as we broke up.  It really made me feel like shit.  I'm having a hard time looking back on us positively."
7490,2014-02-25 20:38:46,"466

Everyone thinks I'm so strong and expects me to be all the time. It's hard to always be the strong happy person I pretend to be. I feel like I can't trust anyone anymore. In the past few months, I've lost three people that I loved and cared about in different ways. It's hard to get close to anyone anymore knowing they could be gone tomorrow."

""Today we talked for the first time in months after breaking up over a year ago.  I was stupid, immature, and put you through one hell of an emotional gauntlet, and I regret my actions every day.  Your patience, sweetness, and grace have stood out even moreso in the fiasco following our break-up, and now I truly understand what a beautiful person you are, and I hate myself more than ever for what I did.  I never knew I could treat another person so cruelly.  I do not understand how you have forgiven me, and now--over a year after we broke up--I can truly say I love you.

If you can ever trust me again and would like to try again, you should know that I want that more than anything. I'm a different person from a year ago; I've really worked on the flaws that proved so damaging to our relationship and have matured in ten thousand different ways.  But most importantly, I've finally begun to appreciate what I took for granted for so long.  I love you; please, please, please tell me you want to try again."""

I can't stop thinking about you. I want your body pressed up next to mine, to put my hand on your muscular chest. You probably have a lot of girls after you though, seeing as you're a varsity athlete...and that scares me off."
7498,2014-02-24 22:18:59,"458

I have never been one to associate sex with love. It has always felt more lusty and animalistic, and I've never really felt that a connection with a person was amplified from having sex; the 'love' was already there and basically stayed the same magnitude. It was just that - sex.  Attraction leading to a physical act with pleasure for both parties. Don't get me wrong, pure lust and frenzied sex can be awesome. That's all I'd ever known since I was 16 and I enjoyed it a lot. And then I had sex with you. I barely even know you. Sure we've talked a lot, and I liked you beforehand, but there shouldn't be this feeling in my chest whenever I think back on that night. I've never had anyone be so tender, taking things as slowly as you did. I was at first caught off guard - I'm used to guys ripping my clothes off without much hinting from me that it's ok. But you took your time. And made me want you even more. I always thought attachment after sex, especially after only one time, was crap. But damn, boy. I was not expecting to made love to that night so sweetly. And now I'm afraid to do it again, because I could see myself falling for you, head over heels, and I know it makes no sense, but wow. I'm going to have to do it again, because that was the best sex of my life. I don't know if you felt it too - maybe that's just how sex always is for you. So I'll keep things casual for now, but lord have mercy, please don't hurt me."

I know she ripped your heart to shreds. That’s why you’re so cynical about women. But you need to learn to give people a chance and stop pushing them away. The walls that you’ve put up, they’re natural after everything that happened, but you can’t hide behind them forever. By keeping everyone at arms’ length, you’re just pushing yourself farther away from any chance of being happy. You need to let people in. Let me in.

During my entire time here, all I've been is unhappy, depressed, and academically pressured. All throughout high school I thought college would be the absolute best time of my life. Booming social life, wonderful lifelong friends that you completely understood and absolutely loved and cherished, and an academic environment that is challenging but fun because I would have the freedom to take the classes that I wanted and had genuine interests in. So far, I've found no real friends and just have been completely overwhelmed in classes I have no interest in at all but am only taking to fulfill a requirement. On top of that, having been born and raised in Florida, the horrible weather isn't making my time here any better. Coming here has been a serious disappointment. It truly makes me wonder why I sacrificed so much of my youth and high school career chasing a facade. Every single all-nighter that I pulled in high school, I pushed through and persevered because I kept reminding myself that doing this would let me go to a wonderful university and have the time of my life. Everytime I was bullied in school because I was the ""nerdy Black kid"", I told myself to wipe my tears, stand up, and think of the great university I would be at while all the other kids would be working at McDonald's. While walking through the ghetto that I called home, I motivated myself to not dwell on my current living quarters and imagine how great college would be and how wonderful my future after college will be when I'm successful.  Every cup of coffee that I drank to keep myself from falling asleep on my homework during the early hours of the morning, reminded me of what a wonderful time I would have in college. My experiences here so far make me really question so much more of my life. The wonderful future I have planned for myself, the wonderful life I've imagined for myself, will it be as disappointing as college has been? Am I just chasing an idea, a dream that truly is just a figment of my imagination? All these questions are driving me absolutely insane."

To the rude girl in PSB on Sunday night: the study rooms in Clark are QUIET study rooms. This means PLEASE don't come in at 11 PM on a weeknight to play tag on the swivel chairs and endlessly talk at your boyfriend while he attempts to study. Do some homework (although I seriously doubt you have any). Check Facebook. Read a book. Ponder life. Or (even better), leave. There's a reason I come here to study and that is to get away from inconsiderate, noisy people such as yourself. Shut the heck up or leave."

I'm afraid to speak to Gannett about my mental health because I know what they do to people like me. Cornell will send you off in a heartbeat if they think you're a danger to yourself. Instead of giving you help, they give you the finger. Cornell may be the cause of depression, but if you harm yourself away from school, there's no blood on their hands. Don't believe me? Ask any of your friends on a ""Mental Health Leave."""

Shopping, taking the bus together, walking back home late at night. I have that now and I could not be any happier. To love and have someone by your side is an amazing feeling. I love you sooo much babe. Youre my everything! I will always love you no matter how bad times may get.

""""""During my first year here at Cornell, I attempted suicide in my dorm room popping pills so that I could end my miserable life. I didn't think that I belonged here at Cornell. Everyone here was so smart, having fun, and being carefree. I would look at everyone on my floor and be disgusted with myself because I wasn't sure what I was doing wrong. I didn't have any friends and my roommates didn't talk much and were very quiet all the time. I struggled to find who I was and didn't do as well I should have done in school. My mind was always preoccupied trying to fit in with the social norm. It came to the point where I couldn't handle it anymore and I tried to overdose myself. I thought it was so easy and painless. I knew that in a second or two, I would drift away. I was prepared. But, for some reason, my roommate came in at the split second around 1 am and punched me yelling at me what I was doing. He saw me holding a bottle of pills and me with a mouthful of drugs. That was when he told me that he cared about me and apologized that he didn't know I was going through such a tough time here at Cornell. At that moment, I began to cry and tears began rushing down my face so fast that I couldn't control myself anymore. I always wanted a friend here at Cornell and while laying on the floor, I found one. To this day, I am eternally grateful for my roommate. He saved my life. He is my best friend and for three years, he has been my side always making me feel better and being there for me. I can honestly say that I love him so much for what he has done for me. If you're reading this now, I wanted to tell you that you mean so much to me. You helped me bounce back my life. It is quite funny that you are right behind me sitting on your own desk writing your paper. But, I just wanted to let you know that you changed my life. There is nothing I can do to repay you.

""Friends are supposed to support other friends' endeavors, even when they know that it may not turn out. I support all of your endeavors, and I try to help you wherever I can. I'm happy for all your successes, and sad at all your losses, and patient when you need someone to listen or help you figure life out. And I see you do the same for other people on a smaller level sometimes-- I know you're not incredibly great at advice or listening, but it's nice to see you try. Somehow, when it comes to me, my thoughts/ideas/sorrows/joys just get dismissed? I'm not worth trying to help out? I'm not worth listening to?

You need more support than I do, and I'm willing to be there, but I'm tired of holding you up when you won't hold me up too.  """

""The act of cheating is a disrespectful and trust-breaking action. It is a selfish action. It shows that the cheater cared more about how they felt than how their actions would affect their partner and relationship.

""I ruined everything with the best girl in the world.  Twice.  The first time felt like it was the natural progression of things.  We were fighting a ton and everything felt like it was collapsing.  So I broke up with her.  Throughout the fall we would still go through periods of being incredibly close to not speaking.  When the semester came to an end, we thought we would say our goodbyes and end things amicably.

But then over winter break we spent an entire day together and I was reminded of everything positive in our relationship and how much I loved her despite the flaws and fights, so I asked if we could try to repair things.  She said yes, and I was more ecstatic than I'd ever been in my life.  But then I came back to school while she graduated early, and I neglected to talk to her for nearly two weeks for a really dumb reason.  When she called me upset about it (among other things), I lost my temper and broke up with her for a second time, fracturing the stability she had built up after our first break up and her original readiness to move on.

Now, she's cut off all contact with me over every form of communication imaginable.  And I'm an emotional wreck.  I hide it well, because I'm just the kind of person who can effectively disguise how they actually feel, but on the inside (and in private) I break down over her.  I didn't realize how cripplingly lonely I would feel if I was completely severed from her.  I didn't realize that over the past year she had become my other half and my outlet for any thoughts or feelings I might have.  I didn't realize how painful this would all be.  But most importantly of all: I didn't realize how truly special she was.

I break into uncontrollable tears every time I glance at just the envelope containing the diary entry she gave me about a day in our relationship that feels like a lifetime ago.  I've called her well over a dozen times in the past week knowing she blocked my number just to hear her voice greet me and tell me to leave a message after the tone.  What few pictures we have together are a constant reminder to me of how truly happy I used to be and how I let it all go on an emotionally fueled whim.  And seeing my friends interact with their girlfriends crushes my heart and makes me long for days long past.

I guess I deserve this torture for the pain I put her through.  I guess you really never know what you got till it's gone.  And I know that I'm terrible person for all the emotional suffering she went through over me in the past several months.  But on the off chance that she still follows this page and reads this confession, I just want her to know this: I regret everything.  I regret the way I treated you after we broke up the first time, I regret breaking your heart, I regret causing you this much pain again, and I regret that I took you and our relationship for granted.  I'm not asking for a second chance; I know I don't deserve one.  I just want to hear your actual voice one last time and talk about nothing like we used to for just 5 minutes.  I just want to relive the happiest days of my life, even if it's just for an instant."

I have a crush on this girl, and I haven't even met her or interacted with her other than online. Never through chat. She's in another Cornell college and we have very different activities.

I have a problem. I know its wrong but I can't stop. Every night, when I go to the dining hall I eat a banana, however, I do not discard the peel. Instead, I fold the peel up and stuff it in my jacket, smuggling it out of the dinning hall. Every night I do this and I cannot stop. My purpose is to fill my backpack up with banana peels, and once it is full, run around campus dressed up as Wario, throwing banana peels from my backpack as it is strapped to the front of my body and distribute them everywhere. Then I will have the most epic evil laugh as I watch countless students slip on my peels and plummet to the ground. Regardless of how unhealthy I know this is, I cannot stop, I will not stop."

""Well, this has devolved into what I can only describe as a clusterfuck. Completely FUBAR. Yes, I was wrong in snapping at you. I knew that from the beginning. I can at least admit fault there. However, YOU were the one who escalated. You were the one who verbally slapped me in the face. You wanna know why I blocked you? Because I would have returned fire a hell of a lot harder. Think about how angry and hurt you were when I said something I didn't know would hurt you that much. I can be a hell of a lot meaner when I'm trying, and since we've talked so much, I imagined a hundred nasty retorts within the first few moments. But, since it was never MY intention to hurt you, I shut you out instead. Can't hurt you when I can't see you, right? Sounds a little bit like Elsa to me.
But back to the point. I was always going to unblock once I could think about it without a metric fuckton of vitriol and when I could address it like an adult. But, you seem to have taken a route that I hope is similar to the one I chose by unfriending me. I hope that you'll talk to me when you're not so angry. But if your goal was solely to hurt me, rest assured, you've succeeded, and if that was your only goal, can we at least be professional when we see each other rather than ignoring each other?
I was going to wait to address how your message made ME feel until you were willing to talk, but since that doesn't seem to be occurring any time in the present future: I'm sorry I hurt you so much. It was never my goal. However, you have in the past seemed to have judged me on that very issue you claimed to support. How many times have you told me I should go out to certain parties? Additionally, if you feel everyone treats you this way, you need to stop and think. Not for my sake or everyone else's, but for yours. It's like the saying, if you smell shit everywhere, check under your shoe. Perhaps it's a line thing again, and you can't see it for some people. I honestly don't know, but I think you can figure it out. But I can't help someone who doesn't want to be helped as I tried previously. Finally, I was absolutely furious that you would judge me so harshly when I spent a good deal of time trying to help you by being a friend and avoiding any and all judgment.
So, I don't know where this is going to go. Maybe, like me, you're too mad to deal with it yet. Maybe you need to hear me say sorry first, though, when I was first too irate to do anything about it, I promised myself I wasn't going to bring it up until you did. Or until you were ready to say sorry, because, yeah, I do feel that I'm owed something of an apology. Maybe you're too mad to deal with it, period. I hope not. That's a bad way to go through life, not just burning bridges, but nuking them. Anyway. I'm sorry. I'm not mad anymore, pretty much. I will be if you attack me again, but I'll try not to lose my temper. If you wanna talk or build a snowman, well, you know where to find me."""

""One who is 'in love' is not genuinely interested in fostering the personal growth of the other person. If we have any purpose in mind when we fall in love it is to terminate our own loneliness and perhaps ensure this result through marriage. The in-love experience does not focus on our own growth nor on the growth and development of the other person. Rather, it gives us the sense that we have arrived and we do not need further growth.

Research seems to indicate that there is a third and better alternative. We can recognize the in-love experience for what it was - a temporary emotional high - and now we pursue 'real love.' That kind of love is emotional in nature but not obsessional. It is the love that unites reason and emotion. It involves an act of will and requires discipline, and it recognizes the need for personal growth. Our most basic emotional need is not to fall in love but to be genuinely loved by another, to know a love that grows out of reason and choice, not instinct.

It is the choice to expend energy in an effort to benefit the other person, knowing that if his or her life is enriched by your effort, you too will find a sense of satisfaction - the satisfaction of having genuinely loved another. It does not require the euphoria of the 'in love' experience. In fact, true love cannot begin until the 'in love' experience has run it's course."""

National Eating Disorder Awareness Week is next week.
In a way, it marks the sixth year of my evolving eating disorder and I am so sick of being sick. 

Once I stopped recovery for Anorexia Nervosa (the hardest was actually learning to eat again) it became extreme bingeing and now after half a year of that I'm pretty sure it's bulimia. 

I want to badly to stop this whole cycle and reach out and tell my friends but honestly they usually just trigger me in the first place; I feel so utterly alone - I don't even look like I have an ED anymore. Gannett seems unwelcoming and condescending in my opinion. 

I tried so hard and just slipped farther and farther back and I'm miserable with it. As much as I want to stop, I seem to be unable - and all the little voices in my head keep telling me to continue or else obviously I'm a fat fucking failure."

The truth is I'm really insecure, to the point that when a guy is interested in me, I rarely take their interest to be sincere, even if they give me no reason to think otherwise. 4 years ago, my first ""boyfriend"" played me like a fool and already had a girlfriend. I was wondering why he'd come to my soccer game only to cheer for the other team... According to him, he was just cheering on his ""best friend. They'd known each other since they were young."" When I found out that they were actually going out for almost 2 years, I winded up cutting off contact with him and becoming friends with the girlfriend (I would, I know) until she found some old text where he called me cute and flipped out on me. When we played soccer against each other the next season, she attempted to beat me up (mostly just hair pulling and punching). Anyway, I'm not tiny/weak (not saying that if you're tiny you're weak! this girl was tiny and did her damage) but although I didn't come out really physically hurt, I was traumatized emotionally from the experience and didn't attempt to actually be with someone until years later. So now every time a guy likes me, the confident side of me says, ""He should be into me. I'm awesome"" and the insecure side of me thinks, ""This is so transparent-clearly this is some big joke on me."" I wish I didn't feel so scared and think I'm getting played for an idiot constantly. I wish I didn't feel like guys are playing a joke on me. I'm ashamed to say that because I should be secure enough with myself to not think it's April Fucking Fools constantly.  I know it's a little unfair but I actually think that guys plot these whole plans in their minds to mess with girls. While some guys do prey on girls' emotions, the majority of them don't go this far and probably wouldn't express interest as merely a ploy. Gahhhhh."

""Dear Boy,

I saw you for the first time today since the really bad thing happened.  I've been avoiding just the random chance sighting because I knew it would hurt since I don't know what's up.  But after being told you needed more time away from me this was more painful than I think you can imagine.  I couldn't look at you.  Even just glancing at you and walking past you was enough to make my heart try to leap out of my chest and my eyes fill with tears.  I don't even want to know what it would've been like to look up.  

Not talking to you kills me.  I know you aren't sure what you want.  That I frighten you.  And that's okay, because I'll take you in whatever way I can have you as long as it involves ridiculous texts at three in the morning like it used to.  My friends keep telling me to move on, and if I could I would.  But I can't.  I'm in love with you.  This isn't like any of the other times I've liked boys.  They've never made my heart race like you do--and certainly not six months after I'd known them really well.  They've never worried about me like you do, they've never made me laugh like you do.  I'm in love with you, and that's not something I can turn off.  

And I want to tell you all this, but I don't know where you are.  You won't tell me and the messages that you're sending are so mixed I'm having problems telling up from down.  And I'm a pretty dense person when it comes to receiving signals if you recall.

But I need you to know that I miss you.  When you aren't around for long periods of time I feel like a part of me is missing as cheesy as that sounds.  I miss your self-deprecation and the way you used to tease me.  We had such an easy back and forth since the moment we left.  

I'd give anything for you to hold me right now.  

Yours still,
Your Girl """

""It had been a while since I signed into Spotify; I did, today, and since we’ve followed each other, I saw your most recent playlist.  January 8th, the day after we broke up.  Four songs, called “Freedom.”

At first I was just dumbfounded.  You know I follow you, so was this a cruel joke?  Some way to hurt me?  But no, you’re better than that.  I knew you wouldn’t do it intentionally.

And then I realized…that makes it worse.  That was you being honest.  You made yourself a pump-up playlist celebrating your liberation.  Our relationship had confined you, boxed you, and oppressed you so much that you made a playlist of celebration anthems.

Before this, I had come to a sense of peace.  I was thankful for everything that we had and shared, for what I had learned, and for what I had been able to feel that for so long I had feared I would never feel.  I felt accomplished, successful; my first relationship had yielded years of love, intense and reciprocated passion, and a fearless commitment to intimacy.  That was exactly how I wanted to remember my first love and my best friend.  That was the way I could have a sense of peace and contemplative fondness; in moments when I felt lonely, I would have a treasure trove of beautiful moments to draw upon and could take comfort in the knowledge that I once had, and would have again, something so wonderful.

That’s completely gone now.  That’s the most tragic of all; the true broken heart.  Now, everything I thought I knew about love has melted away.  The trust that I had that I would be loved that fiercely again has evaporated.  Now when I remember our years together, I’ll only remember the prison I trapped you in.  And the joy you felt when you could be a Freebird.  Lord help you, you can’t change."

Yes, there are eating clubs, but you could just sign-in to Terrace or something. They're closer to NYC, which means you could go every weekend if you want. It's like living in NYC without having to have the problems of living in NYC.

You changed and I can't tell if it's because you're pledging or because this change was a long time coming. I just wanted to let you know I liked you better before and that you don't have to pretend to be an ass. Last semester, I was with a guy who started out really sweet then turned into a huge ass. Granted, he could have been an ass from the beginning and I was too blind to see it, but I feel like what really happened was that he was trying to conform to the expectations his friends had for him. You could tell he was kind of nerdy in the way he was really passionate about what he studied, not in a socially awkward way. I thought this was really awesome because I'm also really passionate about what I do. Yet, he changed and the guy he changed into didn't really seem to fit him. I know college is the time for metamorphosis, a time to figure out the person you want to be and strive to be that person. I hope that when I graduate I don't leave the same person I was when I walked unto Cornell's campus my freshman year. I hope I grow, learn, make mistakes, and figure out who it is I want to be, all the while working to become that person. But the changes you guys made don't feel organic. I could be wrong, but I just don't feel like you guys are being true to yourselves and I don't understand the need for freshman guys to prove themselves. Own who you are; it makes way for other people to own who they are. If you're the guy who gets passionate about programming and rather be with one girl than do random hookups, be that guy....there's no reason for me to be listening to Avril Lavinge's ""Complicated"" as often as I do nowadays.

I want to be truthful. But I don't know if I completely know myself.... Some days I just sit in buildings like Physical Sciences or Olin and just look out the window, people watching.  each person I see I know I will never meet, yet I still wonder where they are going, who they will be meeting up with, what they want to do with their life, etc... Yet I am only able to see a glimpse of their life in front of me... I just want someone who will do this with me. Who wonders. Who questions. Who wants to know who these people are that we will never be able to meet.   I just don't want to feel alone amongst a crowd.  Does anyone else at Cornell experience these feelings?

Messy wavy dark hair that a broom couldn’t sweep in place,
But my fingers can
You’re a green eyed Jew
Wish you liked me too 
Can’t believe I feel this way
When I didn’t, I shouldn’t, I couldn’t
When we kissed I felt nothing
Not the sparks I felt with that other guy
But that doesn’t mean I didn’t want to try
You gave up so easily,
I want someone who stays
Someone who cares about me, puts up with my ways 
You pulled back, I pulled in
Wish my heart was made out of tin
God’s trying to tell me liking you is a sin
This hurts more than when I played soccer and was kicked in the shin
I didn’t do anything wrong, 
 Besides take my time, a little too long
But now these feelings are strong
I want you to go back to thinking I was pretty and witty
Not trash on the streets of an urban city
Can you do that?
Or will you leave me hear lying flat?
I’m worth it, I’m worth it, I’m worth it
All of the craziness I put you through, all of the shit
But baby, if you show me you care, you’ll never have to guess
Because although I’m careless, I never care less.

I confess that I don't care about relationships and the fact that's all you guys can think about, based on these confessions, is quite pathetic given the wealth of other things you can do with your life."

The only girl on campus that I've developed a relationship with is Mary Jane, she takes me to Cloud 9. Thing is she drains my wallet like you wouldn't believe; and I'm not sure if you're using me for my money or if you feel the same way about me too. But you've got to give me space so I can study a bit more."
7736,2014-02-15 22:40:56,"220

We used to talk but I guess I annoyed you because we don't anymore. I didn't think I had feelings for you but every time I see you something happens, it's weird. I'm not sure what we were, but seeing as that this entire thing was probably a projection of my own need to feel love I think it's time to let you go. But let's be honest, I 10/10 would bang."
7737,2014-02-15 22:19:57,"219

I'm just a loser who's staying in on Valentine's Day because she's too ugly for anyone to like her."

I think about what you did to me every day and I can't help but still wish you were my best friend."

My girlfriend cheated on me with two other guys on valentines day....we've been together for the past 3 years."
7740,2014-02-15 22:15:13,"216

The official reason why I ended my new relationship was because I learned my ex and other Americans only use dry toilet papers when wiping their ass. I was so grossed out when i found out. I'm not sure if I can get over this. It's simple hygiene :("

I feel like people become complacent with Cornell. It is an Ivy League University. You should be humbled by having this great opportunity every single day. No one DESERVES to be here. It is a privilege. I thank God every single day for letting me have this crazy opportunity i thought i would never have. Yes, I am an athlete, and I definitely wouldn't have been able to get accepted here on academics alone. I was considering some community colleges before I found out i was able to compete at a collegiate level. You can obviously see how different Cornell is from a community college.... Hearing the alma mater on the chimes often could bring tears of joy to my eyes, and everyone else seems to walk around like this campus is a prison. it sickens me."
7743,2014-02-15 22:24:17,"213

I know you've been going through something awful lately. You work so hard, but it's apparent that you're exhausted and that whatever you're dealing with is eating you up inside. I know you don't want to talk to most of us, but I think it could help you to know that we care, and we will listen if you need someone to talk to. I've been in similar places myself, and just knowing someone cared was like a little candle in the dark. It might seem small to someone who is in a good place, whose world is filled with light, but when dark is all you can see and feel, just a little light can seem like the sun. So I while I hope you can find your sun soon, I know it isn't likely, but we'd light a hundred thousand candles for you."

I'm in love with my TA from a class from last semester. Only he's 10 years older than me and I'm probably never going to see him again."
7745,2014-02-15 22:00:20,"211

I need to do this. I have a huge crush on you. I've felt this way about you since last semester. You are such a beautiful person and everything about you is beautiful: your hair, your eyes, your smile, your personality. Just seeing you makes my day brighter. You probably don't feel this way about me though. I know there are probably several other guys who you would prefer over me. It's just so hard for me to compete with them. I'll never be the guy who a girl looks at and goes ""he's pretty cute/hot."" I tried to muster up the courage to ask you out, but i just couldn't do it. Whoever ends up dating you in the future, they need to know that they are a pretty lucky guy. Happy Valentines Day to you. I hope it was good for you..."
7746,2014-02-15 22:27:21,"210

You are worthless because your girlfriend cheated on you? Nope. She's worthless. You didn't cheat or betray her. She cheated on you and then lied to your face. This is on her. She's a selfish person. She wanted to have her cake and eat it, too. Putting yourself down for something she did makes zero sense. She's garbage. You're just too blind to see it right now."
7747,2014-02-15 22:29:22,"209

I'm a traditional girl from a traditional family.  I'm sick of guys thinking I'm some sort of freak for being a virgin, or thinking I need ""help"" changing that.  I'm sick of explaining myself to frat boys that think I'm a prude when I don't put out.   I shouldn't have to justify myself to any of them."
7748,2014-02-15 22:39:25,"208

I still don't understand Filthy/Gorgeous. A community all about diversity, inclusiveness, promoting cultural awareness, preventing hate, spreading love, and the best theme we can think of is being lewd and indecent? I understand if certain people feel they would rather be sexually liberal or free. That's fine. Do you. But why are we promoting a complete lack of morals or social decency as the norm? There are hundreds if not thousands of LGBTQIA+ activists that are trying to show the world that this community is not a just group of sexually rampant, scantily clad, misfits, and I feel like you're not respecting that.  I have a feeling if we stopped focusing on sex and started celebrating the our unity as an oppressed minority, we would be a lot better off. The goal should be to prove that we are just like everyone else and deserve equal respect like everyone else. Events like this aren't helping."

I'm clinically depressed pending diagnosis of bipolar.  And the worst part? I have to deal with regular people problems too.  Friends who don't understand me. A guy friend who doesn't understand that I just don't see him that way. And another guy who cares way too much for me and is terrified to be with me. Yes, I am mentally ill and unstable, but all I want is for people to ignore that fact unless I bring it to the forefront.  I want to be treated like a normal person and not like someone who's going to go to pieces in a second. Because you know what? I'm more likely to go to pieces when I'm treated that way. And I don't want that anymore than they do."
7750,2014-02-15 22:22:29,"206

Every time we spend any time together I have this overwhelming urge to kiss you but I know I shouldn't because it will bring my feelings for you to the forefront of my mind and you want someone else and that's okay. I just wish you would stop looking at my lips when we speak and messing with my mind."
7751,2014-02-15 22:24:34,"205

I feel like every where I turn, Cornell is trying to squeeze more and more money out of me. One of my professors uses a unique version of the textbook so student have to buy it through the store, even though it it almost no different from the original. Another professor says that the book store stopped carrying his class's text because he refused to use the newest edition. I get parking tickets in areas that are not clearly marked. They charge for the pool tables in rpcc. All of the food is way more expensive than it has to be. I think I pay enough to go here to not need to pay for every little thing once I get here."
7752,2014-02-15 22:40:35,"204

One of my least (and also most) favorite things about Cornell is that in order to get ahead I have had to cease being the nice guy I used to be. Cornell is cutthroat. I love it, but I hate what it's made me become. On the flip side, I will be able to tackle the real world and succeed."

I got a 4.0 gpa this semester and when i told my friend (we are both premed and she has a lower gpa) she said freshmen gpas don't even matter. This always happens; my friends always put me down and I don't know if I should stick up for my self, ignore the problem, or recluse myself from others."

""I bought a valentine's day gift for someone and I was planning on delivering it to her this evening. I had known her since last semester and I wanted to just be nice, that was all. She was nice to me and we texted each other a few times, even hung out once at dinner. I considered her a friend. So as I go into lecture today, I overhear her  (she didn't think I was able to hear her) asking her friend to block the row so I couldn't sit near her.

In that instance, any confidence I had built up was blown away. I hadn't known that I made her feel uncomfortable, maybe even creeped her out (She most likely does think I am creepy and annoying). Sadly, this isn't the first time something like this has happened. In high school, my luck with women, even just as being friends, was very poor. There was even a time where someone screamed at me during class because I was staring at her. 

What is wrong with me? I thought college was supposed to be different, but I was apparently wrong. Any connections with people that I may have begun to build last semester are fading away. I sometimes say the wrong things at the wrong time. I'm not very good at taking subtle hints. I sometimes make things awkward. There will always be a guy that will have better looks, better talent, better intelligence, who is taller, who has a better sense of humor, who has a better personality than me. It is just impossible for me to compete. The worst part of it is that its not just for relationships (I gave up on those a long time ago), but for friendships. I even sometimes annoy my roommates. 

So yeah, happy valentine's day to me..."""

No, really, I just simply *adore* the fact that you only want to be friends and hang out/keep in contact at all when you're having a rough time, with that psycho girlfriend or otherwise. It's -exactly- what everyone wants out of a friendship, to be used for emotional support, and then to be ignored when not needed. Yeah, right. If you're going to be a friend, live up to it. If not, I'm not listening to your shit anymore. Your choice."

I wonder if you ever even think of me anymore. It's not that I want to be with you; we were pretty bad together. But I wonder if I made even the slightest impact on your life. Clearly I cared in the end more than you did, but the thought of me being just another insignificant face in your life torments me. I can't stand the thought of meaning nothing. Even if your thought is, she was a cool girl, I hope you think it. I hope you remember me even though I'm supposed to hate you for how you treated me in the end."

You will never, ever get that, because what you ""thought"" you could have never existed. No matter how much you try to lie to yourself, this man will always and forever be that man who abandoned you when you needed him most, the man who decided on a whim he didn't love you, the man who cheated on you. He will never, and can never, be the man you hoped he could be. NO amount of wishing will make him so. NO amount of lying to yourself will erase this. He didn't try. It doesn't matter if he ""realizes it now"". You're either someone who talks with their partner, or a coward who does what they want and then ask for forgiveness after you're hurt someone you claim to love."

Even though the guy I'm crushing on can't be mine, the fact that I can crush on someone, someone who's actually a decent person, just gives me this huge sense of relief. It's nice to be reminded that good people DO exist, not everyone is as bad as that asshole. It's nice to know that I'm still capable of feeling attraction to another person.

You left me abandoned staring at my computer in disbelief and crushing pain. Again. You made me feel less than worthless, and for that, you've made me hate you. I wish you hadn't contorted my love into hate but you have. Congrats, that's one hell of a feat."

It is so fucking awesome to be banging all of these pretty ladies (i have my mind set on one though don't think that I'm some womanizing manwhore that will do anything for a peek at a woman's nipples (but i do enjoy them)). I wonder if my mom did the same thing in college and knows that there is more going on than just me being 'okay'. I mean come on I go to school in upstate new york (fuck Hamilton College and fuck Colgate am I right).

He was my TA last semester and I often caught him staring at me in class. We spent time after class discussing problems and got to know each other much more towards the end of the semester. He always broke into a smile when I talked to him and would be the opposite of his usual, reserved self. Even my classmates noticed this and smiled at how at ease and vulnerable he felt around me. We had a great chemistry and it seemed to be a mutual attraction. I've been trying to keep in touch since, but he is acting so distant now. Part of me thinks he's just really busy as a grad student, but if he really likes me, wouldn't he at least show some kind of effort? I guess I should move on, but I've never felt this strongly about somebody :("

Your roommate is mean?  Boo hoo, we go to a school of 13k people, you can find somebody else to be your friend.  Never been kissed?  Get trashed and kiss somebody.

Grow up. Be confident with who you are. We're not in middle school anymore. We're supposed to be progressive, but in short, men keep women down and women keep women down. """

There's this girl in my bio 1440 class that is literally so hot it makes me want to cry. She has this crazy long black hair and every time I see her Snapchatting from across the room I fall more in love with her. I can be your man, you chocolate goddess!!! (PS. She sits with like all the Indians and she also has a pretty cute friend with a puffy black jacket. #curryfever)"

No matter how hard I try to get over you, I can't. I want to find someone else but I also don't. I want you."
7922,2014-02-09 23:29:16,"35

I can't express how much I respect and admire you, but I feel that you've left your friends behind. You've turned hostile, and when I try to help you lock me out. True, there was a time I thought we could be more than friends and I know you knew, but that doesn't mean I still can't be there for you, as a friend. I care about you a lot, and I don't know why, but please don't keep laughing me away when I try to help."

Like, seriously, make me suffocate."
7925,2014-02-09 15:13:20,"32

While all my friends excitedly tell me all now wonderful their boyfriends are, I rarely brag about you. Whatever I say is meaningless, they see for themselves what you are. They don't like you. They see your loudness, your overcompensation, your shameless boasting about past sex partners, the way you put others down and make me feel insignificant. They see you are fake, but so does everybody else, and they repay your fakeness by being fake to your face too. When I am not with you, it is a relief. I feel safe. I feel content. I do not speak loudly to be heard over you. I feel sad when I see my friends' happiness with their partners, the genuine appreciation and care they show each other simply because they care about one another, not as a means of boasting or duty. Theirs is love. I love them. They love me. And thanks to them I see you for who you really are and I've had enough. Tomorrow I leave you forever."
7926,2014-02-09 15:00:21,"31

Nobody will love me unless I'm perfect. If I am not 100% understanding or agreeable or sexy, it is excuse to be cheated on and betrayed and to be ignored so he can look for satisfaction elsewhere"

You gave me a taste of my own medicine and I can't even complain or be mad at you. I deserve this. Gosh, it must have sucked feeling ignored/put on the back burner. What I did to you I actually do to a lot of guys and I guess I never think that it might actually hurt them because I'm just so concerned about myself getting hurt. What's different about this situation is that even though I've felt bad about what I did to those guys, I sincerely wanted to make amends this time around. One thing I learned from this situation is to be upfront about my feelings. It might have seemed like I was playing a game or that I couldn't make up my mind or maybe even that I was certifiably crazy haha but there were things going on beneath the surface. I shouldn't have been presumptuous in thinking it could work after I was so aloof. I think all too often we do this, being unappreciative of what we have when we have it. And yeah, maybe part of the draw to you now is that you pulled back, which is not a good enough reason to like someone.
