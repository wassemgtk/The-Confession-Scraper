I only hope that leaving this place will help me put it behind. After all, it hurts feeling affectionate about someone who doesn't feel the same."
1,2016-05-14 22:05:14,"My boyfriend and I will be attempting a long-distance relationship after we graduate in a few days. Although we successfully did long distance during the time I was studying abroad and the summer following, I am scared for this attempt at long distance because we will both be starting new jobs in different cities, with no exact plan of when we might close the distance gap. 

I am not normally someone to get sentimental over goodbyes, but I've had a connection with my boyfriend that I've had with very few people in my life. I fear that the distance will be the end to our relationship in the near future."
2,2016-05-14 19:55:15,"The other day, I said goodbye to someone I’ve come to truly care for this semester, and even though I know I’ll see him again in just a few months, I can’t help but wonder whether I missed my only opportunity to tell him how I feel. I confess that I cried a bit that night, but I’m happy I did. It’s been a long time since I’ve set my emotions free without berating myself for weakness. Honestly, I think it takes strength to feel, and I’m so glad I feel again."
3,2016-05-14 12:34:20,"Last fall my semester GPA was in the low 3.00 and this semester I didn't even get above 3.00. As a result, my cumulative GPA, which is in the mid 3.00, suffered greatly. Now I'm graduating in few days so I don't even have a chance to amend this and I will be applying for PhD programs almost as soon as I start my master's this fall, so I'm pretty much screwed."
4,2016-05-12 08:35:21,"On Sunday evening, I went to the ER and spent two nights in the psychiatric unit for suicidal reasons. I was two steps away from swallowing a handful of pills. 

I'm not sure what I feel about myself... But I think I'm happy I chose to live."
5,2016-05-12 08:25:22,"My girlfriend has been trying for her entire life to get into med school, focusing all of her energies during undergrad to get a decent GPA and high MCAT scores. Now, she still isn't accepted and I feel like she's changing into a different person, someone I don't like. 

How can I help her? Also cause we're both graduating and thinking about doing long distance, I'm not sure if that's a good idea. I wouldn't usually post here, but I have no one else to turn to. I don't want to tell my friends or they'll know, but would really like some advice."
6,2016-05-12 08:12:24,"I got a C- in my graduating semester, and am utterly distraught... Would the business school not allow me to graduate under this circumstance? 😢"
7,2016-05-12 08:05:25,"I have a hand fetish, but my boyfriend doesn't know."
8,2016-05-11 17:27:26,"The love of my life broke up with me a few weeks ago.... It's really torn me inside out. I now write letters to her. I don't intend to ever show her those letters, but I share them in a folder that I would use to send her stuff. She rarely uses it, but deep down I hope that she finds them sometime, even if it is years from now. I loved talking to her and now that I lost her as my best friend I just letters. Most of them are stupid, just talking about what I am doing or what I did, but they remind me of the time I spent with her and I feel better. They wont change anything, but they reflect how she changed my life for the better, and even though we have broken up, I wish her the best of luck. Sorry for rambling, but I just had to share with someone"
9,2016-05-11 17:03:28,"If there is one thing I am looking forward to as a graduating senior, it is to finally manage to sell all of my furniture and free myself, my sanity and my Facebook from this group called Free & For Sale."
10,2016-05-11 17:50:29,"I'm a 5'3"" tall girl, and I can eat a whole pizza by myself, easy."
11,2016-05-08 15:46:32,I'm determined to avoid $100 in Res Life charges with $3 worth of super glue.
12,2016-05-08 15:59:34,"I drank too much yesterday, in terms of alcohol."
13,2016-05-06 13:37:35,The wifi here is embarrassingly bad. I shouldn't be failing bio reading quizzes because I get randomly disconnected and can't reconnect.
14,2016-05-05 19:11:37,"Carvings found in my desk in Olin library: 

me+u= :),
someone love me, sex and bio is a lie

What do they mean???"
15,2016-05-05 18:29:38,"#4003, I don't know you or your situation, but I feel like I might have a very similar relationship with my family. I just wanted to say that you're not alone. Your feelings are so, so valid and as someone who's also dreading the thought of going home for the summer, I feel you. Sending love <3"
16,2016-05-05 18:16:40,"I just tried to kill a cockroach with a newspaper, but it turns out it was still alive so I threw the newspaper in the toilet, and watched the cockroach run somewhere around the edge of the toilet bowl. Now I don't know where it is and I have a fucking roll of newspaper in my toilet"
17,2016-05-05 13:33:41,I'm polyamorous and am terrified of judgment from people who think I'm being greedy or unfaithful. I love all my partners so incredibly much and I just wish people could understand that.
18,2016-05-05 11:14:42,"I'm scared to go home this summer because my family and I have had some history of not getting along well. We're on good terms now but I attribute it to the distance. I have no idea what it would be like to spend 3 months with them again. It's making me anxious. On top of that, I've been feeling out of it and unhappy. Smiling has become an effort and I know I am acting standoffish and aloof. yet I can't help it. I wish I was normal and had someone who loved me."
19,2016-05-04 15:27:43,I wonder a lot whether my friends enjoy being around me as much as I enjoy being around them.
20,2016-04-30 23:28:45,"I feel like there need to be more/better spaces for people who don't go to WILD. Whether it's due to social anxiety, problems with alcoholism, claustrophobia, etc., WILD is definitely not the event for everyone. There need to be alternative opportunities on campus, safe spaces, where we can get away from the drama and the parties. This whole campus shuts down on the day of WILD, and there's nothing else to do and nowhere else to go. Staying in one's room isn't enough and can still pose problems."
21,2016-04-30 23:19:48,"I have very little work ethic, compared to most others at WashU. I think I am pretty aspiring... I'm a science major who wants to go to graduate school. But I'm mostly a C student, and I cant help but feel like I'm a disappointment to a lot of people. I can't seem to motivate myself to study as hard as I should-- not even a little bit. I feel like a failure. I don't know what to do."
22,2016-04-26 11:38:49,"The shower curtain has accidentally gone up my butt crack multiple times while shaving my legs in the shower, and I'm never ever admitting this to my suitemates. Ever."
23,2016-04-26 00:09:52,"I have dental phobia. I've scheduled an appointment with a dentist three times already and cancelled every time. It's never been a problem until now though, because my wisdom teeth are coming in, and it's causing a lot of pain and swelling. I don't have any family near here to take me to the dentist to get them removed, I don't know any dentists around here that I trust, and I'm a loner, so I don't really have friends either. It's just really scary."
24,2016-04-26 00:23:53,"I am disgusted by the number of students here that chew with their mouths open and smack their food. How, at the age of 18+, do think chewing with your mouth open is ok? Wouldn't you maybe want to fix this gross, very audible habit, for when you are sitting across the table from that special someone on a dinner date, or with a boss from work over some food? Grow up, and shut your mouth please"
25,2016-04-26 00:10:55,"A past member of a student group I am in committed suicide on Friday. Today, we received an email listing the counseling options offered by Wash U SHS. As someone else who has suffered from depression and anxiety, I know first hand exactly how mismanaged the mental health services are on campus I know this because I have sought them out in the past. It honestly feels like a punch in the gut to know that not only has one of my sisters lost her life, but that Wash U and our organization at large think that directing us towards a counseling service with a wait-list into next semester is an appropriate way to react. I want an open and honest discussion, but I don't see an opportunity for one to ever take place."
26,2016-04-24 10:28:56,JJ Tomlin's beard is the greatest thing about this campus. #notanopinion #fact
27,2016-04-24 09:52:57,I feel like going to college has just made me tired all the time. No way it's just me.
28,2016-04-21 23:46:58,"Even though I come from an upper middle class background, I feel a huge economic gap between my friends and me. I work a lot and am constantly worrying about money and how much things cost. This is all on top of a very generous financial aid package I'm perpetually terrified of losing. Meanwhile most of my friends didn't even apply for aid, constantly go out to eat, and don't hold jobs. It sucks having to limit how much I hang out with then based on costs. I have no idea how students from low socioeconomic backgrounds handle it here."
29,2016-04-20 09:26:11,"Half the time when I leave lecture and pretend to use the bathroom, I actually just stand outside for a few minutes to chill out."
30,2016-04-14 09:51:12,"I feel like the song ""Rich Girl"" by Hall and Oates describes a lot of people at this school."
31,2016-04-10 21:23:14,I'm looking for classes to register for next semester. Does anyone know which professors would be down to smoke weed with me?
32,2016-04-09 21:16:15,Am I the only person not doing anything fun tonight?
33,2016-04-09 20:48:20,"I got my brand new mattress when I moved off campus this past fall. It's trashed already. I can't figure out if it's because of all the sex with my giant boyfriend or just how much time I spend lying around in it like a lazy ass. Either way, I'm embarrassed."
34,2016-04-08 23:38:21,"There's a guy sitting right across from me in the library dangling his feet around with his shoes off, and his feet. smell. terrible. I want to do something about this, but I don't want to be a jerk. But danggg..."
35,2016-04-07 01:36:22,"I know that I'm lucky to be at Wash U, and I have it better than a lot of people. But I can't help being upset that I'm paying an extra 25 grand a year over my state school, and what I get out of this extra money is worse grades and a much lower chance at achieving my dream. Admittedly I'm probably getting a better education than I would at my state school, but that doesn't matter if I can't get into med school and use that education."
36,2016-04-06 20:47:24,Shoutout to Adderall for helping me to get through Prob Stats tomorrow!
37,2016-04-06 19:23:25,"Psyllium husk tastes so bad going in, but feels so good coming out."
38,2016-04-06 11:26:26,I was one of those kids in high school that only asked people how they did on the ACT so I could tell them about my good scores. I didn't actually give a shit about what they got on the test. I just needed to show that my brain's dick was bigger than their brain's dick. I now sit in my dorm room at 10PM on a Saturday coming up with clever brain dick jokes to get some sweet anonymous Facebook likes.
39,2016-04-06 11:47:28,"Sometimes when I'm really tired and I have to go to the bathroom, I forget whether I've pooped or peed, and I have to peek in the toilet and check to figure out where to wipe."
40,2016-04-06 11:23:29,"When my best friend asked me what college I was going to this fall, instead of answering I splashed a pail of pond scum on him. All he could do was stare at me incredulously. I then whispered into his ear: ""Don't worry, I'm going to wash you."""
41,2016-04-06 11:00:32,I wish someone with programming experience would use wash U Faces to create a washu facial recognition app. I'm terrible with names.
42,2016-04-06 11:48:34,"I am of mixed Asian descent and my family immigrated before I started pre-K. I carry parts of my parents' cultures as a part of me, but I don't really identify with either of their home countries.

I was raised in America, and this is all I remember.

I am an American citizen.

It doesn't bother me when you ask about my ethnicity, but when you tell me I'm not American, it displaces me.

I vote! I eat burgers and pizza! I fly *American* Airlines! I've had the quintessential summer camp experience! 

I do not fit into your black and white Venn diagram, but please, don't invalidate my experience, my existence. If you insist I am not American, please, someone, tell me what I really am."
43,2016-04-05 23:06:35,"e you missed it: 
http://www.studlife.com/scene/2016/01/31/wash-u-confessions-administrator-to-step-down-requests-page-become-dormant/

I realize I hadn't posted confessions in over two months and had never formally retired the page. I do apologize for suddenly not posting anymore.

There's a lot I have to say about the things I've seen while running Wash U Confessions, but I think the article does a good job of summing it up. I posted a more in-depth status on my personal Facebook page.

After the article came out, I just didn't want to check submissions anymore. It had been a while since I could go a day without having to read suicidal letters, political rants and threats. And honestly, I've been much happier since I've stopped posting. 

But I do owe it to the Wash U Confessions community to not drop off the face of the Earth like that. 

I'll start posting again tomorrow morning, and will be posting until the semester ends. Sorry again for not having posted for two months. I really just needed a mental break.

Brian"
44,2016-02-09 11:02:37,"It's time for me to admit this -- I don't like BLTs. I like bacon, lettuce, and tomato each separately. But I do not like BLTs. Everything always falls out. And it's hot and cold at the same time. The lettuce is too crunchy with the bacon. The tomato gets mushy. I don't like BLTs."
45,2016-02-06 20:58:38,"I wrote smut for my boyfriend, but had to print it in the Olin library. I accidentally left a page. He has some... interesting fetishes. I am SO sorry to whoever picked it up. I hope you didn't read it."

47,2016-02-02 21:42:41,"I fail to see why people continue to insist that putting solar panels in roads is a good idea. We already have more unused space than we can fill on the flat rooftops of buildings, where they wouldn't be covered up, will get less wear and tear, and generally look nicer."
48,2016-02-02 21:33:42,"The lady at the world fusion station at BD remembered who I was, even though I haven't been in probably 1.5 years, since I moved off campus. Honestly it made my day. One thing I'll miss when I graduate is the friendly staff. Take a moment to talk to someone who works here-- it might make their day, just like she made mine"
49,2016-02-02 16:15:43,I did nude yoga with the inventor of a drug that saved many lives but inadvertently killed thousands of people.
50,2016-02-02 16:06:45,"Let me confess something: I'm amusical. I don't understand music, and I've listened to lots of it. Rock, jazz, hip-hop, techno/EDM, modern classical, Romantic/Baroque, Renaissance music, folk, world. It all sounds basically the same to me: loud, discordant, unpleasant clanging. I'd get the same out of crashing plates. 

When I was about 12, I hated the fact that I was amusical. I tried denying it to myself. I tried exercises to help my pitch discrimination and rhythm. I bought dozens of albums in different genres and listened to them over and over. I took piano lessons for eighteen months (but didn't get much beyond ""Mary Had a Little Lamb""). Eventually I just accepted it: I have no sense of music. So what? I can read. I can enjoy visual art. I can hike and bicycle. I can watch sports. I can enjoy lots of things in the world, just not music. Yes, that one source of pleasure is closed off to me...but I've accepted that.

Let me confess something else: I'm a straight guy and I'm terrible with women. I'm a sophomore (20) and a virgin. And in my late adolescence, I tried everything. I bought all the books on attracting women I could. I hit the gym. I spent hundreds on nice clothes and dating apps. I got dozens of numbers, asked lots of girls to lunch. Nothing. So I'm trying to accept, just like I did with music, that I will not be sexually satisfied in the foreseeable future. As with music, one source of pleasure is closed off to me. And yet...with music, I could accept it, that I'll never enjoy music. But it's so much harder for me to accept that I'll spend my youth without the sexual pleasure I want so much. I know it's true, but I still feel like if I just asked this one girl out, just went to the gym one more time, just cut this one snack food from my diet...

To me, it is deeply sad that our culture does not recognize virgin-shaming as a serious problem. I think it would be easier for me if it weren't for the fact that my virginity humiliates me so much. ""Neckbeard"" and ""virgin"" and ""incel"" are constant terms of abuse. There is article after article about slut-shaming, but almost nothing about virgin-shaming. Anyone who tries to recognize this as a real problem has to couch it in all kinds of disclaimers, like ""Of course I'm not saying women owe me sex..."" And of course they don't. I'm not saying women owe me sex; I am saying that there should be more support for men like me to accept that they will not have sex. It's not about changing what I have, it's about accepting what I have. It's about getting the mental strength to accept –– as with my amusicality –– the cards life dealt me...and living happily and with dignity anyway."

54,2016-01-31 19:55:53,"Confessions will be retiring within the next few weeks. 

This was a hard decision to make. It's been on my mind every day for months. This was a project that I poured a tremendous amount of time and energy into. Watching Wash U Confessions grow from a page that had been dead for months and back into to a flourishing community was a tremendous pleasure.

But I'm sad and relieved to say that this page has served its purpose and is ready for retirement. There will be more information to come briefly and I'm sure there will be questions - I will answer them with transparency and honesty because the community deserves that. 

Until then, washuconfessions.com will still be operational and I will serve with loyalty and dedication until the very end.

Yours Sincerely,
Admin"
55,2016-01-30 00:38:55,"As an extrovert, something I've always struggled with is being 
alone. Especially at such an upbeat, social, conversation-oriented university, It was easy for me to feel that I was alone or out of the loop. But tonight I spent several hours just wandering around Forest Park, listening to my favorite music and reading Harry Potter. It was that moment when I realized the importance of having some time for yourself, and for the first time in a while I felt comfortable and blissful being by myself."
56,2016-01-30 00:17:56,"I'm still angry at my parents for not taking me to see ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" on opening day in 2001. They said that a dinner party was more important and that I should stop whining."
57,2016-01-30 00:04:57,"I confess that I've been thinking a lot lately about what we do after someone commits suicide. I've seen people filling Facebook with meaningful tributes to people who have taken their own lives and I can't help but think about how messed up it is that we do this only once people are gone. Why don't we tell people how much they mean to us just because we care, and we can?"
58,2016-01-28 20:08:58,"People think I'm weird because I don't like to have conversations, always look really confused, and say weird things. What they don't know is that it's because I'm 60% deaf and literally have no idea what's going on most of the time."
59,2016-01-28 20:54:11,"I came from one of the wealthiest families in my town, but today in class I was flabbergasted when the guy in front of my spent over $1000 on 2 sweaters and a pair of sweatpants. How is that even possible?"
60,2016-01-28 11:15:12,I like telling outrageous stories in a completely deadpan voice. People believe me more often than you'd expect.
61,2016-01-28 11:55:14,"I confess that I find people with tattoos insanely hot. The real world has much more body expression variation than WashU, in a lot of ways. Shout out to any WashU students who defy the expression norm. You're cute and I dig it."

68,2016-01-27 23:31:26,I feel really fucked up because most of the time I think I'm at peace being a lonely single dude but other times I get truly depressed and even angry seeing happy couples.
69,2016-01-27 22:23:28,"It's starting to bother me that I don't have a job and don't know where I'll live or work in just a few months. While I am happy for all my friends that are set, sometimes I can't help, but feel a bit jealous or wonder what they did that I didn't to get the job. Then there are some times when I learn who got the job offer and I grow bitter because they are not nice people or skip class all the time while I bust my ass."
70,2016-01-27 22:10:29,I forgot how exhausting fighting depression is. I've been okay for going on three years now but recent events have me spiraling down and lately I just want to give in...

Beyond a doubt, he inspired my love for his subject, and it was his classes that persuaded me to choose my minor. He was incredibly inspirational to me, and showed me how amazing the universe can be. I regret that I never got to know him better. I never seemed to have time to go to his office hours, or meet outside of class. I always figured there would be time for that later. I’ve considered reaching out to him several times, but I’m nervous about it, and I don't know if I should. I doubt he’d remember me—I was just one face in a lecture hall of 100 students.

Not happy, but... content. For the first time in a very long time. I woke up and I felt like I could accept my mistakes and my screw-ups, in that relationship and in the rest of my life, and resolve to learn from them and become someone better. I feel like I can look at other people and imagine myself crushing on, getting to know, and loving someone again, rather than being reminded of the past and having my heart constrict. I made terrific progress on a huge project today, writing thousands and thousands of words, and while they might not be the best, I can always revise, and the fact that I could write without feeling paralyzed with anxiety or panic was amazing.

I am still fairly scared about the start of this semester, but for the first time in a very long time, I'm also elated.

And on the whole, this contentment, this possibility of love, this tenuous elation - all of it - is so, so beautiful to me.

104,2016-01-15 19:21:37,"There's a WashU Confessions trend that I think we've all seen in the past few semesters. Here's an example.

Confession: ""I hate sororities/fraternities because they are clique-y, based on arbitrary acceptance criteria, separate the WashU community, and are degrading to women."" (3 likes)

Comment: ""Frats/sororities are based on honor, brotherhood/sisterhood, philanthropy, etc. etc. and I can make whatever decision I want."" (45 likes) [sorry I can't make the best argument for sororities/fraternities]

Now, I totally get where sorority and fraternity members are coming from. These organizations are a huge part of their lives and have, for the most part, been an educational and enriching experience. Also, it doesn't make much sense for someone to critique sorority/fraternity life if they have never been involved.

However, I think that a lot of people are incredibly frustrated about their perception of themselves as not being able to get into one of these organizations, a past rejection from an organization, or the spot in a friend's back-burner after that friend's acceptance into a sorority/fraternity (point: you can just try harder to keep in touch with that person; counterpoint: friendship is a two-way street and, especially in the early stages, people are expected to socialize more with their fraternity brothers or sorority sisters).

I don't think that the sororities/fraternities should take the blame for these things. I think, though, that we should acknowledge that many people harbor these feelings of frustration (not just the people that decide to post on WashU confessions) and that these feelings are completely valid (and shouldn't just be ignored). To quote Louis C.K., ""When a person tells you that you hurt them, you don't get to decide that you didn't.""

So what's the solution to this issue? I don't know. I would encourage sororities/fraternities to try to do something about the ill feelings besides biting back. Does anybody have any ideas/ comments / concerns/ different perspectives?

Also, before anybody comments, I am not part of a fraternity or sorority and this post is biased because of it. I'm sorry."

107,2016-01-14 08:28:41,"I confess that I have never rushed (and I don't intend to), but I urge all women rushing now to reconsider their choice to rush a sorority. 

I find sororities to be nothing but detrimental to the Wash U community. They're exclusive social groups based upon nothing: members aren't admitted based on merit or talent or even common interests. Women are admitted into sororities here based solely on if the ""sisters"" they talk to like them (more specifically: the way they look, the way they dress, and if it seems like this woman would be a fun partner with whom to go out and get drunk. In the worst cases, evaluation of whether they are ""glitter"" or ""glue"" also comes into play.). 

Getting into a sorority is completely arbitrary, yet women in Greek life put so much stock into which sorority they're in. There's some kind of unspoken ranking system that, in actuality, is as arbitrary as the system for choosing members! But somehow this hierarchy holds strong, and it's not hard to tell which sororities are regarded more highly than others by women in Greek life simply by listening to the tone of voice that Greek women use when naming one sorority or another. Stereotypes are ruthlessly applied once letters are revealed.

The whole institution, and especially the rush process, fosters low self-esteem and self-confidence in countless women at Wash U who didn't get into a ""good"" sorority or the sorority that they wanted to get into, and it perpetuates a superiority complex for women who find themselves, for no reason other than chance and perhaps their physical attractiveness, in a ""desirable"" sorority. Sorority life breeds cattiness and self-consciousness, not to mention ridiculous costs for dues and apparel (that inherently bias the system towards those who can afford it), all so you can brag about something that no one thinks is impressive after college. 

Once again, to women rushing this week, please just think about the things I mentioned above. You don't need a sorority to have a social life at this school. There are tons of student groups (based on real things like common interests) to get involved in that don't carry the potential torture and disappointment that can come with rushing a sorority. 

To the women who will rush despite my warnings, good luck. I hope you find a place that's right for you. But wherever you end up, please remember that 2 or 3 Greek letters do not define your self-worth. Only you and your actions can do that."

After working my ASS off this semester, I thought I had done it.

163,2015-12-13 06:56:35,"I know that I shouldn't base my worth off of perceived sexual prowess or aptitude with ""the ladies"" but godamnit I don't know what to do. I feel like some sort of weird loser who who will probably spend my life alone or worse latch onto the first girl who shows me affection. It's like there was this period of life where you learn how to interact with the opposite sex that I just straight up missed and it kind of sucks."
164,2015-12-12 22:09:37,"I ALWAYS feel very upset when people are talking loudly in the library. People come to the library because they want a quiet space to study. I understand that you'd like to say hi to your friends, but talking loudly in the library for half an hour is very annoying. If you really want to talk, why can't you go find some other places? There's Whisper right next to the Olin Library where you can talk whatever you like. Shame on those who get into Wash U, but talk loudly in the library."
165,2015-12-12 22:48:38,My favorite part of wash u confessions is that I can like my own confessions without looking like an asshole. People don't like it when I like my own fb posts. I just think I'm really funny.
166,2015-12-12 17:12:40,I confess that I tinder on the toilet. I think that's why my sex life is so shitty.
167,2015-12-12 17:36:41,"One of my Facebook acquaintances posted a status about the warm weather and ended it with ""Let's hear it for El Niño!"" and it kinda made me want to punch her."
168,2015-12-12 17:55:42,"I'll tell you all something I've never told anyone before. I'm only here because my dad donated a sht ton of money and my cousin got in because her dads an alum. I'm actually pretty dumb, and before college I actually thought I worked hard to get into this school. The vast majority of my friends are here because of legacies and donations as well. People are upset about affirmative action because it may be the reason why they didn't get in, but fail to see how one of the above scenarios probably limited the admissions offices decision more than anything. I'm white, I'm fairly well off and I recognize this privilege. Shame on whoever wrote the post about affirmative action being the reason why a black kid got in. Shame on you for being that ignorant."
169,2015-12-12 17:23:43,"I think it's funny that there are a specific few names that you see negatively commenting on confessions really frequently. Not saying I'm better or anything seeing as I'm complaining about you complaining about confessions that complain, but don't we have anything better to do? PS please post on this it'll make me so happy."
170,2015-12-12 00:44:45,"I'll come out with something I haven't told people before. The only reason I'm here at Wash U is because of affirmative action. My test numbers were low to mediocre at best. I led a fairly uninteresting life before Wash U. 24 other people from my graduating class applied to Wash U with about the same numbers as me, and only one of them got in. No, I'm here because I'm black."
171,2015-12-11 20:51:48,"I think my suite mate might be anti-social. I've never seen her show empathy for another human being, ever."
172,2015-12-11 20:40:49,"On all of my college applications, I marked 'Other' as my race, because I'm full Irish, and for the longest time, Irish-Americans were not considered white in America."
173,2015-12-11 15:44:52,"I wrote about myself for the Wash U Admirers page because you know what, I'm my most important admirer"
174,2015-12-11 02:35:53,I want to get a snapchat just to follow Dj Khaled
175,2015-12-10 20:09:55,"My best friend's little brother committed suicide over a year ago. I've never seen so many people come so closely together like they did at his funeral. When you think people don't care, I can't begin to tell you how wrong you are."
176,2015-12-10 20:58:56,"I finally completed the slow transition from ""that kid who does drugs"" to ""that kid who knows where we can get drugs"" to ""that kid who will be the middle man to get us our drugs"" to ""that kid who sells drugs"". Really didn't think I'd ever be dealing, but shit the extra money, small in amount though it is, is real nice."
177,2015-12-10 18:58:57,I would give half a tit to be able to use my laptop in a hot tub.
178,2015-12-10 17:13:58,"Unless there's a grade benefit or I have a really good/bad opinion of the professor, I never do the course evaluations."
179,2015-12-10 01:20:11,I wish Wash U would bring in therapy dogs during finals.
180,2015-12-10 01:00:12,I really really want to know who the admirers post about the blonde who wears flannels and beanies is about...I think it might be me but feel like there's no way anyone could think that about me.
181,2015-12-10 01:46:14,I take my study breaks all at once before I start studying.
182,2015-12-09 19:09:15,"Someone asked me yesterday why I avoid Starbucks, and assumed in the process that I was unhappy about the cup brouhaha. First off, no, I'd give 100 to 1 odds that that was probably a marketing stunt, and second of all, I avoid them because their music is a special level of awful and their coffee is only mediocre."
183,2015-12-09 00:04:20,"I love my family, but I visited my SO's family over thanksgiving and I just have to say it's nice being in a house where the parents are not only together but also still in love. I've never experienced that before."
184,2015-12-09 00:12:21,"my friends judge me for sometimes not pushing myself academically as much as they do. But I can't let myself get too stressed, or I get very sick. My mediocre grades aren't for lack of caring about my education"
185,2015-12-09 00:01:22,I like cereal. I like Potatoes. I. Like. cereal.
186,2015-12-09 00:48:24,Props to the 20 people that cut the line at midnight breakfast. I wish I was that oblivious to the rest of the world.
187,2015-12-09 00:38:25,I confess I overhead a student member of the board of trustees making racist jokes while pretending to be a notorious republican presidential candidate. As a student of color I feel underrepresented and offended.
188,2015-12-08 21:09:26,I'm really scared of getting my first C this semester. It's going to happen. And I don't know how to handle it.
189,2015-12-08 21:40:28,I'm a senior and have 3 buildings left to have sex in on campus. I feel fairly accomplished.
190,2015-12-08 21:34:29,I haven't showered in a week.
191,2015-12-08 21:21:32,"I sometimes underline and write notes in the library books I borrow when researching an obscure-as-all-hell paper topic. Like, who's ever going to open that incredibly specific chapter of that specific book ever again, anyway?"
192,2015-12-08 19:46:34,I want to complain to WU IT for blocking Grindr on campus wifi but I'm too embarrassed.
193,2015-12-07 23:56:35,I wish someone had stopped me from being a humanities major. Turns out college actually is vocational training. Fuck.
194,2015-12-07 11:49:37,"You guys ever find it weird how like cartoon/anime/videogame characters always announce their finishing moves or like really great moves? Like that some weird shit, what if I were boxing and I just went ""Super awesome knockout Uppercut!"" Like yo, I don't know, it's strange."
195,2015-12-06 18:50:38,My first semester off campus made me realize something that I hadn't thought about until somebody mentioned it. I don't miss half-and-halfs at all. Not even a little bit.
196,2015-12-06 14:46:40,"Broadly speaking, I'm very, very happy (and thankful for it).

But I confess that the looming specter of senescence nauseates me. I have this vivid (cf. accurate) memory of my middle school health teacher—himself unmistakably past his prime—drawing a fairly crude, blue spiral on the whiteboard.

He places the marker on the board. ""This is your capacity when you're born."" (Though I'm certain he never said it in so many words, I always remember it with such bluntness.) He begins a slow outward spiral. ""And this is your capacity as you reach your teens... your 20s..."". He continues outward until he hits some nonspecific middle age. Then he starts spiraling back inward toward the center again.

If I enjoyed studying biology more, I'd be gunning for a shot at Calico or the like. Instead, I implore our bio students to consider searching for inroads toward beating the shit out of that looming specter. That would be pretty cool."
197,2015-12-06 11:37:41,"Rather than beginning finals studying and papers, I am binging on Naruto Shippuden, no shame fam, well okay, maybe a bit."
198,2015-12-06 11:22:42,"I slept on campus twice in a roll. It was 4am and I was too tired to walk home in the cold, so I just picked a dark and carpeted area, put a book on the floor, and fell asleep. It was amazing. It felt like camping. No one was around. Just the humming of the heater and flickers of light from outside. I want to do it again but with a girl I like. She could use me as her pillow"
199,2015-12-06 11:13:43,"My usual excuse for not attending parties is that I need to study (which I usually do) but I'm mostly just tired of going home alone. I understand that parties aren't all about hooking up, but I gotta say that it is not easy on the ego to get rejected time after time."
200,2015-12-05 17:38:45,"I get excited seeing clothes on the free and for sale Facebook page, because clothes are so expensive. But then I see that it's all size extra small shirts and size 0/1 jeans and it makes me hate being a size medium."
201,2015-12-05 17:29:48,"I had an abortion in another state over thanksgiving break. I'm sad because I want a family someday, just not now. I'm just so relieved now that it's over."
202,2015-12-05 02:44:49,"Do you guys know that song ""Singing in the Shower""?
Whenever I pee in the shower (which is quite often because I really like peeing in the shower), I sing the chorus of ""Singing in the Shower"" but I replace ""Singing"" with ""Peeing"""
203,2015-12-04 21:05:52,I used regular dish soap in the dishwasher in place of dishwasher soap and deeply regretted it. Deeply. Soap everywhere. Halp.
204,2015-12-04 19:20:53,I saw the new Wash U Admirers admin updating the page in BD yesterday
205,2015-12-04 19:00:55,"I confess that I had sex with my girlfriend in her room while her roommate was sleeping and that while we were having sex I made her say that she wanted her roommate to hear us fucking.

Oddly enough, she did."
206,2015-12-04 19:43:56,"It really gives me pause when I see people of my age write impassioned diatribes about how to fix certain issues that are riddled with bad spelling, grammar, and punctuation. It communicates to me that they think they can fix the world, and yet either don't care enough to use English properly or don't care enough to check for errors, which means, of course, they're probably rushing into things and not sweating the details, as young adults are wont to do. 

I should like to think that such simple solutions could work, but the devil is in those little details. I fear we've instilled in ourselves a culture that doesn't see that."
207,2015-12-04 19:13:57,"I have a Che Guevara shirt. Not because I admire anything about him. He was decidedly south of Neutral on the Good/Evil axis. No, I have it because I find it incredibly ironic that he spent a good deal of his life railing against capitalism, and yet he is immortalized on often overpriced merchandise in America, in his most hated form of market, in one of his most hated countries. It's incredibly satisfying."
208,2015-12-04 19:02:58,"I've been living alone for the past month, and as a result I have become extremely emotionally attached to my plants. I even say bye to them before I leave my apartment. Yesterday, I told them to have a good day."
209,2015-12-03 13:55:11,"I recently aged out of my parents' health care plan. After doing research, I've come to be pissed off at the new healthcare exchange system. My deductible, and it's one of the lower ones, is ten times what it was on my previous plan. I have friends aging out of Tricare whose plans have deductibles up to thirty times their previous ones. We're being swindled."
210,2015-12-03 13:43:12,I'm low key attracted to my Writing 1 professor.
211,2015-12-03 13:32:14,"I want to go to go to medical school and become a dermatologist to live a comfortable life. But I stumbled on someone's status about their journalism project and it's making me think. I don't know, is it immoral to want to have a enjoyable, comfortable life?

The person's status - ""With my project, I hope to show that there is something terribly wrong with the world. In a world driven by profits, children in poor countries die because their parents don't have one dollar for medicine. This summer in Uganda, stunned from listening to story after story of people dying from the lack of trivial amounts of money and from the inaccessibility of the most basic medicine, I had the insensitivity and the presumption to ask a mother who lost two of her five children to easily treatable malaria whether the grieving process is easier because it is expected that some children will not survive to five years of age. I'll never forget her sad and slighted gaze at me as she said ""no, we never forget. It always hurts.""

As a future physician, a world in which some can receive the right to live as a birthright while others that toil in the fields all year have to helplessly watch their loved ones needlessly die makes me angry. I think a doctor is a natural advocate for the voiceless. The poor have the worst health outcomes and the highest health needs, so it is logical that a doctor, who is sworn to view each life as equally valuable, should do all they can do to help the poor. However, the broken system permeates into every sector of society and commodifies everything, including medicine, making a moral duty impractical and unfashionable. But even within this broken system, with more, yet still modest investment by the wealthy, the stories of those that I told this summer would have never needed to happen.

I think defending the voiceless and the marginalized is the fight of our generation. And maybe with enough willpower, we can fix this broken world"
212,2015-12-02 07:41:15,I was really stressed today so I took a plate from BD and smashed it onto my bathroom floor when no one was home. It felt amazing.
213,2015-12-02 01:24:20,I confess that my life has completely changed since purchasing a vibrator. Best stress relief ever.
214,2015-12-02 00:10:21,"I'm microdosing LSD at the library right now because I HAVE SO MUCH WORK TO DO AND NO OTHER OPTIONS SCHOOL DID THIS TO ME.

having a really great time. What's everyone's favorite manic jazz song?"
215,2015-12-02 00:13:22,"As an alum, and I confess that I feel like WashU really was the best years of my life! There were struggleful moments and heaps of uncertainty, there was doubt and confusion, but actually thats just a part of life and alas you can't escape- you can only learn to deal (more) effectively. BUT, at WashU was a magical place, a place where everyone wants to help- not only peers but help global causes and the environment, promote justice for all people. There were resources for every occasion, there was food for every time of day, there were multiple buildings with really easy roof access. No school is perfect, but compared to anywhere else I've been this school is the most aware and concerned locale, a place where you can be listened to and have meaningful discussion. I love you WashU, I always will."
216,2015-12-01 23:00:24,For my 21st birthday in a few weeks I'm getting drunk with my mom. I couldn't be happier in my choice of drinking partner.

218,2015-12-01 23:42:26,"Two people in one of my premed classes are cheating. My teacher figured out who the individuals were, but has no concrete evidence to prove it (this is the simple version of the situation). This makes me so mad because everyone else has worked so hard for their grades, but these two dishonest individuals have completely disrespected the professor and the class. The classroom environment has turned into one of accusations and deceit. If you have to cheat to do well in a prerequisite premed class, I wouldn't want you to be my doctor. Why would I want a doctor who achieved his degree through dishonesty?"
219,2015-12-01 23:31:28,I forgot to pack deodorant over Thanksgiving. I wore my sister's all week and she never found out.
220,2015-12-01 23:21:29,"My confession is that I check this page daily because I like to see what WashU students are thinking, and it's much less of a cesspit than is YikYak."

I confess that I'm consumed by a ridiculous amount of guilt . I feel guilty that I put myself in a position that allowed someone to take advantage of me. I feel guilty because I didn't scream or shout or try and end things sooner. I feel guilty because I didn't fight back. I feel guilty for all the shit I've put my friends and parents through because of it. I feel guilty that after all the love and support I was getting I still felt the need to reach out to someone who used to be important to me, but clearly doesnt want to be in my life or support system anymore. I feel guilty that I haven't healed ""fast enough"". 

I feel guilty that I was raped and there's absolutely nothing anyone can say to make me feel differently."
224,2015-11-30 23:53:37,"I confess that although I am relieved to be done with Writing 1, I'm going to miss those long hours in the library complaining about my essay to my friends."
225,2015-11-30 23:40:38,"I'm in the bschool, but I have a poster of Karl Marx hidden in my closet."
226,2015-11-30 23:07:40,Tbh I have zero sympathy for people who know they're struggling with a concept but wait until the last possible moment to seek help and then get upset when they don't become experts overnight. You knew you had this problem. You knew you needed help. It's your fault for not doing anything about it until it was too late.
227,2015-11-30 23:27:41,"I feel like society has put sex on a pedestal as if it's something that should be amazing, but I honestly have more fun masturbating."
228,2015-11-30 23:20:42,"I gotta say, it really annoys me when people call me a person of color. Seriously? I'm black. Calling me a person of color is about as ridiculous as calling me a person of not-woman-ness. It just lumps together everything that isn't white."
229,2015-11-30 22:04:43,"Hey admin, are fewer people submitting confessions, are confessions being posted less often, or are a greater proportion of confessions being filtered? JW. Thanks! Hope you had a good break."
230,2015-11-30 09:50:45,"Sometimes in my head I talk to myself like I'm a child. Not like a condescending way, but just gentle and reassuring. A way where I feel like what I do matters, but it's ok to mess up. People don't often talk to adults that way."
231,2015-11-29 21:00:48,I enjoy seeing movies by myself more than seeing them with other people.
232,2015-11-29 18:58:49,I'm moving into a single apartment next semester and I can't express how happy I am to not have roommates/suitemates anymore!
233,2015-11-28 11:48:52,"I was going to spend Thanksgiving with my gf's family in FL, but we broke up two weeks ago... so I ended up staying in St. Louis. When I told my friends I was going to be alone all break, they were like, ""Sorry man, that sucks"". But you know what? I had an awesome break. 

Things I didn't do this break: see family, interact with people, eat turkey, watch/play football

Things I did: read, draw, listen to music, play guitar, order takeout, watch movies, play with my roommate's dog, shoot hoops, ride my bike around forest park 

So basically, I had a blast. 

Happy Thanksgiving y'all."

245,2015-11-23 03:56:22,"People used to question me about my habit of procrastinating when booking flights home for holidays and breaks (sometimes until the day before). Or why sometimes I would choose to stay at school rather than fly home. I used to say that it was because I was lazy -- it was the easy answer that got everyone to stop asking. 

But now I've graduated and I'd like to confess that I was/am having an immensely difficult time accepting the fact that one day I'll walk through my front door to see my mom and she wont recognize me. 

And each time I visit home I feel like I can see that day getting closer and closer and I haven't figured out how to handle that-- also the reason I chose not to talk about my family much, sorry. Lately I've sort of felt as though I'm growing apart from friends who I really cannot afford to lose; And a long time ago I used to be able to talk to my mom about any/everything, but now I don't know that I can, and I don't know that I have anyone else either."

248,2015-11-23 02:48:26,"2 of my friends have committed suicide in the past 2 months. The more I think on it, the more uncomfortable I get with the guy who was hunger striking to the point of death at Mizzou. I get that he probably assumed the university would something before it got to that point, and I get that the problems he was protesting are huge and the results of systemic issues that have unfortunately led to deaths themselves, but I can't help but be pained by the thought of using something so grave as leverage. Maybe I'm just taking it too seriously, I dunno. But suicide is heavy, man."
249,2015-11-23 02:24:28,I am a strong supporter of drug legalization even though the most illegal thing I've ever done is gotten drunk before age 21.
250,2015-11-23 02:16:29,"Really liked this guy and I asked him out to get to know him. Maybe it wasn't clear that it was a date, but afterwards we were just awkwardly friendly with each other, and nothing happened. I thought he liked me before, but maybe he realized he didn't.

261,2015-11-23 00:46:48,My professor spelled my name wrong in a letter of recommendation. Instead of asking them to correct it I asked a different professor to write one as a replacement.
262,2015-11-22 21:52:49,I Netflix and chilled with someone who doesn't go to WashU for the first time last night. And it was pretty interesting. I don't think I'll do it again. But I'm glad I stepped out of my comfort zone and tried it.
263,2015-11-22 20:17:52,"I confess I love marijuana. I wish marijuana and cocaine were legal. There are so many worse things you could put in your body that are perfectly legal and yet I could go to jail for smoking a J. As muddy waters once said ""there should be no law on people who wanna smoke a little dope"". I probably care about marijuana legalization than any other current political issue. sorry not sorry."

265,2015-11-22 16:03:55,"I confess that I don't know why it is so difficult to find a tall, athletic, non-religious, college educated woman with interests and hobbies that expand past alcohol and netflix. Oh, that is a lot of things? Nevermind #BackToSwipingRight"
266,2015-11-22 00:19:56,I think it's an enormous turn-off when I see Facebook pictures of people getting drunk at parties. Who are you trying to impress?!

I feel like such a shitty person for using guys for free meals, but I remind myself that they're probably only looking for one night stands anyway..."
269,2015-11-21 05:44:11,"I totally regret rushing the fraternity I am in. Although it's one of those frats that doesn't have a house, I thought there would still be a really tight brotherhood. Nope. Everything is about fulfilling a requirement, and I feel like most of the members are only there to add to their resume. It's not fun, and it's way too big to have any meaningful relationships. I wish I had rushed a real fraternity, but i'm an upperclassman and it's probably too late for me."

271,2015-11-20 14:54:14,"sions — Unfiltered has been released.

This gives you a chance to see almost any confession that has been submitted, regardless of whether it was posted on the Wash U Confessions page.  

Sometimes, there's good content in a submission but it can't be posted because it just doesn't fit on the Facebook page. Unfiltered gives a chance for those sorts of submissions to be viewed. 

I understand there will be some concerns about the abuse of this sort of feature. Content such as hate speech, suicide letters, and advertisements for shitty clubs will be removed before making it onto the Unfiltered page.

Enjoy the weekend, the semester's almost over!

272,2015-11-20 00:37:15,"As an alum, I can honestly say WashU was the best 4 years of my life thus far. That's not to say that the road afterwards isn't just as great -- it, like always has been, what you make of it; and you should invest yourself into what you love. 

The road after graduation is difficult to navigate, and let me tell you, grad school is like freshman year all over again (except without the free Ted Drewes and the tempurpedic beds). It's tough. Your life after school is about taking the memories, skills, and moments from WashU and applying them to become the best version of you. I would be lying if I said that was easy after graduation. But the fun is in the challenge, I promise. But for now, whether you're a freshman or a senior, enjoy everything: the easy and the tough classes, the failures and the successes, the loves and the losts. They make you who you are. 

Don't graduate without regrets (yes, climb on top of those buildings, DO IT -- star gazing is awesome), sled down Art Hill, and stay up late talking to friends. Start your St. Louis bucket list and get your friends to check off things!! It's worth it. You'll look back on your four years and wonder how you could have chosen any other path. It simply wouldn't have made you this happy."
273,2015-11-19 12:49:20,"Found this letter folded up into square on the sidewalk outside the Snow Way garage across from the village. Don't know who dropped it, it wasn't signed, but it's beautiful and I felt like the writer understood what I feel, so I wanted to share. I hope it's not a dick move doing so. Anyway, here it is: 

Please remember me. Remember the moments we shared, the good and the bad. Remember that day at the Nelson Atkins Art museum, how time ceased to move and we stared into eternity hand in hand, and everything was alright. Remember the love that made the world and its endless problems disappear. remember the laughs, the ones that came without effort, from a place of purity in our hearts, because we could always share our unfiltered selves. Remember the moments of silence, when we got lost in each other and didn't care to know when we would be found. Remember the sound of my voice, the cries of my soul, the thoughts that we shared, and every crazy idea we ever had. Remember that there's always hope, that you're not alone, and that people love you. Please remember."

277,2015-11-16 22:00:25,"One time, at a sleep away camp, I got woken up by three kids peeing on some fourth kid while he was sleeping. I ignored it and went back to bed. The next day I woke up and people were talking about how kid 4 peed himself last night. I didn't speak up to correct them."

281,2015-11-15 13:52:32,"I honestly admire the EMS team so much. Can we all just take a moment and appreciate their hard work?They're able to take on a full course load, do other extracurriculars, work long shifts as an EMS, and do all of those things well. It amazes me that they're just students, and the work they do is valuable and meritable. Keep doing what you do guys. You're awesome."
282,2015-11-13 16:35:34,I find it ironic that the University has a whole team of people caulking cracks on the South 40 coincidently on Friday the 13th...we see you Chancellor Wrighton.
283,2015-11-13 13:42:35,One of my suitemates is still mad at me because I didn't clean up my pregame before I went to WILD. We talked about how everything was going to work before the pregame happened. I cleaned everything up Saturday morning when I was sober. I wish she'd just relax about it now.
284,2015-11-13 12:11:37,A couple of years back I was told by a bunch of people that safe spaces were places one could go in order to discuss sensitive topics without fear of repercussions by others. What happened? It's now the complete opposite.
285,2015-11-13 12:56:38,I am so tired of explaining my anger to white people.
286,2015-11-12 21:47:40,Where's all the yoga pants at? I wanna see the cute butts!
287,2015-11-12 10:17:41,"I find it amusing, really, how media portrayals don't bear witness to real life. I'm conservative, and yet 99 percent of conservatives I've met are fine with who I am. But I'm also gay, and a good chunk of the gay community that I've met is not. I guess it just goes to show that social conservatism is not nearly as widespread as it might seem."
288,2015-11-12 10:48:42,I feel as a black person I'm expected to have a certain opinion about certain events and situations and if I don't I'm not considered really black
289,2015-11-12 10:12:43,"My roommate snores so loudly that it keeps me up for hours at night. Even with headphones in, I can still hear her half the time. I don't know how to bring this up with her, or if I even should. For now, I'm anxiously awaiting Thanksgiving break, when I might be able to actually get a full night's sleep."
290,2015-11-12 00:29:45,I am disappointed that I've seen almost no recognition of Veteran's Day from anyone. People will protest everything about what is happening at Mizzou but no one takes the time to honor the veterans who have served our country.
291,2015-11-12 00:47:48,"The current national atmosphere of ""PC-Speech"" is oddly reminiscent of Orwell's 1984..."
292,2015-11-11 11:25:49,"A friend noticed the bandaid on my finger and I told her it was a papercut. Actually, my hand slipped on the razor blade while I was cutting up a painkiller to snort at 3AM last night. White lie, right?"
293,2015-11-11 11:16:52,"About a month ago, I passed by some people and overheard a girl say that doing laundry in her old building gave her PTSD. In context, she was joking about how terribly the machines worked. I'm not an aggressive person, but I really wanted to say something. I haven't thought about it in a while. But last night I woke up from a PTSD nightmare at 4:00 am and didn't sleep the rest of the night. While I knew there wasn't someone in my apartment, I kept imagining I heard footsteps and that I was about to be stabbed. THAT is PTSD. Don't joke around, please. You have no idea what it's like."
294,2015-11-11 11:53:53,"I wish that Wash U (and other elite institutions) would make more of a concerted effort to recruit students from rural populations. While efforts at increasing racial and ethnic diversity have brought great benefits to these schools, perspectives from the broad swath of rural America seem to be missing from the conversation as the majority of the population consists of students from big cities and their wealthy suburbs. I think in many ways the experiences of these rural students are much different from those of the majority of the population of our school and others like it and our institutions would benefit from an increased focus on recruiting students, many of whom may never even consider an elite school due to the insular environment these communities can sometimes engender."
295,2015-11-11 02:43:55,"A lot of people have high goals in life, but I just have one: to be an earthbender. Anything else is a backup plan."
296,2015-11-11 02:34:56,I've heard from reliable sources that the Spring 2016 commencement speaker will be Don Cheadle. So excited!
297,2015-11-11 01:53:57,"this past week was honestly the first time where i really felt happy at wash u. i truly felt at home due to a sense of belonging from close friends, the teams I'm in and the general community. As a sophomore, I am ecstatic that this moment finally came, and am so eager to enjoy the rest of my time at wash u. For those of you who are/were struggling to acclimate, realize that it always takes time to adjust, and for everyone it's a different amount. You DO NOT have to be in love instantly with a university in order to gain a satisfying, enriching experience. It will come eventually, just give it time. :]"
298,2015-11-11 01:43:58,"I claim to be a cat person, but really I like all animals. My real favorite animals are pangolins. On an unrelated note, I give people rimjobs to ease them into anal. It's nice being anonymous."

300,2015-11-10 23:07:12,I am bitter and cynical but still love an old friend intensely. I was emotionally abusive to them and lost them permanently...I want to find some way to honor them.
301,2015-11-10 23:59:14,"There is no such thing as a rape culture, only bad statistics and dishonest journalism. People fall victims of rape, but they don't need the fantasy of a mythical rape culture to validate their experience. I was threatened with a false sexual assault accusation freshmen year. You can't imagine the fear unless you've experienced it yourself, that there are people so devious and psychopathic as to threaten you with lies about rape. She didn't do it at the end. Thank god. But now I can feel my blood boiling whenever I hear people preaching about the 1 in 5 bs. Poisonous, poisonous lies.."
302,2015-11-10 23:05:15,"This one goes out to my crazy suitemate: You're crazy. Please stop... seriously, stop being crazy. I tried to get along with you, then treat you with care, then treat you like the infant child you are, but I can't deal with the crazy. Nope. Nope. Nope."
303,2015-11-10 22:22:20,"I'm pretty sure I was more empathetic before medical school, and the drudgery and toxic culture of medicine has turned me into a jaded, hateful person. 9/10 patients I see are poor, uneducated and ungrateful. They most likely ate, drank, or smoked themselves to their death bed and they expect us to ooze sympathy out of every pore while we're sleep-deprived, stressed, and broke. I hate medical school for what it's done to me. But maybe this is who I really am."

305,2015-11-10 22:27:22,"I'm in love with my best friend, who is in love with someone else."
306,2015-11-10 22:18:24,"I've been disappointed that the WU People's History Disorientation Guide didn't have more of an impact on campus. I found it incredibly eye-opening and thought-provoking, but it seems like enthusiasm/interest has largely died out since it was published."
307,2015-11-10 21:17:25,"In the spirit of squirrel pics, here's a lil guy I saw mistakenly recycling a piece of pizza outside Shepley."
308,2015-11-10 21:39:26,"I am all for fighting for change when it comes to sexual assault. When I heard the green dot training was going down, I was happy that something is being done; however, I did have a question about it: one statistic said that 63.5% of undergrads has witnessed a drunk person headed for a sexual encounter and that ~74.9% of students did nothing. While I am not trying to make a value judgement, what is the goal? For students to never have a sexual encounter with someone else when drunk because they technically can't give consent, or for someone to make sure they are fine before they hook up with someone? Is it inherently bad for someone to have a drunken hookup or are we all trying to fight for those survivors who obviously couldn't give consent? Any clarification would be greatly appreciated!"

311,2015-11-10 21:36:32,MFW people get offended over the things like coffee cups:
312,2015-11-10 21:07:34,"I love reading Wash U Confessions, and I wish they were posted more often!"
313,2015-11-10 21:33:35,"I refuse to use the pronoun ""they"" as a singular. I don't care if it's technically correct English. My mouth, my choice."
314,2015-11-10 21:25:37,My boyfriend and I want to do a threesome. Any takers?
315,2015-11-10 20:09:38,"I'm a guy and I hate rape culture, but not for the first reason you'd expect. Of course, I'm just as much against rape as the next person; anyone who does that to another human being deserves a punishment the darkest of minds can't concoct. I'm talking some serious medieval stuff or something. And to the victims, I don't mean to be selfish when I make my own personal complaint; my issue doesn't hold a candle to yours and I respect you for being the strong individuals you are. But I digress. 

To no one's fault but those guilty, the ubiquity of rape on this campus has made more people feel fear to falling victim. In turn, their fear has inspired fear in me when it comes to hitting on women. At a time, I did pretty well for myself socially. It use to be a numbers game; you play nice and eventually someone matches you, no shame in failing a few times. But now, you just can't get rejected without coming off as creepy, and with word spreading fast, I can't take the pressure of hurting my image like that. Seriously, I've digressed to my middle school self not knowing what to say because I want to be sure I don't overstep any boundaries. On top of it, I worked my ass off to get here, and while I treat women the best I can, I'm still in constant fear of my actions landing me in a courtroom. 

Bottom line, when it comes to hitting on women, I've become a huge pussy because of rape culture. So to the perves and predators out there, screw you guys. You're like the 14 year old who passes out in the port-a-potty at a tailgate, and gets tailgates banned for the entire university. Seriously, I know admin has to censor me, but fuck you."
316,2015-11-10 20:02:40,"I was talking with someone today about politics, and she just straight up stated that we should repeal the First Amendment. I think that's the first time in my life that my jaw has actually dropped. I just quit talking and walked away."
317,2015-11-10 12:50:41,I'm a non-Chinese Asian student in two different classes where almost 80% of the students are Chinese and already 4 times someone in those classes talked to me in Mandarin.
318,2015-11-10 12:22:42,"Finally matched with a non-robot on Tinder today, but it turns out it was an accidental swipe and I immediately was unmatched. -_-"
319,2015-11-10 12:13:43,"Before I transferred to Wash U, I was raped. My university at the time strongly pressured me not to go to the police, attempting to give me platitudes about how it would be easier to deal with in house. I chose to go to the police instead. Was it stressful, possibly traumatic? Yes. But what was worth more? My comfort through the investigation? Or the knowledge that I was protecting possibly hundreds of people from going through what I did? As for my rapist, he's now in jail. Had I chosen not to go to the police, he would still be on the streets, taking advantage of others."
320,2015-11-09 19:08:45,"I constantly hear and read about how people feel like they are giving into depression or stress, and it seems like everyone I know has gone through periods such as these. I try to relate, I really do, but I've never felt like that before. Don't get me wrong, I've been stressed, but it's typically about some assignment or test or something similar that as soon as I manage to finish it, the stress is relieved. I know that it's a good thing that I don't have depression or anxiety or the like, but sometimes I feel bad that I haven't when it seems as if everyone else has. 

I was dating a girl this summer who is literally the nicest person I have ever met. I found out a little while into the relationship that she had depression, has contemplated suicide and used to cut herself. I was absolutely shocked. She kept telling me that she appreciated how much I understood her and how well I could comfort her, but truthfully, I really couldn't understand. I've always tried to be optimistic, and that's the attitude I was presenting to her. I know I shouldn't, but that is what really makes me feel bad about never having those emotions before. 

Why is it fair that the sweetest person I know has to have experienced that while I get to coast through life without ever experiencing these traumas that seem so common?"
321,2015-11-09 19:26:48,"My grandma calls Wash U 'Little Birmingham', because whenever she visits, she only sees people hanging out in mono racial groups. It reminds her of growing up in Alabama."

323,2015-11-09 12:47:52,"The other night my boyfriend was really drunk. I was trying to assess how bad it was so I asked him ""Who am I?"". Without missing a beat he responded ""2 - 4 - 6 - 0 - 1!"" Apparently you're never too drunk to sing Les Mis."
324,2015-11-09 10:39:53,Rumors say that WashU brought hawks to control the number of squirrels on campus.
325,2015-11-09 10:27:55,"As an asexual person, it's always been pretty jarring to me to hear other people speak of sex as such a prized and important thing. I confess I just don't understand what the big deal is about (and yes, I have had sex before and while it was nice, I could honestly take it or leave it)."
326,2015-11-09 02:56:56,"I think it's problematic that wash u confessions is allowing picture submissions--if there are pictures of people, we can't trust the OP so i encourage the admin to be very skeptical"
327,2015-11-09 01:44:57,"Liking the new interface. I wanted to try uploading a picture, so here is a squirrel with a ritz cracker I saw on campus the other day.

330,2015-11-08 23:53:12,"My suitemates throw a lot of parties using our common room without telling the rest of us beforehand, so I never realize I should study for midterms somewhere other than my room until it's too late. It's gotten to a point where I've mapped out an escape route involving climbing out my room's window. I haven't done it yet, nor do I hope I ever have to, but I'd be lying if I said I didn't want to."
331,2015-11-08 23:31:14,"My mom told me my 8 months in outpatient drug rehab took 5 years off of my dad's life. He's older, and I did the math using estimates based off of my family history. My children are never going to know the man I most look up to in this world because of me."

341,2015-11-08 11:24:32,"WTF????

Based on the Wash U confessions, one would think that we are all a bunch of depressed, socially awkward losers.

Let's post up some juicy random sex confessions.

I'll start.  I got pegged and I liked it."
342,2015-11-08 01:01:34,"I was going to go to Princeton until I saw how little they gave me in financial aid.

Though I'm mostly over it now and very happy at Wash U, a small part of me died inside when so many of the Princeton students visited here this weekend.

I know my attachment to that school is 100% because of name and prestige and I feel like such an entitled asshole for feeling the way that I do (and it's maybe true)."
343,2015-11-08 01:49:35,"I confess that I sometimes feel a bit disappointed in people around me. I am a really competitive / ambitious person, and early on I realized that people don't really like that so I always tried to hide my competitive side. It is a bit disappointing to me that I cannot show the true me to my friends / have to hide it / nobody really understands my ambition.

Good thing is that now I gradually became more comfortable with the tiger within me and sometimes I show it to scare people :)"
344,2015-11-08 01:58:37,"I'm faceblind and bad at names and I always feel like an asshole when I forget who someone is. If I do it to you I promise it's not an insult to you personally, I just don't always recognize people out of the context I normally see them in."
345,2015-11-08 00:12:38,I'm a senior and I'm really scared about the future. A lot of people already have grad/med school acceptances or job offers. But my future is so unknown right now and that scares me. I've always known what my next step was. I'm very nervous but I'm also trying to stay positive.
346,2015-11-08 00:07:40,"Sometimes when I'm in a conversation, I find people just start saying random things, or when the conversation comes to an end, they'll  repeat something they said earlier to try and revive it. It's like they're afraid of silence, like not saying anything when you're with another person is some stigma. But silence isn't a bad thing. It gives you a chance to think of something meaningful to say, and it's much more awkward trying to force a conversation than it is to be silent for a while."

359,2015-11-07 20:10:11,"At the beginning of the summer as I was finishing up my workout, I saw a guy walk in the AC. I'm assuming that was his first time there - he was pretty small, having trouble benching just the bar, couldn't even do a single squat, and had an embarassed expression as he glanced at the guys around him lifting. I walked out to go home and didn't think much of the encounter at the time, but he became a familiar face in the weight room over the next few weeks. I still see him come in a couple times every week near the end of my workout. He's gotten a little (but noticeably) bigger, I see him squatting nearly two plates on each side now, and I see no trace of the self-consciousness that he had 6 months ago. 

I don't know your name, but I would like to shake your hand for taking the initiative to improve your body and not giving up when you were intimidated by those who could lift 5 times more than you.

This is a great example for anyone else who doesn't think they can become fit, or are afraid of being judged while exercising. Plus, most of the strangers in the gym either too busy to judge or even silently cheering you on - those who are actually judging you, screw them who cares what those assholes think. Just dedicate an hour three times a week, eat right, find the right program, ask friends for help, and you won't believe how much your life can change in a few months."

362,2015-11-07 19:43:15,"When I first came here I really hated it not going to lie. Seeing all my friends at state schools having the time of their lives while I was in my room every night doing homework sucked, especially because as a pretty introverted person it seemed like I was kinda stuck in a never ending cycle. But I have to say, these past few weeks everything has been getting better.

Writing this one for all the other students out there who were in my position, don't sulk and regret that you're here working all the time. You have to force yourself to be happy, and when you're happy, good things start happening to you and you'll find yourself climbing out of the hole you thought you were in. Just be free and happy and there's nothing that can bring you down."

364,2015-11-07 19:09:21,"I don't have anything against greek life or the people in it, it just seems lame.  In my opinion, there seems to be cooler things to do outside of the boring repetitiveness that greek life offers.  The one thing I think greek life does offer is convenience, convenience with test sharing, getting rides, having people to hang out with if you haven't made your own plans, people to pass down housing to you, (and even making friends), which is certainly nothing to scoff at.  However, outside of this admittedly very helpful convenience, greek life doesn't seem to have a lot going for it."

It was definitely traumatic for both parties involved."
366,2015-11-07 17:25:24,"I honestly think greek life is the worst part of this school. While I'm sure it's a great way for some people to make lifelong friends, I find it to be extremely divisive on campus. I'm a sophomore who rushed a couple times and just didn't find a group of guys I genuinely fit in with or wanted to spend the rest of college with. I thought not being a part of greek life wouldn't be a big deal but it's been detrimental to my social life. Whenever I want to hang out with people on the weekends they can't because they have ""mixers"" or ""date parties."" Going out isn't fun anymore because all the bars and frat parties are overrun by fraternities and sororities who all know each other and only want to mingle with themselves. I want to establish a group of friends to spend time with but even in the clubs and organizations I'm involved in everyone seems to prioritize their sorority or fraternity friends over everything else."

368,2015-11-06 23:34:26,"As an alum I confess that despite graduating with an Undergraduate and Masters degree from WashU and two years later being back home in rural United States, working for $16/hr manufacturing and setting head stones (yes, I make and put fancy rocks on dead people), side hustling as a farmhand during harvest (I'm sitting in a tractor at 10:30 pm on a Friday night unloading corn as I type this), I've never been happier and more satisfied with my life.

I'm close to family and I'm married to an amazing woman whom I never would've met if it wasn't for my $105,000 student loan debt (a small price to pay).

Sometimes, I wonder how my life would've been different if all of my grandiose plans during my school years came to fruition. Somehow I don't think I would be nearly as satisfied as I am now.

Moral of the story: Don't stress. Even if you don't get the GPA you wanted, the job you wanted, the grad school you wanted, you still can be happy! Happier than you ever imagined!

TL:DR: Even if things don't work out how you had planned, you can still be happy!"

No one did. I was curious, so later I Googled them, and it turns out I only actually made up one of them."
375,2015-11-05 21:17:38,"As someone who worked very hard to earn my spot in the business school, and someone who continues to struggle with my classes, I find it very discouraging when people say ""b school pre-school"" or imply that because I'm in the business school I don't have a lot of work or hard classes. Just an FYI: My classes are not easy. Sure, they aren't Gen Chem or Orgo, but they still challenge me and require a lot of effort to stay on top of them. I have the same amount of class time as most other students-- just because I don't have business classes on Fridays doesn't mean I get a ""day off."" I chose a major in the business school because I wanted to be able to help my parents support my other siblings through college. I also just really enjoy it and it's a career I can see myself pursuing, just like many of you wish to be doctors, lawyers, artists, or professors.

When people bash on my school, imply that my major is easy, and say I should be getting A's in all my classes, it's discouraging. We go to a really freaking difficult school, guys. Let's just accept the fact that we all worked hard to be where we are today and that we all chose different things to major in and leave it at that."

I suppose I also have to make a confession. It was raining heavily after a Calc exam review session my freshman year. When I walked outside my glasses got all fogged up and covered with water so I couldn't see very well. A girl who must have also been the review session started walking next to me. We started a conversation and she obviously knew me (she called me by my name).  We had a wonderful talk on our way back to the South 40. I was shy my freshman year, but she was so friendly that my social awkwardness didn't kick in.

At the end of the conversation I asked what her name was since I couldn't see very well. She seemed hurt by this question and just walked away. I still don't know who she was. I hope she reads this and realizes I asked that question because I couldn't see her face through my foggy glasses and not because she was a forgettable person. I still remember her years later during my Senior year. I'm sorry."

Please don't be afraid to give up that time, in fact don't look at it as ""giving up time"".

406,2015-10-29 00:19:40,"There's two parts, one is a confession one is a question for you, admin!

Confession:
I consistently struggle with wondering whether I deserve to be here, or whether I've gotten to a place like WashU because of factors outside of my control (my parents' ability to pay for my college, my upper middle class background, opportunities I was given that other people weren't given.) That doesn't mean I don't work hard, but I always wonder how much of my success is because of my hard work, but because of winning a genetic lottery. And it sucks, because the sad truth is that a good education is something everyone should have access to and it seems unfair that I have access to a great education for factors outside of my control, which will then just perpetuate the cycle.

Question for you, admin: If I'm interested in reaching out to run this page when you retire next semester, what should I do? I like the direction that you've taken WashU confessions this past year, with increased transparency about what does and doesn't get posted and more importantly why you do and do not post certain confessions. I'd like to continue the work you do, I think something like WashU Confessions does really add to the community."

I go to the gym a lot. This is anonymous, so there's no reason to boast, but I'd like to think that at this point--after a lot of hard work over the past few years--I'm one of the ""fit guys"" in the weight room. So here's my confession:

If you're overweight, weenie-thin, or new to fitness... I *want* you in the gym. I *want* you to take up space on the oly platform. Heck, make me wait my turn for the squat rack! Every single person in that gym, even that guy who makes muscle-ups look easy, started with baby weights. Nobody knows ""gym stuff"" from birth, and we're all continuously learning. If I see you in the gym, I'm mentally cheering you on--and honestly, I'll bet most of the other ""fit people"" in the gym are too. We want you to succeed! Just by going to the gym, you're doing something harder and braver than most people ever do, and that's rad.

I don't mean to erase your feelings, #3572. If you're afraid of going to the gym, that's valid, and real, and okay. But for what it's worth...you're strong, and you're awesome, and I want you to kick ass. You have people in your corner. :)"

I have known these people for 3 years, we have a ton of memories together and I love them, so this is not a hate speech against them. I really want to understand something.

We all are getting a great education at WashU that most people on earth can't afford. We are taught about global issues, philosophy, we learn logic, reasoning and critical thinking. After all that why would any of us want to vote for Donald Trump? Have we not heard the stuff he says? I understand if a 70 year old racist grandpa supports him, or if a person who is ignorant about politics, or someone with vested interest supports him. But why would an intelligent college student want Donald Trump as their next president? Is it because what he says feeds your inner monster and brings out the worst in you?

About Ben Carson, why would you want a person who wants a Christian nation? Aren't we all granted freedom of religion by the Constitution? Are the church and the state not separate as defined by the constitution? I am a liberal and I really want to have an honest and open conversation about this with anyone interested. I want to understand where the other side is coming from, bypassing all the hate and name-calling. Peace and love, ya'll!"

I feel like I don't have time to work out. Or when I do have time, I'm too tired. I'm also afraid of going to the gym because I'm overweight. I don't want people to look at me and judge me. I know people on campus here are proud of being ""fit"".

I'm just a freshman who is having a really rough time getting my shit together."
426,2015-10-25 02:17:24,"My suite-mates and I went out to the Loop for dinner on Saturday and on our way to the restaurant, we came across a homeless man in a wheelchair asking for some bus fare. As we passed by, we didn't pay much attention to him at all, but I noticed. I made sure to order another of the same meal I had that night to-go so I could give it to him on our way back. So I did.

When I gave the man the meal I'd bought for him, he was very thankful and gracious. He again asked me for some bus fare, but I told him the meal was all I had for him that night. He gave me a fist pound and thanked me as I left. As I turned by back to the man, I see a police car drive up next to the curb where the man was. The police officer quickly put the car in park, and hopped out of his patrol car with his flashlight. I was a bit ahead, so curiously I stopped for a second to see what was up. The cop turned his focus straight to the man in the wheelchair as he was beginning to open the brown bag of food I had just given him. The man started pointing at me from down the sidewalk and holding both his hands in the air. The cop looked over at me and the walked away from the man in my direction. I asked the cop if everything was alright, and with a disheveled and almost pissed off look said ""yeah, yeah"", so I just turned and kept walking with my suite-mates again.

It was only after my suite-mates had told me that I realized the cop might have thought it was a ""drug deal"" of some sorts. I felt foolish for a second, then angry. Not angry because I'd done something wrong, but angry because this man had to go through that.

Up until this point, I hadn't mentioned that this man was black. I bet you might have guessed. But assuming based on a person's situation or race should not be something that we hold our actions to. Just because of this man's disposition, he was a target of the officer's inquiry. I for one was not, even though the officer saw me hand the man the brown bag.

Is it fair to say that this encounter opened my eyes to what it must feel like? Yes. Is it okay to make this about race?  I don't know. But what I do know is that no person, of any race, religion, color, belief, or what-have-you should be treated with such suspicion as this man was.

""The earth is but one country and mankind its citizens."""
427,2015-10-25 01:32:25,I hate how people make going to WILD synonymous with getting wasted. I know plenty of people who went just to have a fun time and did so without drinking.
428,2015-10-25 00:26:26,I can't decide if I detest alcohol culture or the fact that I'm left out of it.

433,2015-10-23 22:49:35,"As a senior, this is the first WILD I've gone to drunk and I had so much fun, yet I'm also glad I went sober the years before because I wasn't ready to drink."
434,2015-10-23 15:34:37,If you are typing like a bird nipping on a concrete..... GET THE FUCK OUT OF THE  OLIN LIBRARY
435,2015-10-23 15:25:38,"So in all seriousness, do most people have fun at wild or do they just go because its the thing to do?

It feels like (most)beer: it leaves a kind of bad taste in your mouth but everyone else is doing it and it seems like some non-zero % of them are genuinely liking it."
436,2015-10-23 10:42:40,"Here's to all of us who aren't WILD people: whether you get anxious in large crowds of people or you have a history of substance abuse or you choose not to drink for whatever reason or you don't like concerts or you don't feel like a part of the campus community or you don't have friends to go with or it's just not your thing. It's okay. I hope you join me in practicing some self care and getting off campus, forgetting anxieties, and knowing that there's life beyond WILD."
437,2015-10-23 10:28:41,"I hate my mind. I could not go minutes without thinking about sex while studying for my exam that I had yesterday, but now, now that I am done with exams for a week, I have 0 sex drive. WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?"

441,2015-10-21 16:48:48,"Last week, I sold cocaine to a pregnant girl. There isn't anyway to tell what I would do for money. But I'm not just any drug dealer; Im a life saver."
442,2015-10-20 23:19:49,I lie to my parents every weekend about going to church because it would break their hearts to know how much I can't stand it. I'm worried about how little constantly lying bothers me.
443,2015-10-20 23:11:52,"I try really hard not to stereotype greek men and women. But living on frat row, enjoying my umpteenth Tuesday night rave makes me wonder how some of these people are still at WashU. Bass doesn't exactly make for great white noise."
444,2015-10-20 22:57:53,"I was cooking just now, and had to cut up a hot pepper as part of the recipe. I didn't handle it with gloves. A little later after cooking I touched my balls. Holy shit do they burn."

Caring.

448,2015-10-19 09:25:58,To the Indian guy running the Olin research study on Friday - you can whisper instructions in my ear any time
449,2015-10-19 09:05:11,"I have a genuine question. Obviously it is not ok to judge someone as attractive or not based on their weight. Although some people do this, it is considered  socially unacceptable. However, I often hear  people (oftentimes girls) say things along the lines of, ""I refuse to date someone who is shorter than me."" Why is it socially acceptable to judge people based on something that they have literally no ability to change?"
450,2015-10-19 09:33:12,"I watched Tarzan the other day, and it solidified what I've been thinking recently.  If you don't know, homeboy gets raised by Gorillas, runs around in a loin cloth, collects a hot British wife, and ends up swinging around on vines, eating, and boning Jane.

Watching it, I realized how great he had it.  Eat, sleep, sex, repeat.  No bills, no bullshit responsibilities, just taking care of the fundamentals.

Unfortunately, we're precluded from living that life style.  We're born into an inescapable society that's run on money, and we'll be here until we die.  I'm not really going anywhere with this, I just think humanity would probably be a lot happier if we had stuck with the hunter-gatherer life.  If I were to ask you, at any given moment, if you were happy, you'd probably (if you were being honest) say no."
451,2015-10-17 15:33:14,"I hate when people at Whispers leave their trash on the table for others to clean up. But it's even more frustrating to see new people sit down and push the trash out of their way instead of actually throwing it out, and it just stays there until someone takes action or a worker goes out of their way to do it. Please just be respectful from now on and throw your stuff away."

453,2015-10-17 15:19:20,"After visiting Europe this summer, I can easily say that the US ain't got shit on it when it comes to racism. The way people talk about Jewish people, Polish people, and Romanian people is disgusting."
454,2015-10-17 02:47:21,Getting myself to go to bed at a normal hour (it's currently 1:15am and I have to be at work at 8:30am) is like trying to write a final paper more than 1 day in advance.

459,2015-10-17 02:54:28,The culture of shitting on long-distance relationships is so annoying.  Not everything is for everyone. Let me live my life please n thanks
460,2015-10-14 21:28:29,"It disgusts me that students at WashU are obsessed with proving how miserable they are. On a daily basis, WashU students love comparing how much work they have and wallowing in how difficult the classes are. On WashU Confessions, I've noted a recent trend of WashU students trying to prove that they aren't as rich as everyone thinks they are. Bro, if you aren't working 40 hours a week or trying to make money off CL ads because your parents deposit money in your account every month-- maybe just be thankful for what you have and stop being upset that everyone isn't recognizing how hard it is for your parents to send three kids to a tier 1 school? If your parents can afford that in the first place, then yes-- you are well off in comparison to most of the American public. There's nothing wrong with that. And yet... For some reason, students here are just obsessed with proving that their life is a struggle.

My confession? My life is fucking great. I work 40 hours a week, get good grades, don't complain about my work, do too many drugs for my own good, and I'm fucking happy. You all should try it some time instead of being pissed that people aren't recognizing how hard your life is as a college student at a top school in the nation."
461,2015-10-14 21:50:32,"Dear freshmen in my physics class:  SHUT THE FUCK UP WHEN THE PROFESSOR IS TALKING.  This isn't high school, and I'm trying to listen to the lecture that I went into serious debt to pay for."

My sister and all of my friends have all gone on Birthright and I've just been waiting to have enough time to take off the 10 days and just go.

466,2015-10-13 22:22:40,I accidentally celebrated no bra day when I took off my bra in the library at  3 am last night. I must admit that part of the reason I don't study more in the library is cause I don't want to have to wear a bra.
467,2015-10-13 22:54:41,"At the beginning of this semester, I decided to challenge myself. Whenever I found myself wanting to say ""that offends me,"" I started mentally rephrasing it to ""I take offense at that.""  And you know what? That small switch to taking responsibility forced me to think about why I was taking offense at things, clarified my views, and helped me to realize that if someone can offend you, they have power over you. It's probably been one of the most empowering decisions of my life."

472,2015-10-13 20:29:49,To the guy who helped me untangle my bike the other day: thank you. With two people the job went way more quickly and you were the only one who even offered. I owe you one!
473,2015-10-13 20:22:52,"I'm debating breaking up with my boyfriend. He only seems happy to be with me every couple of weeks, and rarely makes much of an effort. I can't change how he feels. If he doesn't feel the need to try maybe the relationship is already over..."

476,2015-10-12 21:21:56,"Not that I expect you to post this, but fuck [redacted].  I hate how WashU Confessions is frequently besieged by commenters who clearly have no connection to the school, and only a slew of (evidently negative) stereotypes to go on, e.g. ""arrogant rich kids who have no idea how good they have it, and have no idea what it's like to struggle/be unhappy etc.""  

I mean, obviously WashU is full of the scions of wealthy families, but that in no way means that their grievances are less legitimate, or that their suffering is any less painful.  As anyone with boatloads of money can tell you, money doesn't buy happiness, and while you can buy things to make you happy, the happiness derived from material possessions is relatively transient, and is more or less the same whether you're a Saudi prince buying a $300 million yacht, or the local drug dealer with some shiny rims (and don't worry, the former is more morally reprehensible than is the latter; this isn't a case of latent racism)."
477,2015-10-12 19:54:57,"It bothers me so much that people think art school students have it easier than everyone else. Yes, maybe we're not math geniuses or nearly as good at Science as the premed kids, but we work hard in our fields, our own way. People need to stop having these comparisons between schools, we're all here to learn. You're not the only one thats stressed out"

479,2015-10-12 17:32:11,"People have this strange assumption that if one of your parents or both happen to be a doctor, you're automatically well off. Life isn't like that, especially when you have 3 siblings in college and these colleges and the government have the same view as the people who assume that you're well off because you have a physician parent. College tuitions and taxes add up and with federal loans not being an option, we are not ""rolling in it"". You can have a physician parent and have your house mortgaged as we do. Life isn't as easy as the cover may make it seem."
480,2015-10-12 17:28:12,"Sometimes I wonder about whether you pay for a better education by attending Wash U. As opposed to attending a public school or cheaper private, it's hard to believe that you learn substantially more. Rather it seems as if you're paying for the Wash U name and the prestige and networking opportunities that come with it"

485,2015-10-12 01:01:22,"I confess that I am the luckiest guy on earth. I have the love of an amazing girl and I want to shout it to the world. She amazes me every day, she is perfect, she completes me. True love does exist. I have experienced it."

489,2015-10-12 01:07:28,"I'm really struggling with deciding whether I believe in God or not. I've been raised a Christian my entire life, but now that I'm in college and am not being forced to go through the motions, I've been trying to figure out what I personally believe and it's really scaring me because I'm afraid of choosing wrong. I don't know who to talk to because everyone I know seems to be firm in their beliefs."
490,2015-10-12 01:58:29,"Just a note to all of you out there like me, scrolling through your newsfeed and looking at all of your fb friends who are proudly coming out today or have been out for some time. You are not any less strong for not being out. You don't owe it to anybody else to come out. Your reasons for frolicking in Narnia or huddling with the coats are valid and I support you and your strength. I see you."

503,2015-10-12 01:06:52,"So I'm not sure if this is a confession or a soap box.

When i first came as a freshman, people were all pretty open about making new friends. As a sophomore, people were a little open.

As a Junior and senior, people seem to just stick to friend groups and don't really open up to making new friends and it kind of sucks since I never solidly settled into any friend group.

Seems like you have to either be in a club/team with people or it's simply people you knew since you were a sophomore."
504,2015-10-12 01:56:53,"Why do so many olin students not realize that the vast majority of MBAs and CEOs and business executives didn't go to an undergraduate business school? And by the way, no recruiters are impressed by your engraved plastic name tags."
505,2015-10-12 01:47:55,"As someone who's in a frat, i think wash u would be so much better without greek life.

506,2015-10-12 01:33:56,"When my parents came up for parents' weekend, my dad asked me a lot of questions about what I wanted out of life, whether I had accomplished anything substantial since coming here, etc, and tbh it really fucked up my headspace. I'm just a freshman and I know I have some time to make these decisions, but I feel so inadequate and useless. I've already been here 6 weeks and I haven't really achieved anything, and I'm terrified that I'm never going to. More than anything, I'm scared I'm going to slip back into depression, after I spent 4 years fighting to free myself from that constant apathy and self-loathing."
507,2015-10-12 01:18:57,One of my biggest fears regarding living by myself is the possibility of an ant infestation. It happened to one of my friends at her school and I am now terrified of the prospect of that happening to me

If it's already on, TURN IT OFF!!! If it's off, as said above, DO NOT TRY TO TURN IT ON!!!

I work at STS and have had way too many people come in that have tried to turn their computer on after spilling water on it, and sadly, most of the time there's nothing that can be done but mourn for their fallen companion, and I'll tell you why. By itself, when the device is off, water won't do anything to your electronics. If you dry it out completely and remove all of the water, in theory nothing will have happened. When it gets bad is when there's water still  in the device and you try to run a current through it (turn it on), it can create circuits between places where there shouldn't be and it can short out your device and then you're screwed.

Long story short, if you spill water on your computer or any other electronic device, the best thing to do is leave it powered off, and if it's not already, do that immediately and dry it out. If you don't know how to take your computer apart, or don't feel comfortable doing it yourself, just bring it over to us at STS as soon as possible and we can work from there. But if you try turning it on and things start going wrong, we'll still try our darndest, but there probably isn't a whole lot that can be done.

Anyways, sorry for the long post, but it's just a shame to see so many people have to buy new computers or lose their data when it could be prevented. As always, I hope we helped and have a great day."
603,2015-10-08 21:23:20,"Re: #3185 (Baby Carrots)

Is it just me, or do baby carrots taste exactly like regular carrots, except they are:

A) smaller
B) more expensive
C) terrible for our environment

Like, aside from the fact that baby carrots are directly linked with polar bear deaths, why would someone like them in the first place? I never hear someone say they like little sandwiches, they just like sandwiches... (Though, to be fair, mini m&ms are waaaaaaaay better than regular m&ms...)

Honestly, baby carrot are like Ultimate Frisbee players to me: Frisbee players pretend to play some cool niche sport, when it's really just either glorified handball or dumbed-down football (side note: the word ""Ultimate"" has no place in ""Ultimate Frisbee""). In the same vein, baby carrots pretend to be some special niche case of vegetable, when their just environmentally harmful carrots."

Everyone's experience is different of course, and I can't presume to know what, if anything, is best to say, so I'll just say this: I love you.

Arbitrary pretentious judgment like this is my least favorite thing about this campus (not that it doesn't happen off campus as well, it's just exceptionally bad here). I'm tired of people assuming that the behaviors of others automatically prove their poor character.

611,2015-10-07 08:15:32,"Last year I was in an abusive relationship. In the depths of it, I felt despair and desperation that is indescribable. I felt like I couldn't be alive anymore. While on the phone with my parents one night, I began to have a panic attack. It went on and on, and they called my school. 

A team of EST showed up at my door and a girl knelt in front of me and began to walk me through some breathing exercises. There were 5 or 6 other people from EST crowded into my room, arguing about something else, and I must have been looking around wildly. The girl told me to look at her, and the pure, gentle kindness and concern in her face and demeanor helped me to calm down. When taking my sweater off to take my blood pressure, I saw her notice a bruise on my arm. I saw her expression and knew that she cared. After they determined I was suicidal, she made sure a female officer rode with me to the hospital. 

I probably wouldn't recognize her if I saw her today, because I was so panicky then, but I just wanted to find a way to thank her. The compassion and love she radiated in my darkest, most isolated time gave me some goodness to cling to, and I still remember it when I have hard days. I hope she sees this and knows I am so grateful."

613,2015-10-07 08:47:35,"I feel like I'm at the point in my life where I should have had at least one significant romantic relationship. I know it's dumb and I shouldn't need someone else to make me validated or loved, but sometimes I wonder if I'm missing out on something and why I'm missing out. Maybe it's just circumstances or maybe I sabotage myself, but I'm just starting to feel like I should just get comfortable being alone.

~that's all folks~"
614,2015-10-05 22:11:37,I really miss the class of 2015. Campus just feels dead without them.

616,2015-10-05 10:33:40,"I would feel safer on campus if we had more relaxed rules about carrying weapons. I know WUPD is armed, but if there is ever a situation on campus, how long would it take them to arrive?  I'd feel much better knowing that fellow students and teachers around me are there to protect their peers."
617,2015-10-05 10:24:41,"I don't know how I feel about Greek life philanthropy weeks. They help great causes and all, but I feel like they are very exclusive to the rest of the student body and makes it hard for non-greek people to participate in the ""fun"" events like the sports tournaments at the end of the week"
618,2015-10-04 14:07:42,"To everyone struggling (or even excelling) this midterm season - with stress, loss, anxiety, what have you.

I confess that life is worth living. Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's hard, and sometime's it's just horrific and it's difficult to put one foot in front of the other or even leave bed. Sometimes it feels like the world is shifting under your feet and any semblance of structure in your life is crumbling around you.

That's okay. That is life. But, let's take a step back.

Let's reclaim the day for ourselves. If that seems like too much, let's reclaim this hour, or the next ten minutes. Let's remind ourselves that today, even if we can only convince ourselves of it for a few minutes, life is beautiful. Despite papers and exams and feelings of loneliness or anxiety, let us claim today as a wonderful day where we will appreciate life's difficulties as something we are strong enough to surmount.

I believe in you. I believe that you are all strong enough to put one foot in front of the other, read one more page, work one more problem, keep going step by step until you have reached your goal.

Good luck to everyone in this midterm season. It might not be easy, but you can do it. You will persevere and it will eventually subside.

Good luck."
619,2015-10-04 11:47:43,I confess that all these confessions are getting dark as fuck.  Reply to this confession with your favorite joke.
620,2015-10-04 11:00:45,"Freshman year I went to Uncle Joes and called SARAH when I was having a really difficult time. For those of you also struggling, go to Uncle Joes.  They will point you in the direction of resources that can help support you. We are so lucky to have both of these resources available to us.... use them."

623,2015-10-03 15:48:52,"I think I was raped. I told him no but I had done other things with him and was pressured into it. It's kind of a blur...I don't think most of my friends will understand and the ones who do just want me to do something about it. I know I can talk to SARAH and other resources on campus, but I still have to go around for the majority of the day pretending everything is fine and being my usual happy, bubbly self. I have to pretend I'm fine with the rest of the world watching even though I'm crumbling."
624,2015-10-03 11:39:53,"I really want to go trick or treating this year. My parents only let me go a few times when I was younger, but were fairly strict about it. By the time I was in high school, they wouldn't let me because I was too old, even though most of my friends were going."
625,2015-10-03 09:41:55,"Fuck failing. It's all I've been doing lately (not intentionally) and I'm done with it. I don't care how little sleep I get or how many friends I lose, I'm done failing. I don't fail. Fuck it."
626,2015-10-03 09:13:56,"I've noticed that my roomate has been extremely stressed lately. She's an international student and really loves math, especially the beauty of proofs. But she feels like she isn't doing too well in the class. I tell her, like what all the professors say, college is the time to fail. She says that with all of the money that her parents are spending for her to come to WashU, she feels like she can't afford to fail. 

People don't realize that international students are here on a student visa, and thus cannot work under the law. With no financial aid and a high cost of living and transportation, internationals often must deal with the frustration of spending money but not being able to make any to alleviate their parents' burdens. I can always try to get a side job but she can't. Even though my roommate's parents tell her that her grades don't matter and that they are ok with whatever major she chooses, she feels an immense guilt. 

Her parents are spending so much money, and she can't guarantee an equal ""return"" on this investment in her education. She isn't guaranteed a job in her home country or here (due to an H1-B visa lottery system). Pursuing her ""passions"" might not be the most practical or soul-satisfying thing when this much money is at stake. 

We often see international students as part of exclusive ""cliques,"" unwilling to interact with us. They do face different problems that we, as citizens, may not have to stress about at all. But we all struggle sometimes here at WashU; empathy hopefully will make it just a little bit more bearable."
627,2015-10-03 01:58:57,"My father is working for an engineering company that's helping MacDonald's develop machines to replace the cashiers in store, and he tells me they've had some big breakthroughs recently. It's gonna be great not having my order screwed up all the time and also making the process more efficient. Plus it'll reduce costs for MacDonald's and (hopefully) their prices won't keep skyrocketing."
628,2015-10-03 01:42:58,"I never eat baby carrots because burning fossil fuels in order to cut a perfectly good carrot into a smaller AA-battery sized pellet is not only bad for the environment, but somehow means I have to pay more for less carrot!"
629,2015-10-03 01:24:11,"I'm sure there are some issues with WUPD, as there are with most institutions.  But I just want to thank the WUPD officers that have helped me personally.  I can't speak for everyone's experience but those I have interacted with have been very caring, kind, and understanding.  Their demeanor with students should be a model for police in communities everywhere.  Thank you WUPD!"

631,2015-10-01 15:06:14,"ally try to stay away from press, but Alex Siegman had a good heart for wanting to write this article about mental health. For those who aren't familiar, Alex had also recently written the viral article on Adjunct Professors.

It takes bravery to write an honest and personal article addressing mental health on a college campus like Wash U's, and he did a fantastic job. I think it will really resonate with a lot of people.

And Alex, thanks for the journalistic integrity. Much respect for you.

645,2015-09-27 16:55:38,My biggest regret in college is taking a Capella way too seriously.  It took me way too long to realize that people outside a Capella don't really care that much about it.
646,2015-09-27 01:17:40,"This may sound superficial as fuck, but one of the biggest regrets I have from college is not rushing. I'm a senior who's graduating this semester and even though I've had an amazing college experience, I think I would have truly benefited from joining a sorority. I had seriously considered it for a while, but decided not to for multiple reasons. I keep thinking about all the 'what ifs' and what my college experience would have been like had I rushed but I seriously need to stop thinking about it because it's a waste of time. So for all you underclassmen on the fence about sorority rush, I'd say give it a shot and if it's not for you then drop. Just live your life with no regrets."

651,2015-09-26 11:22:48,"I'd like to apologize to those who were hurt by my confession, 3135. I wanted to express that some, though definitely not all, of the students seem to speak to people in minimum wage jobs at a distance, with a friendliness that seems more forced than genuine. 

I more wanted to encourage people to actually get to know people working here instead of keeping them at a distance and only saying the obligatory hello how are you without caring much about the answer. I phrased it badly,though, and I apologize."
652,2015-09-26 11:54:49,"I don't know if I was sexually assaulted. I woke up after a black out night with a boy I've been hooking up with for months. I'm scared because I don't know what happened, but it's my fault so I can't say I was sexually assaulted. It was my fault."

Just because you are financially well-off does not entitle you to shitty behavior.  Yes, your tuition pays the wages of the maintenance workers, but that doesn't mean you get to make their jobs harder because you don't feel like throwing away your trash.  When you steal food, you make everyone else's meal plan more expensive.  When you steal paper, you make printing more expensive.  It's not about you, so start acting your age."

659,2015-09-25 10:39:11,"I'm a low income student from Saint Louis. I can honestly say that I have a better relationship and time with the workers here than I do some of my peers. I connect with them, they understand the struggle and they genuinely care for me as well. I'm friends with them on FB and they worry when they don't see me around.

My family isn't very involved with my college life and they make me feel as if I have a home away from home.

As a minority student there is not a large presence of people who look like me at Wash U. They are like family to me and it hurts that people just see it as a stunt. Very sad."
660,2015-09-25 09:26:12,"John works the brick fire oven station (over by the pizza) in bd. I chat with him every time I see him on shift there because he's friendly and somehow we just started talking last year. We inquire about how each other's day has been, he's told me about his kids and grandkids, I know he has adult-onset asthma that showed up in the past year and that he's quitting smoking to help ease that issue. I also know he had an asthma attack the other day and didn't have his inhaler, and when I saw him struggling through it to finish his shift at work, the concern I felt was real. The fear and not knowing how I could help when he assured me he'd be done in a few hours and would handle the asthma attack when he was home, that was all very genuine.

Maybe I'm greedy for seeking authentic, emotional connections with other people because they make me feel fulfilled, but I'm certainly not doing it to maintain some deceptive public appearance. (It's not like I'm running for president lol)"

662,2015-09-25 09:11:15,"I think as long as Wash U isn't a dry campus, there will be large numbers of people reporting unwanted sexual contact. Sex is another story, but I'm talking about stuff that's not quite intercourse. When you're drunk, you make choices you'll regret in the morning whether you're male or female. Not advocating prohibition, but maybe if you don't want to have regrets you shouldn't get blackout drunk. Obviously there are tragic cases where drinks are spiked, etc., but much of the time it's people drinking a ton, regretting what they did when they were drunk, and blaming people who were probably just as drunk."
663,2015-09-24 21:12:20,I think the people who think that having a brief conversation with campus workers is a stunt have probably not worked a day in their lives and thus cannot appreciate the value of common courtesy while on the job.
664,2015-09-24 21:31:21,When I was a pre-frosh I would try to suck up to current students to see if they could put in a good word for me at the admissions office.  I now realize that's not how it works.

673,2015-09-22 11:36:35,I think I'm in love with one of the Wash U Admissions Officers. I'm getting involved with admissions stuff just because I want an excuse to be there as often as possible.
674,2015-09-21 18:55:37,"I always wondered where the campus workers work during summer. If we are only here for 8 months a year, are they unemployed for the other 4 months? That would really suck."
675,2015-09-20 20:46:38,"This weekend I had an awesome conservation with the facilities staff. These are definitely the most underrated, but important parts of campus.

677,2015-09-20 20:32:41,"I am continually disappointed by the lack of respect WUSTL students have for sustainability initiatives on campus.  So many refuse to even take two minutes to learn the rules of waste collection.  Plastic utensils go in landfill!  Cardboard cereal containers are recyclable! None of us can make a difference alone, but together we can accomplish something and help our children's Earth, something that I hate to say our parents haven't done a very good job with either.  

Please, please, please take a minute just to think about why it is important to pay attention to all the little things that you can do to contribute to the cause of sustainability.  I know a lot of measures are a bit of an inconvenience, but they are nonetheless important, and you can help us, as a community, make a real difference."

I feel like it's too late now, but I'm not interested in casual hook-ups. I know that you don't have to be in a relationship to be happy, but I am tired of being alone when so many of my friends are in happy relationships."
681,2015-09-19 01:59:48,"I think I'm falling in love with a friend who lives in another state and doesn't go to WashU and I'm terrified. I would love to be with him but our positions make a relationship impossible. I'm scared that I'll get hung up on him and won't be able to have satisfying relationships at WashU, but I'm also afraid that I'll end up falling for someone here while still not having found closure with my friend."

685,2015-09-17 09:40:55,"I think it is pathetic how not diverse and how closely tied to Greek life Armour is. As a fashion space, it should demand diversity, especially from a school that has so much to offer. Instead, it has become a place for friends to take photos of one another and call themselves a Student Union group. The fact that my activities fee for the school year goes to funding friends parading around in expensive clothes that they can afford makes me sad and disappointed in our university. Fashion is not about the most expensive sunglasses you can buy; its about how you put together the things in your closet in a way that expresses yourself. Please Armour, take this into consideration the next time you choose your models, your writers, your articles,etc. to keep your publication relevant and worth the money I have put into funding you."

697,2015-09-13 00:52:25,"Honestly, I regret working so hard in life. I worked my way out of a shitty school district to WashU, found myself completely behind everyone else in terms of academics, did horribly my first semester, and then worked hard enough to get into the top 10-20% of GPA's in the b-school.

Now is the moment of truth, where the junior internships come rolling in. Now, I'm realizing that I'm going to get nothing. The charismatic, popular kids are going to get all of the internships that I want and I'm getting none of them.

I'm realizing that I could have just breezed through high school, gotten into a random state school, had a lot of fun, and been in the same situation."
698,2015-09-12 20:56:26,"I get the feeling people only care about me/want to hang out with me because of things that I have: alcohol, weed, connections to parties etc. but they don't actually care about hanging out with me, which is all I want. I guess I need to meet new people but it's just so hard."
699,2015-09-12 10:30:28,"Seeing #3098, what troubles me is the lack of initiative people at Wash U have. We see a problem, ask why it isn't being fixed, but then don't do our part to make that a reality. Be the change you want to see-- the reason we don't have an anti-ISIS club is because nobody has created one, including the submitter of the last post."
700,2015-09-12 10:01:29,I really wish there were more student groups dedicated to helping the victims of ISIS and providing support for refugees.  I don't think Wash U students are really aware of just how horrible things are over there.  This matters more than mozz sticks.
701,2015-09-11 22:25:32,"To the guy I made eye contact with multiple times who got a table for one at [restaurant] on the Loop tonight: I totally know how you feel, and I don't think I could ever go out on my own on a Friday night like that. Props to you, and know that you're not alone, even if you're literally alone."
702,2015-09-11 10:01:34,"Is there an outdoor pull-up bar on campus?
My guns need some work...okay a lot of work...fine, I've decided I want to be able to do a pull-up"

704,2015-09-11 10:34:37,"I'm a senior and I feel like a poser at this school. I try not to compare myself to people, but everyone else is just so brilliant and attractive. I'm glad it's my last year because I'm getting tired of constantly feeling this way."
705,2015-09-11 10:23:38,"I believe that I met my true love while at WashU.  Now that I and my love are both gone from school, despite my sadness and loneliness, I look back on our times very fondly.  Current and future students, I am so sorry that you will not get to feel the joys that I have felt.  Connie screwed you all. #savethemozzsticks"

707,2015-09-10 14:19:41,"Dear Freshmen,

Your time at WashU will be pretty fun, and I'm sure you've already been enjoying the various off-campus and fraternity parties (and even dorm parties) you've been invited too/showed up en mass when one person on your floor found out. Understand this very clearly: whether it's a fraternity house or an off-campus apartment, the people hosting are inviting you, complete and total strangers they will most likely never know, into their homes, where they live, work, study, and commune with friends. 

Not only did they invite you into their homes, but they are providing you with free alcohol and a place to dance and play games with your friends. That being said, STOP STEALING OUR SHIT. Every year, freshmen act like it's hilarious to steal perople's personal affects, the same people who have invited you into their homes. You might think ""Oh it's just a shot glass"", but that shit has sentimental value, a reminder of a family trip taken or time spent abroad. For the latter, those small trinkets are irreplaceable.

Sincerely,
Everyone who isn't one of you thieving bastards"
708,2015-09-09 21:57:42,It's very frustrating when I try to make new friends and then they forget who I am the next time we see each other

713,2015-09-09 16:17:52,"Just a message to freshmen: I hated my first 1.5 years here, and now I'm pretty happy. If you're happy at wash u now, great! If not, hang in there; it's not a competition and at the end you'll be grateful for having experienced it."
714,2015-09-09 16:16:53,How do people always seem to have someone to sit with during big lecture classes?  I'm one of those people who always ends up sitting with a different stranger each class.

722,2015-09-07 13:29:15,"All I want to do is the change the world. And I couldn't ask to be put in a better place to enable me to do this.

Ps. I fucking love all of you."

729,2015-09-07 00:05:28,I hate when I eat something and it feels like it is going to clog my servos

731,2015-09-06 23:50:32,I have no idea where i fit in socially here at Wash U. First few weeks have been somewhat stressful partly because I just don't know who I can have true deep interactions with. A lot of the people I've gotten to know the first few weeks of school are superficial..... How am I supposed to get through the next 9 months?
732,2015-09-06 23:39:34,I hate being a dinosaur
733,2015-09-06 23:26:35,"I have a tail and collar and really want to wear them around since I'm wolfdogkin and it helps me better connect, I guess you could say, but I know I will be made fun of and it really upsets me people actually do things like make fun of someone for wearing something that isn't the ""norm""."
734,2015-09-06 23:18:37,"I hate being polykin. The amount of kintypes I have is just... It makes me feel invalid, fake. I hate it."

736,2015-09-06 23:32:40,It's my 2nd year here and I don't think I'll ever find a community I fit into. I'm so sick of just sitting in my room on the weekends but I have nothing else to do and no one else to see.
737,2015-09-06 22:56:41,"So I have a steady long-distance boyfriend, whom I've been with for four to five years now. I've never been with anyone else. Is it bad that I sometimes wonder...? There's this guy here on campus who I really like/have a slight crush on. I feel guilty for even thinking it, but I just wish I could have more experiences with other guys."

739,2015-09-06 22:45:43,"Last night I let one of my friends mix a drink for me. It was one solo cup's worth that very obviously had soda in it and yet I got so drunk that I was still having vision problems 3 hours later. He told me there was only one shot in my cup. It tasted like more but I thought that was because I hadn't had a drink in awhile.

 I don't know what he gave me, but I think if I hadn't called my boyfriend when he left the room for a second he would have raped me. The guy I dated for most of freshman year physically abused me, and as a junior now I'd finally convinced myself I'd gotten over it to the point where I could trust guys again. Last night destroyed that. 

I don't know what I'm going to do about my friend or my relationships with guy friends. I also don't know how I'm going to survive class today because I feel horrible. Wish me luck!"
740,2015-09-06 22:43:45,I'm a bisexual freshman who's still in the closet and seeing all of these cute guys on campus is driving me insane. Girls are awesome but I really miss feeling another man's body. I don't even want a relationship. I'm just really sexually frustrated and even madder that I can't do anything about it. :(
741,2015-09-06 22:13:48,"Everyone here is sooo attractive and smart and talented, and I'm...just not. I'm thrilled to have the opportunity to study at WashU but I can't help but feel a little insecure about myself when looking at my peers..."

744,2015-09-06 22:34:53,"I'm a freshman and I feel really overwhelmed. Or underwhelmed. I don't know. Wash U wasn't my first choice, but it was up there, and now that I'm here I can't help feeling like it wasn't a good match, like somehow I don't deserve it or it doesn't deserve me. I've set goals that I can strive for here and people seem really cool and I've been happy with pretty much everything I've done so far, so I'm not sure what's causing this feeling. :("
745,2015-09-06 21:03:55,Today during one of my classes a fellow student took their shoes and socks off as class began. I couldn't focus at all the rest of class. Please have some respect for your fellow classmates and don't do this. You're hurting other's education because of your selfish behavior.
746,2015-09-06 21:10:56,Being a girl with a high sex drive is hard; all I want is a boyfriend who is willing to have sex once or twice a day. I guess that's too much to ask for...
747,2015-09-04 09:44:57,I graduated in May and seeing all of the posts on here makes me incredibly wistful and sad. I'd give anything to be back at WashU.
748,2015-09-03 14:23:58,"I really want to know what supporters of Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders are on, because it sound like the good stuff and I'd like some for my next party."
749,2015-09-03 14:35:11,"I get irrationally angry with people who chew with their mouths open and slurp their food. Like, if I have to listen to it for too long, I get so irritated that I want to punch them in the face. (And yes, I realize it's a bit ethnocentric of me because in Asia slurping noodles and soup shows that you are enjoying your food. I can't help it that the sound disgusts me.)"
750,2015-09-03 10:11:12,"Sometimes I have class with people who I've unmatched on Tinder, and I REALLY hope they don't remember my face."
751,2015-09-02 08:51:14,Anyone else at WashU obsessed with Fairy Tail? I have no one but the internet to talk to about it.
752,2015-09-02 08:29:15,"Look, freshmen, if your professor can't teach well, give him constructive criticism in a mature manner. There's no fucking reason why you should attack him on a personal level. Do you really need to laugh and belittle his physical appearance, clothing choice, or roll your eyes when he pauses for a few seconds before speaking because English isn't his first language? Do you really need to sneer and scoff at his every movement? Does it make you feel cool when you Snapchat photos of him teaching with snarky captions to your friends? 

NEWSFLASH: you look like an asshole when you make fun of your teachers to gain your peers' approval. And, you're ruining the learning environment for those who actually want to pay attention. This isn't high school anymore. Please get your shit together, because the next time I hear you whine I will literally chuck my ancient, 14-pound graphing calculator right at your head."
753,2015-09-01 18:19:20,"I'm a freshman and it really sucks not having a group of friends yet. I wish I knew around what time people started meeting their ride-or-dies because at this point, I feel like the only person who has to eat alone everyday."
754,2015-09-01 18:13:21,Does anyone else go to class and hope that it isn't the lecture where you stop understanding what's going on in the course?
755,2015-08-30 10:12:22,I wish that someone had told me that the best way to survive the activities fair is to not look anyone directly in the eyes.
756,2015-08-29 10:24:24,"All these girls gettin' dressed up and goin' out and I'm just like lol I just drove to Schnucks to get a pint of Ben & Jerry's, which I will consume in its entirety tonight while reading The Fellowship of the Ring. So."
757,2015-08-27 15:39:25,I'm legitimately sad that Wash U Admirer's doesn't post :(
758,2015-08-27 01:43:26,I'm tired of the stigma attached to being a virgin. Why do men have to question why I'm a virgin when I tell them? I know that it's okay to be a virgin but I still feel bad hearing my friends talk about their sexual experiences while I have nothing to contribute. I shouldn't let something like this get me down but I feel like I need to lose my virginity before I graduate or else.
759,2015-08-26 18:00:28,"For real though, how do I get myself a girlfriend? I'm such a lonely senior."
760,2015-08-26 18:00:29,"I was seriously considering becoming a WGSS major. But over the summer, a friend of mine showed me a bunch of interviews with high muckety-mucks in the field where they flat out ignore the results of rigorous scientific studies, and stating that their opinions and feelings were more important than science. I can't in good conscience continue in a field that ignores facts when it's convenient."
761,2015-08-26 17:38:32,"Hey kiddos, take advantage of all your friendship-promoting resources you have at a fine school like this. Like clubs. and living near people. and being within walking distance of everyone and everything. Going to places where peers will always be, whispers, the DUC, BD, Seoul Taco etc. I used to have real life friends, like people I know, who know me, that I could say hi to and stuff. And then I graduated and moved, new job, no friends in the world outside of it. oh well."
762,2015-08-25 19:25:34,"The beginning of sophomore year has made me realize how terrible my freshman year was. Freshmen, remember that it will get better!"
763,2015-08-25 16:00:35,I really want Louis C.K. or Kevin Hart to perform at WashU but I feel like people would get way too offended.
764,2015-08-25 08:42:37,WashU Admirers needs to start back up...
765,2015-08-25 08:35:38,"I'm a sophomore, and I feel like I still haven't found my place here. I have very few friends and every student group I've been interested in has either rejected me or turned out to not be what I was looking for. I could stand this feeling last year, but now I can't take it anymore."
766,2015-08-24 23:51:40,"I think the new eco-to-go system is going to backfire horribly. Is it really to-go if you have to take it back? Like, how is it any different from a plate? Plus you have to wait in line to get it swiped back in. I think people are just going to steal plates. Big mistake, dining services. There's a reason to-go boxes exist."
767,2015-08-24 20:07:41,"For everyone out there looking for someone, my advice is don't be afraid to ask someone out. Chances are they will be flattered either way. And let's be honest, would you ever be mad at someone asking you out!? Probably not. This applies to both girls and guys. Girls, it's ok to ask guys out, we live in 2015. And guys, almost any girl would be overjoyed to be asked out. So, long story short, put yourself out there because you never know until you try."
768,2015-08-24 20:39:42,Is it a problem if I've already slept with all the TAs (guys and girls) for one of my classes?
769,2015-08-10 09:40:43,Having a hot RA is kind of like having a hot cousin.
770,2015-08-09 11:17:45,PSA: nipple cover stickers are great bra alternatives in the summer.
771,2015-08-06 18:34:48,"One of my student groups fucked me over this year, so I'm milking the experience for an awesome grad school personal statement.  Thanks, assholes."
772,2015-08-05 23:23:49,Reading Wash U Confessions (especially #3027 ) really makes me hope that I never meet certain people on this campus..
773,2015-08-04 21:49:52,"When I was walking home a couple months ago, a girl in front of me started screaming at me for ""following her like a fucking creep"" and threatened to beat me up for ""acting rapey"".  As a gay guy, it really hurt to be generalized and demeaned this way.  I guess I have to start walking on eggshells to avoid this kind of confrontation in the future."
774,2015-08-04 21:39:53,I jump on campus activism bandwagons to be popular.  Last year I got so many likes on my profile pics holding signs that everyone agrees with!
775,2015-08-02 15:48:55,"I think the new webstac design is terrible. Why fix what isn't broken? Perhaps the goal was to make it easier to navigate on mobile, but why not just coordinate with the WUSTL app developer to make it more accessible that way? Why make the desktop site so hard to navigate? Ugh!

#3025 - part 2
Adding on to the confession about the new webstac site: they just got rid of the course listings! How am I supposed to see what courses are being offered?"
776,2015-08-01 02:55:56,"Growing up, my mom always told me that I didn't need to worry about the fact that I wasn't interested in clothes or make-up and that I wasn't physically attractive; I was a ""smart girl"" and God only gives us so much, so I shouldn't feel bad that I couldn't be both. I came to WashU, and that worldview was shattered. The girls here are physically attractive AND smart. I felt like an outsider. I now realize that I'm not the kind of girl that guys are interested in. The fact that I am a rising senior and have never been in a relationship or had a first kiss solidifies in my mind that it will never happen for me. I am scared that no guy will ever be interested in me. I'm not writing this for reassurance of any sort, considering you don't know me. I'm writing this because I need to say it, even if it's anonymous."
777,2015-07-27 21:41:57,There is a momma duck nesting in the courtyard of the DUC. Someone leaves out food and water for her. I want her to become the DUC duck.
778,2015-07-24 19:45:58,"When I was little, I was raped by an older cousin of mine several times a year. After seeing the recent confession about acid, I wanted to chime in that an experience with MDMA is what finally helped me break free of the bondage and control that the past trauma had over my life."
779,2015-07-23 05:35:11,I may not be tall or handsome but I am dark! Eh ladies?  That must count for something...?
780,2015-07-23 05:23:12,"I had been hooked on alcohol/heroin a couple of years ago, during high school, and I'm falling for this guy... he just confided in me that he was also using heroin at one point. I am so scared to keep seeing him, but I feel so drawn to him and I really care about him. Even though we've both been free from using for a while, I know that sharing it with someone is the way people fall down again. It's a huge 'what if' that I can't get out of my head"
781,2015-07-22 05:54:14,It really made me sad that none of my WashU friends posted anything about the Marines in Chattanooga.
782,2015-07-22 05:03:15,"I'm looking back at my old facebook posts and I'm just disgusted at myself for being an arrogant, insensitive shithead."
783,2015-07-22 05:54:20,I'm gonna search the Ashley Madison data dump for the hot women at my summer job.
784,2015-07-22 05:43:21,"To the female jogger running on the greenway path from Delmar to Campus, I apologize for almost crashing into you this morning on my skateboard. Your strong determination and obvious mental prowess through me off balance."
785,2015-07-18 08:14:22,League of Legends sucks.
786,2015-07-18 08:58:24,"I'm so stressed. For the past two years, my scholarships and financial aid have been enough for me to not have to pay a dime to come to WashU--which was the condition that my parents gave me for being allowed to go to college in the first place. This year, my dad got a raise, so my financial aid went down and now I have to pay a little. It's not a lot, only like $4000 a semester (this is after I begged them for more aid) but I can't ask my parents for money. I have enough money saved to pay for this semester, but I was hoping that my savings would be used to apply to medical schools next year. 

I have a feeling that everything will turn out ok eventually, but tonight I'm just so tired of being reminded that wanting to be a doctor is such an unrealistic goal for me. I'm in the process of studying for the MCAT, and somedays I can almost feel my white coat, while others, like today, make me lose all motivation."
787,2015-07-17 05:29:25,As an incoming freshman I would like to know if league of legends is big in the WashU community
788,2015-07-12 09:05:26,Protip:  Do acid at least once in your life.  You will learn so much about yourself and others.  Bonus points if you go to an Acton lecture while tripping.
789,2015-07-10 18:59:28,"I confess that I would detest receiving all the emails Wash. U. sends over the summer, were they not implicitly reminders that with each passing day, I am closer to finishing college.

I now realize much of my reasoning for coming to Wash. U. was misguided or even, in some cases, wrong.

A professor I liked who ultimately talked me into coming turned out to be a complete jerk. I was duped into believing Wash. U. was a friendly community: my female colleagues and I face seemingly relentless sexual harassment in math and science settings by both peers and professors. Worst of all, I'm not getting myself the education I thought I could, and I'm not sure it is possible to find it at Wash. U.

I almost wish I hadn't chosen to come here."
790,2015-07-10 06:38:29,"Scrolled all the way down to see what if confession #1738 would live up to the greatness of Fetty Wap.

Realized that you didn't even post confession #1738... you are SO not my trap queen, admin."
791,2015-07-09 22:56:32,"This is not really a confession but more of a question: has anyone ever dealt with Tamara King (Judicial Administrator)?

TLDR: the only thing this kid cares about is soon to disappear.

I have a great life. Or I used to. My family is falling apart.

My dad is pretty much a genius, but at the cost of social (and inevitably relational) skills. It's finally taken a toll on my mother after 20ish years. He tries his best, but they're are too many mental distractions/blockages that keep my father from the great husband/father he can be.

My mom keeps talking about splitting up. At first (a year ago), I thought it was her just worrying. It tore my heart in half to hear that. But my father has threatened to leave my mother and younger brother multiple times in the last month (and he is the main source of income). And when he is scared, my father digs himself (and our family) into debt to try to keep him and my mother together.

Both my parents had been married before, and the last time my father said that when his first life left him, he seriously considered suicide.

So basically, if my parents split, we have no money (we have very little as it is), my home life is broken, and the thing that scares me the most is that I fear my father might end his life.

The absolute worst part is that I know their relationship is not healthy and I can do nothing.

This is partially a confession and parially a plea for help. I missed the fall chem lab exam because I was horribly ill. Now I'm taking the exam over the summer, and just found out lecture videos won't be available. Is a chance anyone has the chem 151 lecture videos for fall 2014? Even if it's just one or two it'd be a tremendous help because I'm largely an auditory learner.

I just found out going through what I brough home that my notes etc from the course somehow ended up in one of the boxes to go in storage and is still in st louis! I'm really really desperate and now having the lecture videos would be even more helpful to successfully reviewing the material for the exam. If anyone can help me please comment!

Dude, please. This is the person who missed the chem 151 final because I was so sick. I need to do well on this exam.

825,2015-06-05 18:20:38,"Even as a girl I don't get all the uproar over the different expectations regarding men and women's sexual behavior. To me it's not a matter of ""double standards"", it's more like women HAVING standards. I feel like instead of trying to be more like men and make people accept promiscuity in women, us ladies should try to be CIVILIZING our fellow menfolk. Let's encourage them to commit! It may be unfair that people look down more on a woman who sleeps around, but on the flip-side, who looks at a man-whore and thinks ""wow, he seems like great boyfriend material""? We women should respect ourselves enough to hold ourselves to a higeher standard."
826,2015-06-05 18:51:40,"After returning home, a not so close family friend asked me ""Are you okay, after Ferguson and all of that stuff? Are you safe? I hope that none of that drama reached campus, it's just a shame. We just want to make sure you're okay!"" To which I replied, ""St. Louis is more than Ferguson."" Apparently the woman got truly offended by my comment and thought I was being rude and judgemental (don't quite get that one).

However, I find her response quite ironic, as that's exactly what I thought she was being when she asked such a naive question/comments. What happened in Ferguson is bigger than STL, and in many ways as those flyers around campus indicated, it reached our campus in many ways. What she said hints at a deeper ignorance and lack of awareness of what happened and still is happening in Ferguson, and around the country. I wanted to tell her off for the ignorance and insensitivity of what she asked me, but I held my tongue.

I don't know if I'm making sense, but what I'm trying to say is that the events in Ferguson effect everyone, in STL and elsewhere, and shouldn't be taken lightly  or regarded as foreign and tertiary issues to those outside of STL. STL is more than Ferguson, and Ferguson is about more than what happened last summer. It's about so much more, and this country and its people must work openly and passionately to encourage enlightened dialogue, compassion, understanding, and change."

I know that the Bible has been used to justify crimes of similar or higher calibre.  And it feels shameful to admit this, which is why i'm saying it on Wash U Confessions, but as a Jew I honestly feel a tiny bit scared when someone mentions they're a Muslim.  Maybe its just because of the media, just because most of the violence happening in today's world is centered around the Muslim faith.  And maybe that's just it.  The Inquisition was 500 years ago.  The Crusades happened longer before then.  But today the leader of the Catholic world seems to me to be somewhat of a reformist.  Maybe I haven't looked in the right places, but I don't see that type of leader in Islam and that continues to make me scared.  Especially when its a religion that refuses to allow others to poke fun at it because any religion that takes itself too seriously in the 21st Century has a problem.  I feel ashamed of these views but I can't stop having them and I can't stop treading lightly around those who proclaim the Muslim faith."

It just horrifies me that a guy might like *everything else* about me but then judge me based on my ""number"" because that's apparently *so* important. The number of mates I've been ""breed"" with is not going to reduce my ""quality"" because I am not some commercial good, some kind of cattle, yet when these kinds of measurements of sexuality are discussed, it results in our value as people being reduced to our perceived value as sex objects."

863,2015-05-25 00:24:52,"I can't speak for everyone, but my problem personally is with those people who try to excuse their condition but who actually haven't made much effort to rectify their situation. To me, this really de-legitimatizes those who actually do suffer from medical conditions that make it hard for them to lose weight/stay thin. Not everyone who is overweight suffers from medical conditions (I actually have a few relatives with hypothyroidism, so I'm aware that there are diseases that exist), and typically when I talk to people who are overweight, this tends to be the case... It really bothers me when people try to make excuses for their lifestyle rather than just admit the truth that their weight/body condition is the result of their lifestyle choices. For those people who have a legit condition though, I am supportive of, and for those same people who try to improve their lifestyle regardless of the difficulty, I have the utmost respect.

If I had to theorize why other people see overweight individuals in a negative light, it's for similar reasons. A few bad apples spoil the bunch, and in this case, I think they outnumber those individuals with factors that are beyond their control (based on what I've read in medial research). I do think people approach this issue poorly a lot of the time though"

865,2015-05-25 00:44:55,"I am genuinely curious: for those of you that feel upset by other people at WashU being overweight or physically unhealthy, is there any particular reason? I feel like as a community in general, we have a lot of thoughtful, healthy, and productive discussions about a lot of things, and I am so grateful for that, but on this issue in particular I see a lot of people being pretty condescending and I just don't understand what creates that divide in people's minds. 

I am someone who has struggled with my weight and with disordered eating, and I understand that it's a problem, but I know that my struggle is no one's problem but mine, and maybe my doctor's. I just don't get why someone else would want to make it their problem, too. I am lucky in that I have a lot healthier a relationship with myself now than I did at the end of high school, so people's criticism doesn't really bother me. 

But I do think that if you really want to help people who are unhealthy/overweight, pursuing a career in a health-related field, or maybe volunteering to play sports with kids or something would be a lot better outlet for your passionate feelings than rude anonymous comments."
866,2015-05-25 00:28:56,"To the extrovert with social anxiety from confession #2927:

I identify as a shy extrovert (because shy-outgoing and introvert-extrovert are two different spectrums!!), and I totally feel what you're saying.  I often have to give myself little pep talks before I enter new social situations to make myself go, but it almost always pays off because I end up enjoying myself and feeding off the social energy as a classic extrovert!  

My advice is to give yourself that pep talk and put yourself out there. Greet people you only kind of know, make plans with new people, talk to strangers, be friendly!  There are SO many friends I wouldn't have made if I hadn't made myself be the outgoing one even though I'm shy.  I know it's hard when what will make you happy also gives you severe anxiety - it might be easier if you felt one person to go out into new situations with, to give you a familiar anchor while you go meet new people.  But, I think overal you'll end up enjoying the fresh social energy and make new friends!  Good luck, and I wish I hadn't just graduated or else I could become your new friend too.  :)"

868,2015-05-24 22:58:58,I used my roommate's toothbrush for the last month of school because mine fell on the floor and I know he always used my shampoo. I'd say we're even now
869,2015-05-24 22:48:11,I can't stand STL summers. The humidity is fucking absurd.
870,2015-05-24 22:39:12,"Unfortunately, I cannot understand the positivity around herpes. Yes, accept yourself and don't dwell on it but don't embrace it either. And I hope people are sharing their STI/STD statuses with their partners to slow the outbreak."

872,2015-05-24 21:33:15,My biggest complaint about washU students is that they always have something to prove. That is all

874,2015-05-24 21:29:21,"I used to think I was an introvert but now I'm pretty sure I'm an extrovert with pretty bad social anxiety. Any advice? I'm in a couple of clubs but don't really have an ""inner circle"" that I can hang out with outside of student groups."
875,2015-05-24 21:44:22,"Every time I see a friend's post, confession, new ""soapbox"", or yak about them realizing they are and/or coming out as demisexual, I mentally become Mr. Burns and think ""Yes....join us...""

(I'm actually really happy that anyone feels brave enough to come out as anything seriously even if they don't actually come out)"
876,2015-05-24 20:17:24,"Watched an episode of My Little Pony yesterday... it was actually pretty cool, so I watched 98 more. Time for bed."
877,2015-05-24 20:03:25,I confess that I am apparently the only one who noticed that you jumped down from confession number 2892 to 2293 and then continued up from there.
878,2015-05-24 20:54:26,I miss WashU food so much. I could really use a Holmes wrap right now...

887,2015-05-24 19:35:41,"I'm still very disillusioned and disoriented after going through the interview process and being rejected from a certain honorary. It was an emotional roller coaster that I invested way too much in. A little respect goes a long way, but apparently some people are too lazy to be respectful."
888,2015-05-24 19:54:42,"I just graduated and i don't have many friends. I'm staying in STL for a year and want to find a friend group.

893,2015-05-24 19:46:52,I don't have a social life at school because I literally cannot find a student group that piques my interest and has an appealing community. I know freshman year isn't definitive of the whole college experience but I'm worried that nothing will change.
894,2015-05-24 19:39:53,Does anyone want to cuddle with me?  I have a vagina.
895,2015-05-24 19:31:55,"Anyone else wish their life were a documentary, reality show, or musical? Bc I sure as hell do."
896,2015-05-24 19:22:56,"To anyone disappointed by their financial aid award: call SFS and explain why it's not enough! Be specific with what economic hardships you're experiencing/where all your money's going. Trust me, they want to help you out."
897,2015-05-24 19:13:57,I have a terrible habit of comparing myself to others and always feeling subordinate to my friends and it's starting to negatively affect my life a lot.
898,2015-05-24 19:07:58,Boxers or briefs?
899,2015-05-24 19:29:11,I think half-and-halfs are overrated
900,2015-05-24 18:10:12,"As a senior, I kind of wish there was an animation appreciation club on campus. One in which you can discuss various topics relating to animation in film and on television, like why anime seems to be a little more sophisticated than Western animation. But also, I just kind of want to know how many people at WashU appreciate animation."
901,2015-05-24 18:43:14,"onfession submissions have been moved over to Wash U Soapbox. Topics include France, obesity, sensitivity, sexuality, and socioeconomics. 

Thanks again to the Soapbox admin - shawty, you the best :')"
902,2015-05-24 18:25:15,Just wanted to say that I also have herpes (oral).  Ain't no thang.
903,2015-05-24 15:04:20,"When I saw confession #2296, I wanted to comment so badly, but was also worried about the stigma. All I can say as someone who's had herpes for a year now is that the stigma is truly the worst of it. The first outbreak is awful, but after then you'll probably get them very infrequently if at all and they will be much less severe. I was devastated when I found out last year. I felt dirty and thought that I would never get to be intimate or to be in a relationship again (not true).

But honestly - this whole thing is ridiculous. The majority of people have the herpes virus but have it associated with their mouth. If you've ever gotten a coldsore, you could give someone that same virus down below when you give them oral. That's how I got it. It's illogical and unfair that there is such a stigma against literally a rash that is unlikely to come back frequently or strongly after its first expression and doesn't involve serious health problems. You  will be fine, your vagina/penis/whatever will be fine. You are still desirable and you are still a great person worthy of respect and dignity. Fuck people who judge or make fun. I'm still trying to overcome the stigma, but I don't feel dirty anymore, and HSV doesn't bother me anymore than the possibility of getting a cold (actually tbh after the first expression its much less shitty than a cold). 

What most helped me understand and come to terms with all of this were youtube videos by the TheSexUneducated. To anyone struggling with this now, or to anyone who's willing to listen and empathize, check them out. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YQzGV0xIFc."

906,2015-05-24 10:06:24,I was recently diagnosed with herpes. I cried when my doctor told me. I've only had one partner and we've been together exclusively for multiple years. I can't tell any of my friends from fear of either stigma or excessive sharing. I can't openly complain about how painful my genitals feel or how uncomfortable both sitting and standing often are or how terrible the pills I need to take taste or how I might have to deal with all this shittiness over and over again for the rest of my life. I thought I did everything right and now I'm an STD statistic. I have herpes.
907,2015-05-23 17:57:25,"I wish there were more fat people on campus, mainly because I'm tired of the fatphobic comments by members of my ""community"" and how authority figures let them slide.

Another reason: Everyone posts the cute clothes they want to get rid of in free and for sale but I can't get anything"

909,2015-05-23 09:09:28,"I was really nervous about being away from WashU because that's where I'm being treated for my mental health issues, but it's not that bad and I think I'm still improving. Can't wait to come back and show everyone I'm just a little bit stronger! :)"
910,2015-05-23 09:59:29,"To people who struggle with depression,

I know it's hard. I've suffered from depression myself. I've battled it since I was eight. In fact, my first attempt at suicide was in fifth grade.

It was really easy for me to give into depression. I had all the reasons to be. My life has been a story where almost everyone can hear and say ""wow, you've had it really rough.""

My father ran out on my mom and me when I was six. All I remember about him is how he used to beat up my mom. We'd always been poor but our livelihood got harder after he abandoned us. My mom soon became an alcoholic. She didn't really think about supporting me. It's not that she didn't love me. She was too broken to care.

When I was the angriest girl who thought life couldn't get any worse, my mom remarried a man who would sexually harass and abuse me till this day. When I was as self-conscious as an adolescent girl could be about her changing body, my stepfather would ask specific questions pertaining to my body. He once demanded that he see me naked. Needless to say, he would touch me in the most inappropriate areas.

Now I am back home for the summer and that despicable monster is still living with my mom. He tried to brush his hands against my inner thighs. I had to grab his hands and push them away because he wouldn't stop when I told him to. (I know I need to put an end to this but I am too traumatized and ashamed to reveal this without anonymity and seek help).

And yet, despite all these things, I've refused to slip back into depression for the past two -- I would say I overcame depression senior year of high school. And the most important realization that has help me overcome depression is this: It's not going to stop till you wise up. Your environment for which you blame your depression for won't change easily. It'll persist. And even when your current environment changes, there will be other obstacles that will sling you back into depression. You CANNOT let your environment deprive you of your right to be happy and enjoy life. Don't wait on the world to change. Make yourself stronger. I did it. So can you."
911,2015-05-22 19:21:32,I'm not sure how I'll adjust back to sitting in lecture halls after summer ends
912,2015-05-22 19:06:34,"heads up about a previous confession (#2802) - Wash U Confessions administration has not changed recently!

I know washuconfessions.com says there's a new admin, but that text has been up since September when I took over - I just never really bothered to update it. 

I also realize I said I planned on retiring last semester, but I feel like there's still some work to be done and I would like the page to be in a good place before I pass it off to the next admin.

Happy summer!"
913,2015-05-22 19:14:35,I think #2887 describes a lot of people and reading it freaked me out because I don't want anyone on my floor thinking I sent it!
914,2015-05-22 19:07:37,"Today as I was biking home from work, there was a man asking for cash on the corner of Forsyth and Skinker. He was walking alongside the curb, holding a cardboard sign, and peering into car windows. I don't carry cash with me, so I didn't think too much about it, but I also didn't swerve or anything to avoid him. I just stayed on my path, since I was on the sidewalk and in no danger of hitting him. However, as I biked around the corner, he suddenly yelled at me ""Don't worry! You're safe on your bike!"" and it startled me so much I lost control for a moment.

I'm still trying to figure out how to feel about this. Was this a joke? Was he making a bitter comment about his position versus mine? Was I supposed to laugh nervously at what he said? How was I supposed to react to a remark like that?

I simply pedaled away."
915,2015-05-22 17:17:38,"I graduated from Wash U but I already miss the city, school, and people. I regret not exploring St. Louis as much as I should have."
916,2015-05-22 17:57:40,"Even though we've already spent a summer apart and I know the three months will pass by before I know it, sometimes when I really miss my boyfriend i'll blow a kiss at the snapchats he sends me. I don't know why I'm embarrassed to admit this to him. Maybe I'll tell him on a random summer day to brighten up his morning!"
917,2015-05-22 17:44:41,"I just want to say that I've had a crush on this girl on my floor since the first week of classes. We grew very close the first semester, but then drifted apart when we came back second semester. All I want to say is if you know this is you, I care so much about you and want you to be the happiest you can be. I may not be able to give you what you want in a guy, but as long as I'm around you when you're happy (even if that means you're with someone else) that will be enough for me. Don't stop being who you are for anyone! You're amazing and will do amazing things!"
918,2015-05-22 17:48:42,I think I might be addicted to masturbation. I've been doing it fairly often (daily) and I'm not sure what to do (well besides going cold turkey)
919,2015-05-22 17:58:43,"Not to say grades don't matter, but just some encouragement for the people like me with C's.  Grades don't define you. Just because you didn't, or aren't, doing well here, doesn't mean its the end of the world.

920,2015-05-21 13:34:45,"Yo, message to all students who just finished their freshman year: freshman year is generally the worst. If your first year sucked, don't stress too much. When you get back to campus in the fall, try branching out in terms of classes you take, clubs you join, places you hang out or what you do in your spare time. I think a lot of people find that they make stronger and lasting friendships their sophomore year, not freshman year. Remember that college is what you make of it, and if you're not happy now, there are a ton of different things you could try or do to find what makes you happy."
921,2015-05-21 10:38:48,"Whenever I don't have a significant other in my life, I'm not nearly as happy as when I do.  It's not to say I'm depressed and can't get out of bed when I'm single, but I feel best when I have someone in my life.  There is something about having a consistent person to text, share news with, and have by your side that I find really comforting.  A lot of friends call me insecure because ""my happiness relies on someone else,"" but I'm quite confident in who I am...I just really like having a significant other in my life."
922,2015-05-21 10:12:49,"The night before graduation, I had a dream that I was in Jurassic Park. Both I and the dinosaurs could shrink down to the size of a bug, at will. So, hiding was out of the question. Basically, I wet the bed."

946,2015-05-20 22:13:40,The best thing about being in love with my best friend: I can tell the look on his face when he is lying/not lying and it feels great knowing that he means it when he tells me he loves me. Love is great

968,2015-05-20 21:22:26,"I'm so frustrated that so many guys at this school feel entitled to anything they want from girls. Even though they may take no for an answer, if a girl turns them down then they honestly believe something is wrong with her or she is just a bitch. I have felt this so many times, especially at fraternities (several in particular). These guys need to take a look in the mirror because girls probably have a very good reason for turning them down, especially that smug attitude. You are not entitled to anything from any girl, you have to go out there and show her that you are worth it and that she is worth it."

978,2015-05-17 14:38:42,"Hey Confessions Admin. My name is Johnny Heo - you may know me, you may not. The following is a message I put out to my friends - I'd love for you to share it with the rest of WashU as well, if it so happens that you share the same ideals as I do. I hope to abandon the selfish life I've been living till now, and hope to use what I believe to be my talents, for the betterment of all people. I dabble here and there in producing and creating hip-hop. I'm nowhere near what you'd call ""good"";  I've made some waves in the past for performing/releasing my original work. However, the subject matter of all my songs were always about the same things you're apt to hear in most of hip-hop; girls, drugs, partying, money, etc.. I'm not okay with that anymore. Hopefully, the following blurb would better help you understand my dream.
---

I know you're unhappy - if not as a whole, then about something specific. I want you to tell me why. I want you to tell me what I can do to help. By comment, by private message, by text (248-885-6571).. In any way. Let me share in your struggles. No one deserves to fight the good fight alone. If not you, then someone you know. Pass it on.
Afterwards, if you so desire, I'd like to write a song about you. I'd like to show the world that you're more than your Facebook statuses, Instagram photos, college admissions essays, grades, occupations, etc. You're more than that to me - you're a human being, just like me.
This is all I can do for the world to make it a better place. It's not much, but it's all I can do.
I'll write the songs of your sorrow, so we can accomplish a better tomorrow.

Thank you,
Your friend & advocate,
Johnny"

Think of a person who has meant something to you. A close friend. Sibling. Mentor. Honestly the first person who pops into your head who's done something worth a damn to you.

Let them know what they mean to you and what you think of them. Clearly and explicitly, in a letter or over the phone or email or even a cleverly chosen series of Snapchats.

Because one of my close friends here just did that, and I am sitting here still thinking about it and bawling my eyes out. I don't think of myself as an emotional guy. But that kindness meant so much more to me than I thought it would. And that person that you just thought of, who means something to you? That person deserves that feeling too.

I never even tried to hookup with random women out of a crippling fear that we'd get to third base and she would look at my penis and decide it was too small. Eventually, I found a girlfriend, but even then I made her wait to have sex under the premise of me not being ready yet, but in reality it was because I didn't want her to see my penis. She always tells me that she thinks its a good size, but I just can't believe her. Its gotten to the point where it is constantly on my mind, and it always gets me down, and I can't take it anymore.

My lowest GPA semester also had the least credit hours. My highest GPA semesters had the most credit hours. My excitement about the classes I was taking corresponded really well with my performance, go figure.

take whatever the heck classes YOU want to take, don't listen to advisors if you don't believe them. you know yourself better and your peers know the classes better, advisors only gonna lead you astray. If you want to take a class do it, if you really want it you'll pull it off.

And required classes suck sometimes, but if you have something fun in your schedule at least it will bring you joy.

1009,2015-05-09 03:44:43,"I’m having somewhat of a mid-undergrad crisis.  Ever since I was little and saw the health problems my parents faced I’ve imagined being a doctor.  I came to WashU fully intending to study Chemistry on a pre-med track (and, as a rising junior, that is still the plan).  However, recently I’ve found myself pulled in another direction entirely.  I started sophomore year by joining an a cappella group as well as taking some courses for a Music minor; I have a lot of experience with the piano so the music wasn’t anything new, but the acting and singing of a cappella and some WashU singing courses gave me a new appreciation for the art of music.  My voice teacher has encouraged me to pursue this kind of thing further, and I’ve realized that nothing would make me happier.  I can’t help but feel guilty, though, when I think about the selfless intentions that made me set out on the pre-med track; my problem is that I don’t know how to finish out my time at WashU in a way that satisfies all these selfless goals while making me truly happy."

Now that the weather is pleasant, he spends a lot of time outside the building and he seems to be there every day at  5:30 as people are returning from work. I am sure he does this because he wants the social contact, and I am sure he appreciates getting to talk to people because he always finds a way to start a conversation.

But every day when I round the corner and see him sitting there, I feel a twinge of frustration. I have run out of small talk to make and I get anxiety about finding a polite way to end the conversation and get inside. And I hate myself for it, because I know the conversations we have make his day a little brighter.

1032,2015-05-04 21:06:34,"(Admin, please, please post this.)
I was surfing the website before I bumped into an article by this blogger called SciBabe (side note: she's awesome.). It talks about pro-ana websites so I clicked onto the link.

I was terrified.

I was EDNOS for a while and bulimic for a while...without a formal diagnose though. There was one month in which I ate ~300 calories and then purged, exercises 3 hours compulsively, and weighed myself a dozen times a day. I was at my lowest weight in the last decade by the end of the month. But I was miserable...the damage done to my self-esteem has still not been repaired after 3 full years. I still use food as reward and punishment, still binge when I feel rejected, have suicidal thoughts now and then.

And most importantly...the amount of weight I lost in that miserable month was exactly the same as I did in the past 3 weeks (I regained a lot of the weight back in the last 3 years). For the last 3 weeks, I exercised every day for around an hour, and ate a hot dinner afterwards. I did count calories but I've never went below the recommended guideline from scientific resources. I did not avoid food - including fried chicken tenders sometimes, just ate everything in moderation. And now I felt a lot more in my own body, beated my PR by a lot, and hadn't had suicidal thoughts for a good while.

I am willing to admit that I still care about my shape, and to a lot lesser extent, weight. I do want to look good, impress people, gain confidence. But even if you've decided to try pro-Ana tips because of the exact same reason (as what a lot of the comments on the website state)...please, please do not do that. I believe you've heard enough about the health consequences. But even if you say you don't care about that...an eating disorder is not going to take you to wherever you want. You want to be thin/look good for some reason right. ED does not help with any of these. People are just wired to be a lot happier exercising and eating than not exercising and starving. And your BMR slowed down so much when you go below 1000 calories a day. Not worth it. Really.
For the people who said ""blame the media for imposing this on us, who the hell want an ED if that's not what your standards of beauty""...a) ED is hugely genetic. Pushing all the responsibility onto media does not do justice for people who had ED. And besides that...if you think that's unrealistic, why do you keep doing that? Check out the photos of athletes. Human beings naturally have appreciation for certain body types for evolutionary reasons - but definitely, absolutely not the deathly thin type. Beauty is associated with power.

I'm heartbroken when I read through those comments...i think every recovered ED patient would want to rest of the world to know that it's a way to never fall into. If there are anyone who read this who are on those websites...please stop. That's my heartfelt plea.

Sorry for the long rant."

The thing is, I was suicidal for a long time. I never actually made the attempt, but I came what I consider worryingly close. The reason I make these jokes is really as a kind of mental catharsis. I'm no longer in the place where I genuinely feel afraid of this, and joking about it is a kind of quiet mental victory. Like I CAN joke about this, because it isn't the big scary dragon in my mind anymore, just a pathetic little worm that doesn't control me anymore, The thing is, a lot of my friends don't know about this, so I feel like they may be genuinely worried about the amount of suicide jokes I've been making.

On every campus tour I went on, all across the country, they always vaguely say they have lots of clubs, so many clubs they even have a juggling club. WashU not only has a juggling club, they have a juggling  club affiliated with some of the best youth jugglers in the country via City Museum's Circus Harmony! WashU doesn't stop there, we have clubs for butter churning, bee keeping, medieval combat, and  if thats not your thing there's always the mariachi band. Maybe we have less sports pride than state schools, but anyone interested can check out clubs for fencing or archery.

But maybe you need to leave the campus scene, what could you possibly do in the greater St. Louis area? With the free public transportation, bus and metro, you get for being a student, its pretty easy to get around. But if thats not enough, just rent a car from campus. Or you know, get a bike real cheap from other students selling in desperation on Free and For Sale. And with your vehicle of choice you can pop over to the Zoo, or the Science Center, because STL is one of the very few places in the world where those have free admission. Try the history museum and brush up on what the 1904 world's fair was all about, it comes up all the time anyways. If the gigantic St. Louis Art Museum is too overwhelming you can always visit the Pulitzer, or CAM. Not into museums? Try touring Schlafly or Anheuser Busch breweries. If you want the free alcohol goat petting combo, make the slightly longer trek out to Grant's Farm. And these are all just the free things!!! DO YOU SEE HOW MANY FREE THINGS THERE ARE??? Of course you can also go to the Botanical Gardens or City Museum which are well worth the price of admission. Or go see the STL Symphony in Powell hall with discounted student ticket prices.

You can do internships for class credit or money from the career center if its unpaid.

You can get involved in research with your dream professor with your raw enthusiasm.

You can make a difference in the community by volunteering your time and effort.

This school is a land of opportunity. There is plenty of room for criticism, but I think we're all aware of that. Just know there is great wonder in this land."
1047,2015-05-04 12:43:57,I just spent 2 hours looking up all eligible princes instead of studying for a class final because suddenly becoming Kate Middleton 2.0/a Disney princess became so much more real than doing well in that class.
1048,2015-05-04 12:46:58,"So I was thinking about it and I was trying to come up with an example of what finals week is like for Wash U students, partly because I wanted to shed more light for the prefrosh and partly because I need to explain it to my little brother. Here's the deal about Wash U work hard play hard is a pretty apt description of the schools environment. The work is strenuous and its hard to catch up so stay ahead but there's always something going on and the people really are incredible. I think finals week is best described as the movie Crank. If you havent seen it give it a go, super short, not great but fun. Imagine yourself as Chev Chelios and one day you wake up with a startling realization, in the movie he was poisoned and at Wash u it's more of a ""Woah, finals are in 4 days"". The only reason its ""Woah"" is that there is a mini break ""reading week"", a time period no one really uses for anything but not studying. Then you hear that if you stop moving you die, or in this case if you stop studying you are fucked. Then you grab whatever suppliments you can to keep you going, red bulls, coffee, nos, fried foods, every damn pset you never wanted to see again, and you dont really sleep. Maybe you planned well and you get some kind of  sleep but caffeine doesnt really let you get rest. You dont stop until they are all done and if you do you are screwed. Dont let yourself get stuck on one problem dont let yourself play one game of league, just go. You have time afterwards. They made a sequel after all."

1054,2015-05-04 11:09:21,"Tonight (Sunday) I was walking in front of Brookings (it must have been around 9PM) and I saw a guy and a girl walking somewhere together. They were walking on that road that passes in front of Brookings, the one with no sidewalks, to get to Forsyth it looked like. Anyway, a car was driving up behind them, and it clearly saw them and wasn't going to hit them or anything, but the guy immediately held her shoulder and switched places with her so that he was standing on the inside of the road instead.

Although neither of them probably would have been harmed, he just instinctively did that and you could tell how much he cared for her. It just really made me smile and I thought I'd share. Idk, I love when guys do things like that -- it's the little things."

1057,2015-05-04 11:36:25,"Dear Admin,

I'm not sure why people think you're so great for reading a few sentences and clicking a couple times and posting things. You have finals true, but when you post outside of finals and people think you're doing such a great thing I just don't understand. Your job isn't that difficult and I'm pretty sure you're writing a vast majority of the posts that praise you. Hopefully you graduate soon and let someone more humble take your spot.

Sincerely,

Me

==============================================

Wow you are salty. 

If you really think I write confessions about myself, you're welcome to talk to me in-person and look at the submissions logs from washuconfessions.com. I can't tell who a confession comes from but there are ways to know if they come from the same person. There just really isn't a way for all those confessions to have come from me. 

But it seems like you've pretty much already made up your mind. And considering you had to use my own website to anonymously send hate mail, I'm thinking you're too much of a coward to actually meet me face-to-face. 

You're right though, copying and pasting isn't hard. That's the part of the job that people see.  I don't really talk much about the other parts.

Reading suicide letters and knowing it's not a good idea to post them is hard. Reading posts every day from people who have been cheated on/want to cheat  is hard.  Dealing with student groups who want to censor certain confessions is hard. Putting up with people like you who abuse anonymity to spread hatred is hard. 

Regardless, I'm likely going to be stepping down next semester. But it's for my own good, not because you want me to. I'm sorry to be going to a school with a coward like you.

Admin"

I also would 100% commit to WUSTL if I could do it all over again. I call out the problems *because* I love and care about this university and want to see it do better, because I believe it can. It's not perfect. Just like people criticize America without hating the country and wishing they'd been born somewhere else.

I really don't want to give up this adventure I've been living. Honestly, I don't think I will give it up. I have my own cute little place off campus that I'm not ready to leave. It's in the middle of St. Louis, and my home and my job makes me feel so connected to this city-- to the nice, clean, wealthy places and to the people who are completely preoccupied merely with survival. Honestly, the part of it that gets me the most is the number of damn interesting conversations I never would have had if I hadn't become a escort. Maybe I am emotionally polyamorous and I can't settle down. I just wish I hadn't decided to be with someone who makes me feel like what I am, what I feel that I truly am, is a phase.

Everyone was a little nerdy, a little awkward, but incredibly friendly, hardworking, and supportive.

But my parents are helping me pay for a very, very expensive education and I feel the constant pressure to be exemplary. I'm never good enough for myself because I feel like I have to achieve something that i wouldn't have been able to achieve going to my in-state school. When I was younger, I used to tell my parents I'd help pay for my little sister's college because by then I'd have graduated college and hopefully have a paying job. But now I'm looking at getting higher forms of education ( med school) which was never part of my plan before. Now I feel  greedy and I wish I went to a state-school to save my parent's money.

1194,2015-04-29 10:23:53,"As I near the end of my freshman year, I'm considering transferring elsewhere. I have a lot of reasons, but I keep telling myself that I belong here even though I often feel alone (not an uncommon feeling for many students, as I understand).

My boyfriend goes to school in a different state, and we've been together 3 years. We thought it wouldn't be so bad, since we've been apart before, but he's my best friend, and I have so few good friends here. I know that if I were to transfer, I would have a solid friend base--I've met and talk regularly with a bunch of his friends at his school, and they have activities I would participate in that WashU can't offer me. My boyfriend succeeds there academically whereas I often have trouble keeping my head above water, and I attribute that partly to my unhappiness with my friends. I miss out on so many events and stuff that I would otherwise go to due to the fact that I have trouble finding people I click with.

But I also don't want to uproot what I do have here. It's a lot of work to transfer and reestablish everything I've built here at a new place, and it's not like WashU is miserable or anything. I have a few friends with whom I'm close and who are dear to me, some professors I have come to know and value, and a lot of other perks about WashU that I enjoy (the little stuff, you know). I also worry about what my parents would think--they've never particularly supported my relationship (but they haven't dissented either), and they've always stressed the importance of academics above significant others. They're paying for my entire education. I know they want me to be happy, but I worry that they'll think I'm trying to transfer for something as ""superficial"" as being with him, when it's really a lot more than that. It's academics, a social life of my own, extracurriculars, and general well-being. Not to mention that he is my closest and most important friend in my life. I'm just afraid that if I stay here, my unhappiness is just going to grow into a monster. I never seriously entertained the idea of transferring until tonight.

I don't want to admit to myself that I made a mistake in coming to WashU, and I don't want it to be a mistake--this is such a nice school, my major is wonderful, and there really aren't problems with WashU. I want to stay. But I also want to be happy, and I haven't felt happy for almost an entire semester."

Ever since then I've been sad because that describes me perfectly. I have a really hard time being social and reaching out to people, and it really hurts to hear that kind of talk.

1200,2015-04-27 20:38:12,"Graduating senior being overly reflective here:

I think my mental health has been poor since second semester sophomore year. I've been struggling to do my work, care about extracurriculars and maintain my composure in stressful situations. I've snapped more often at people I care about. It was such a slow transition (with enough ups and downs to hide the trend) that it's been hard to tell if I'm actually sadder overall or it's another down to ride out until an up. But I'm pretty sure that yeah, my mental health took a longterm nosedive.

My grades are solid overall, and despite some regrets I've acceptable extracurricular involvement and good friends. What it boils down to I think is being sad about my family. My home life has gotten progressively shittier every semester, and I'm starting to think it's the source of most of my personality changes. I've been thinking things like ""Why should I tolerate this crap when I already got to deal with all of this XYZ with my family"" and yelling more. I've been thinking that no matter how much good I do here I'm not at home trying to fix things and it's tanked my self worth.

So to everyone who has stress at home of whatever sort, whether better or worse than me: I'm sorry you have to deal with it. I'm sorry you have to balance it with all the stress and academic rigor and busy-ness of WashU. I'm sorry that people you care about are hurting. But you're not alone, (woo, everybody's sad) and you'll have to try your best to keep going. That's what your family wants for you, hopefully.

That, and a well paying job to help support them and their bad financial decisions and emotional damages. Or is that just me?"

1213,2015-04-25 10:37:35,"Trigger Warning: sexual assault/rape
Some of my friends will probably know this is me when they read this, but that’s ok because I feel like what I have to say is important and needs to be seen by those who are maybe going through something similar.

Tonight was “Take Back the Night” and I didn’t attend. I fully support the event and I think it is incredibly empowering and uplifting and I hope to attend next year. I didn’t attend because not too long ago I was the victim of rape. I’ve been debating whether or not to go to TBTN for about a week now and earlier tonight when someone asked me why I wasn’t going, the first thought that popped into my head was “it’s too soon. I can’t go. I can’t talk about rape right now.”

And that was actually the first time I admitted to myself that what had happened to me WAS rape. Since it’s happened I’ve been labeling and relabeling it. A “mistake” or “my fault” or “if only I hadn’t had so much to drink” or “well, it was something I had thought might happen earlier in the night”. I have spent my college career educating myself on sexual assault and had considered myself well versed and armed against these feelings that have now been in my mind and in my body since it happened.

I blacked out and had sex with someone I barely knew and they were sober. I woke up the next day alone, trying to piece together the events of the night before and realized that the little I knew caused my crippling anxiety and horror. But I immediately started trying to explain it away and I internalized the blame. I joked about what had happened with some friends, hoping that would ease the tension I was feeling. But as the days passed and my anxiety didn’t abate I was forced to come to terms with the fact that something wrong had happened to me. The hardest part about this whole thing has been learning to forgive myself. I’m trying to piece together how to get over it, how to not resent myself forever. I did not ask for, or deserve, what happened to me. I was raped. Earlier today when I admitted it to myself it gave me chills and I broke down and I want to curl into a ball and stay in bed but that’s not an option. I feel like admitting that this is what happened is the first step on the road to being ok again. Or, at least I hope it is.

Anyway, even if this doesn’t get published I needed to write it down somewhere. I need to know I’m not crazy; I need to know that I didn’t do this to myself. Someone else did this to me. It is not my fault.

It is not my fault."

1223,2015-04-23 03:26:52,I miss when WashU Confessions was a healthy 50/50-ish split of funny and serious. I understand the benefit of getting an issue off one's chest. I just wish it didn't have to cost what used to be a genuinely great source of stress relief.

I think about it every day and wonder how I let it get this far that I haven't been to church since January. It's paralyzing to think about all the changes I'd have to make in order to be in good standing again. But then I think about all the things I'd have to give up and it doesn't seem worth it. Since I went inactive, I've been able to spend the night in my boyfriend's arms, take my first shot with my friends, and not constantly worry about how much skin my clothes are revealing. It's freeing to be out from under the thumb of my church. As much as it hurts to say it, I don't think I'll ever be active again because I love my life so much better without my church."

The media portrays us as freaks and even groups promoting mental health awareness rarely mention it. The only person I've ever told is my dad. I'm too afraid to tell my friends even though I really wish I had some more support. This is the hardest thing I've ever had to go through. I don't want to do it, I don't know why I do it, and I can't fucking stop. I miss classes, waste hours, and cause myself a ridiculous amount of pain, depression, and anxiety because of this awful disease. I've been in and out of different treatment programs for a year and nothing seems to work. I feel so frustrated and alone."
1229,2015-04-21 18:00:11,"It seems like the vast majority of students here come from very supportive, loving homes. But not all of us do. I’m sure there are many others who come from abusive or dysfunctional families. So please don’t jump to conclusions if we want to stay on campus over break or if we aren’t exactly thrilled to be going home for the summer.

I get it. You’re excited to be with people you love and care about. But for many of us, WashU represents the freedom to be a person that for whatever reason we could never be at home.

So please don’t accuse us of not loving our parents enough, or try and teach us the “value” of family, or even badger us with questions about why on earth we wouldn’t want to go home for a week.

You don’t know what our home lives are like. Just respect our decision and try to understand."

1235,2015-04-20 18:03:22,"I know this is a long confession but stick with me because it has 420 relevance.

When I was in HS, there was a bully.  He was specifically fond of my friend and I.  By fond I mean cruel.  So one day, after a particular round of cyber-bullying, my friend asked me to send photo's of his posts as evidence.

But because we were using his name so much, it was at the front of my mind and I mistakenly sent the pictures to the bully.

By complete luck, I got into the bully's email and corrected the mistake without him ever knowing I had emailed him at all.

But now every time I am gossiping about someone online, I get paranoid because I fear using their name so much, will cause me to message them by mistake.

I confess all of this because on this 420 day, my boss is out.  They chose last second to not come to work.  I thought about messaging a friend voicing my suspicions and then thought of accidentally sending that message to my boss.

It gave me such chills, the image of sending ""I bet my boss is high as fuq right now"" to my boss, that I felt compelled to confess."

I don't tend to carry change nor do I have the money to give him change a couple of times a day so I generally offer an apologetic no. A few weeks ago, I bought him a full meal, but he does not seem to remember me. Today I was in the middle of a serious phone conversation when he asked me for money so I didn't answer him. He started rudely calling out after me like I was this horrible person for ignoring him the hundredth time he had disturbed me. It bugs me that I have to deal with this every day. Homelessness sucks. I just happened to have been born into a middle class family while he lives on the streets. He may have done this to himself or he may have just had some really bad luck. He may use the money for drugs or he may use it to buy food. Who am I to judge him. I would probably be rude to people too if I had to live like that. But at the same time, dealing with him everyday is annoying and upsetting. I am really torn on this whole situation and I wish there was something I could do to help end homelessness for good."

1244,2015-04-17 13:49:37,"The pencils in the grass during mental health awareness thing hit me just a little harder now. Someone I knew from back home posted a suicide note as his facebook status and killed himself.

He wasn't a friend. We just never were really close. The main thing I remember is how much he was bullied. I'm sure there were times I participated, even if I don't remember specifically. I know that I can't change it, but what if I hadn't, what if I had been better?

I see kids interact pretty regularly, and it's getting harder and harder. I see them playing out what I experienced. I can't stop them from hurting one another, and they haven't had enough time to learn just how much words hurt.

All of this just makes my heart hurt. I wish I could help more than I do, I wish I could change what I did and who I was. But I also just wish that this bright, enthusiastic kid I knew wouldn't become a part of the worst statistic for me to hear."

1247,2015-04-16 17:36:41,"So many people complain about the hook-up culture that you'd think it didn't exist. I'm tired of hearing how hard it is to ""find a guy who wants a relationship and not hook-ups"". There's an implied judgement, particularly on guys, that hooking up is negative and douchey thing to do (girls, unfortunately, get stuck with the slut label from those who are sex-negative). I'm a guy who has enjoyed a few very committed and long lasting relationships, and they were great, but I prefer to hook-up in between those. I separate sex from emotions very easily, and while the sex is more enjoyable when I care about the person, I don't see why it makes me a bad person just because I fulfill my sexual needs without. Complaints about ""hook-up culture"" imply that people who participate are shallow tools, when really I just know what I need now and that any relationship that comes to me will not come the same route that my hook-ups do."

1256,2015-04-15 16:30:56,"Why, why is it so hard to find a guy who wants a relationship rather than hook-up??? As someone whose sexual pleasure intertwines with emotional tie, I'm not only sexually but also emotionally frustrated. After I broke up with my last guy, I started making out with people I meet at parties or Tinder, but it just feels not great. It feels empty, meaningless, boring and even a bit disgusting. For me, if there is no emotion tie, it's hard to be sexually awaken, not to mention experiencing pleasure. I wish our culture could encourage both relationship and hook-up, so that people will have more choices and don't need to pretend promiscuous if they want something meaningful."
1257,2015-04-15 16:17:57,"My partner and I are breaking up.  Graduation opened our eyes about what would really happen if we tried to stay together.  Words cannot express the pain I feel thinking about losing my best friend.  I have never been so underwhelmed about my future or life.  Moving on to the next stage of my life without them feels more like dying and being born as someone else than a happy mark of progress.  And I know I have to let them go because they desire too much I cannot give them.  Finishing school this year seems impossible, and I'm sincerely worried I will fail my classes.  Emptiness consumes me.  And I don't really care what happens next."

1264,2015-04-13 18:43:21,"sh U!

Someone has created a Wash U Soapbox page for sharing perspectives on social issues. It is being run separately from Confessions, and it should be a great place for sharing anonymous political views to an audience that is open to that sort of discussion. Having a page dedicated solely to political perspectives could be a great resource for the community and a breath of fresh air for the Confessions page. 

After having talked with the Soapbox admin over the past few days, I think he'll be a great fit for running the page. Some of the more politically-charged submissions sent to Confessions may be sent over to Soapbox, where they'll be served to a more willing and accepting audience. 

I recommend checking out the Soapbox page if you're interested in finding a community where political views can be shared safely. Giving Soapbox my support and wishing them the best of luck!

1268,2015-04-13 01:00:26,"My amazing boyfriend just broke up with me tonight because we've both been depressed for the past few months. His plan of action is to withdraw from everyone and obsess over one hobby; thus, he barely has involved himself in our relationship. I know that we should break up, because he wants or needs to be alone and not worry about a girlfriend (especially a girl who is especially needy because of her depression), but it hurts so badly. He is the most beautiful human being I've ever met. Even while he's in so much pain, he has made me promise that if I want to, I'll call him when I'm having a panic attack. I hope tomorrow morning he'll call and finally tell me what he's going through, and how he really feels, as he has yet to. I think he's afraid of being vulnerable. But I would rather be with him even while he's half-assing it because he's struggling to take care of himself than with someone else gives it his or her all. No one compares to you and what you've done for me. I love you, dude."
1269,2015-04-12 23:27:28,"I recently read a Facebook post of a friend of a friend on my newsfeed talking about the Israeli-Palestinean conflict and how different student groups on our campus hold different opinions.

I just wanted to say that just because some of us on campus are Persian or Iranian doesn't mean we side with Palestine. If you learn the history of Iran (which WashU should offer a course on) you'd know that many of us left the country in the 1980s because of the radical Republic. I just think it's a little biased for people to either a) assume that all Iranians side with Palestine because we might be Muslim and b) assume that Iranians would oppose legislation on sanctions on Iran.

Just like any other race, we are all individuals with different experiences. Please don't group us all together because we share the same race.

Thanks :)"

1272,2015-04-12 16:26:34,"It's interesting to compare the content of WashU Confessions with the Confessions of state schools. The student confessions here feature very deep personal struggles with depression and drinking; or an intellectual debate on current events or political issues. Whereas at other schools I've seen... well simple stuff... like vulgar stuff about their sex lives and petty drama. I don't know, I think it says something but I'm not sure what."
1273,2015-04-12 14:38:35,I tried to commit suicide at the end of January (right after starting back up at Wash U after a 1.5 year medical leave). My mother won't even try to understand and is so angry about it that she has financially cut me off. I've lost 20 lbs because I can't afford to eat.
1274,2015-04-12 13:20:37,"I think I should stop drinking. I know I'll have fun at parties either way, but something is ingrained me to think I have to be hammered to have fun. After parties, when I often go home alone (not that that's a bad thing), I end up becoming really sad, almost depressed. I know that it's the alcohol because I wake up and move on with my life. So, I respect everyone who doesn't need to have a drink to enjoy other people."
1275,2015-04-12 00:49:38,"I feel like the fact I don't drink has negatively affected my love life. It seems like all the guys at WashU I've met think that if I'm not rallying right along with them, then I'm not worth their time. Guess what: I can still have a great time when I'm sober. I like to dance like nobody's watching. I like to laugh at all the funny things drunk kids do. I can be fun too. It's not awkward unless you make it awkward. I'll be the exact same fun, smart, beautiful girl tomorrow... isn't that enough? I wish there were someone out there who could respect that, because right now I just feel like an absolute reject."
1276,2015-04-11 23:58:40,"I wish I had chosen Northwestern instead of WashU. It's been a miserable 4 years and I have no friends who go here... but I have a degree and a spot in a great law school, so I guess all's well that ends well?"

1283,2015-04-11 13:48:52,"When is enough, well, just that, enough? At what point is something no longer worth it despite all of the time, effort, and emotional investment you've put into it.

I have never given into a serious relationship before, I've always been guarded  and in some ways rightfully so. Many people are able to wear their hearts on their sleeves as the saying goes, but given the things I've seen and personally been through, it no longer comes easily to me, it's unnatural. The following may sound elementary to you all, but like I said, I've never been in a serious relationship before and am completely out of my element.

I started seriously dating someone who has been a close friend of mine for the past 3 years now and given into the emotional intimacy of it all. I've fought off this very moment in all of my relationships as I don't think I could take on the downfall of it on top of everything else in my life. Recently though, I've found that I'm questioning this decision. I've seen the conversations between him and this person he calls ""only a friend"" ""who's like an older sister to [him]."" Funny thing is, our friendship started in a similar way, in that I was in a year above his and just called us friends.

I've seen how she can be inappropriately flirtatious with him, to my face no less. She's made comments about me that I wouldn't think of making about a friend's significant other. I'd like to believe I'm a decently perceptive person, and when I feel like there's something suspicious going on, there most likely is something to be suspicious of. To make matters worse, he asks her about attending events that he hasn't even brought up to me.

If it was anyone else, I would've brought this issue up and ended the relationship the moment I found out about these things, these are things I don't tolerate. But with him, it's different because he was the first friend I became close with in a place I felt so isolated and alone in, he stuck it out with me and made being here bearable. But at what point is enough enough? I don't want this relationship to ruin my outlook on any future, prospective, meaningful relationships I may have if it isn't worth it from the start."
1284,2015-04-11 11:56:53,"So, this is in reference to a confession that was posted this morning then subsequently deleted that argued that the current admin should post material that is more political, controversial, and offensive in nature because it really shows Wash U students for who they are.

Now, I gotta hand it to the admin that there is good reason to not make these posts. A lot of them just devolve into mud-slinging and a bunch of people jumping down someone's throat because the anon expressed an opinion that is pretty unpopular. These posts do go on to divide the community in a lot of ways

Also, though this isn't really about those posts, I think that the admin has a good handle on posts regarding mental health and the like. Those are very touchy, especially for people like me who have dealt with those issues. While we want for people to be able to talk about those things, an anonymous page isn't really a great place to do that...

But back to the point. I think the admin has some great reasons for his course of action, I really do. But I think also that the anon post from earlier touched on something important (though s/he admittedly didn't say this explicitly). There needs to be a place where people can express unpopular political opinions without fear of backlash toward themselves. Of course, I've heard all the arguments of ""Well they only need to express them anonymously because they're too cowardly to express them otherwise.""

Perhaps this is true, but judging from many of the responses I've seen on Confessions and YikYak and other anonymous sources, I'd say people have good reason to hesitate before voicing an opinion that goes against the mainstream here--they get attacked for it. In a way, anonymous social media is a necessity for a lot of people to speak up without fear of becoming ostracized, and refusing to post these on the basis that they result in a bunch of fighting essentially amounts toward censorship of a targeted group. True, the opposite side gets censored as well, but considering it quashes any real attempts at conversation from opposing views in the non-anon world, this doesn't really affect them all that much.

Also, and this is entirely just my opinion, I don't think these posts are necessarily causing divisions--rather, they're just exposing divisions that already exist. It's easy to act like the whole campus is unified when we act as though everyone's already of the same opinion. As soon as someone voices a differing opinion, though, all the faults lines are revealed, not created. But if anyone has any real intention of overcoming these divisions, then should we not know from where they come?

If I had to suggest a solution, I'd say make separate page for it. But that's just me. I'm sure someone can find some purported argumentative flaw in my logic, but that's my two cents"

My parents seriously believe that being gay is a choice. I'll admit, I make some pretty bad decisions, mostly food related, but I'd sooner eat a bad batch of guacamole and have the shits for 16 consecutive days than choose to be in a lifelong battle with myself over how some dumb girl makes my heart beat faster than Chris Hemsworth does.

Honestly if I could choose, I'd choose to be straight. But for the first time ever I confess that I'm not, and it sucks. But it'll probably get better. But it sucks right now so I kind of just want to curl up in a ball and eat a block of cheese or something."
1289,2015-04-10 15:11:11,"y have noticed that the overall tone of Confessions has been changing over the past few months. 

When I started running this page, I tried to make it a place where people could be honest, funny, dark, quirky, etc. I wanted this page to give everyone a voice, but somewhere along the line Confessions got caught up in arguments and politics. 

If I don't post a confession arguing about some political issue, it's because Wash U Confessions isn't the right place for that. Each of these confessions hits about 3,000 news feeds and it would be irresponsible to anonymously promote a political agenda to such a large audience. Anonymous arguments only serve to divide the community and start hatred. I'm also tired of special interests groups trying to intimidate me into spreading their political agenda. It simply isn't going to happen anymore. 

More importantly, if you send in a confession about wanting to kill yourself and I don't post it, it isn't done out of malice - I can't emphasize that enough. Suicidal confessions trigger other people into sending similar confessions about suicide, and the problem snowballs out of control. Honestly, reading suicidal confessions and deciding it's best not to post them is a decision that I literally lose sleep over. 

I can't say that every decision I've made on accepting or rejecting a post was perfect. But after having gone through thousands of confessions I've started to get a feel of how a confession can affect the school, and this page shouldn't be negatively impacting the community. It simply isn't in the spirit of Confessions. 

If you have any feedback as to how Wash U Confessions has been lately, feel free to directly inbox this page on Facebook. I do remember people who have messaged me and what they say, and it goes into the decision-making of which confessions go through. 

Hope everyone's been enjoying the stellar weather!

There is a generally popular opinion, that if someone is making something (album, iPhone game, movie, whatever), and you have heard of them/the product, then they have infinite money. This is really harmful to people who work in these fields, as a lot of them often times have difficulty paying say, rent from month to month. This article, while 3 years old, highlights how difficult it is to make it as an independent music group nowadays.

http://www.vulture.com/2012/09/grizzly-bear-shields.html

Ultimately, regardless of what your justification is for it, you're not entitled to any music, book, movie, TV show or whatever you want for free. If you truly have an issue with the way an industry is run, then don't buy it period. We exist in a world of essentially infinite entertainment at any given point so go download a free phone game, or steal your friends netflix password instead.

No one is probably  gonna give a shit but it is so infuriating how often people just feel like piracy is OK. If you're gonna do it fine, but don't try and self-justify yourself and make yourself out to be some sort of good person for doing so."

1317,2015-04-02 21:32:57,"Hey there, WashU! This is going to be a little late, but I didn't want to risk having this posted on the first and mistaken as some kind of April Fool's joke.

This month, as some of you might know, is Autism Awareness Month, and I wanted to talk a little about that. First of all, stereotypes of autism. I think most people are familiar with the image of the kid who bangs his head repeatedly on the wall or says one word over and over while ignoring everyone, the kid who can instantly tell you what day of the week 1/6/11 fell on but can't make up a story or talk consistently with anyone.

I want you to forget those images. Those are all, again, just stereotypes of autistic people. Autism itself isn't so simple. It's a very broad and diverse continuum of differences in processing and sensing. Autistic people can't be lumped in a single box; while parts of the spectrum can be severe, ""autistic"" is not synonymous with ""incapable"", ""unintelligent"", ""inhuman"", ""dumb"", or any of those other terrible words.

I wanted to say this because I have many, many autistic friends, and I am autistic myself.

I'm sure some of you guys are curious about what being autistic is like, so I'll try to describe it as best as I can. Keep in mind that, again, autism is a very diverse spectrum, and my experiences won't necessarily reflect the experiences of all autistics.

About emotions. I can feel them as strongly as anyone else does. My mind does lean towards the more logical side of things, which is probably why I'm in math and programming. But I do feel happy, anxious, depressed, and so on, even if it isn't immediately clear or if I don't show it. I was downright elated last week after surviving several tests in a row.

There's a misconception that autistic people can't feel empathy. That is so very not true. Sometimes I miss social cues showing that someone is irritated or sad, but if I see that someone's sad, I feel sad. If someone's sad because of me, I feel downright horrible about it. And we definitely do care about the feelings of others. One of my friends who's autistic has a lot of social anxiety and continuously worries about getting on people's nerves.

And, of course, when someone else is happy, I'm happy - and so I love to make people happy. :)

I mentioned earlier that autism is about processing information differently. What is that like for me? It's a bit hard to describe, and again, autistic experiences are wildly varied. But for me, where most people think in words, I think in relations and causations. Pure patterns, with no words attached. Everything exists in a giant, 3D web to me, this causes this causes this causes that. I can sort things into groups very quickly and instantly see very fine distinctions that most people overlook.

This is extremely helpful in programming, especially. Programming's all about solving problems by breaking them down into smaller and smaller problems that can be solved with very specific steps. I can't instantly tell you what day of the week 4/2/12 fell on - again, ""all autistics are savants"" is also a stereotype - but it's very easy for me to see how to convert the idea of a Caesar shift cipher into objects and instructions, and I can go through the program step by step and see how every line affects the others around it. I did in fact pull very high grades in CSE 131 and 132.

About socializing, I have a lot of trouble socializing. It just seems like my brain can't do small talk. Whenever I try, I inevitably blank out and it becomes really awkward. I also have a bad tendency to talk at the same time as other people, or wait too long to say something. I also do have hyper-focused interests, where I can talk to you all day about neurodiversity and neuroscience, but I'm at an utter loss when discussing other topics. It's like I traded the part that lets people socialize in exchange for better pattern-thinking. I've gotten better at conversation, but it still feels like a very mechanical process to me: I pay close attention to other people's conversations, memorize their responses to certain lines, and then in my own conversations, repeat the lines in accordance to what's said, like choosing dialogue in a game or something. Or acting in a play, as Temple Grandin put it.

By the way, if you haven't seen it before, you should really watch Temple Grandin's TED talk. Right here! http://www.ted.com/talks/temple_grandin_the_world_needs_all_kinds_of_minds?language=en

I'm keenly aware of my surroundings. I notice very small details right away that most people overlook. This can be a very good thing. It means I'm very precise, and I can get lost just watching a pinwheel spin in the sun and admiring how the shadows and light twirl around. It can also be a very stressful things, since I can't shut it off. In environments with very loud sounds, rapidly flashing lights, lots of smells, or lots of movement - environments that neurotypical people find tolerable or exciting - I can get overwhelmed by everything coming in and need to leave, otherwise I'll have a nervous meltdown.

It's not just the loaded environments, either. It's small things, too. I'm sure most of you have at least one pet peeve, at least one small thing that bugs you even though it seemingly shouldn't. It's sort of like that, but more intense. It's not just annoying - it's like poison ivy being rubbed across your mind. There's just something about some things, like sunlight making a glare on my computer, that causes my mind to get scrambled up and results in me getting incredibly anxious. I can't explain why for the life of me.

I do stim. Stimming is basically making small, repetitive actions over and over. Rocking, hand flapping, and repeating words are the most stereotypical variants of stimming, but stimming can also be things like leg jiggling, stroking a soft cloth over and over, lip-chewing, and twirling objects. As for why I do it, it's like scratching an itch. Or holding onto an anchor. It grounds me, somehow, it helps me think; it's like my mind's prone to getting tangled, and this untangles it and lays everything straight. It's very calming, and if I'm getting overloaded by something, it somehow vents off the anxiety. How: again, I can't explain.

So as you can see, being autistic doesn't mean I'm a robot made out of meat, or that I'm less aware, or less sentient, or less human. I'm a person just like you are, with some differences in how I think, use my senses, and calm myself. Autism is way more diverse than a kid who bangs their head on the wall and can't talk or otherwise function independently. Autism is a wide spectrum that not only includes people referred to as ""low-functioning""*, but everyday people like you and me, and also geeky but brilliant programmers, mathematicians, scientists, writers, and artists. People who may be awkward and react strangely to things, but are able to also see the world in a different way and put those talents to use for everyone. :)

*It should also be noted that one should be VERY careful with ""functioning"" labels. There's an unfortunate tendency to assume that it's all right to consider ""high-functioning"" autistics persons but then dehumanize those who are ""less functional"". Regardless of how able or ""functional"" someone is, a person is a person.

This is already a super long post. I'm sorry! If you've made it this far, thank you. Seriously. I just have one more thing to say, and that's about Autism Awareness Month itself.

Autism Awareness Month, while it seems innocuous at first, is actually really problematic. It was created and sponsored by Autism Speaks, a group that's also incredibly, incredibly problematic to the point of being considered a hate group by autistics and their allies. Here's a few facts regarding Autism Speaks:

* Autism Speaks does not have a single autistic member on their board.
* Autism Speaks spends only 3% of the money they raise back on helping families and autistic people.
* Autism Speaks produces advertisements, small films, etc. focusing on how autistic people are a burden to society, without letting autistics talk about their own experiences.
* Autism Speaks sponsored “Autism Every Day”, which featured a member of their board talking about contemplating murder-suicide of her daughter >in front of her daughter
This has now been removed from Autism Speaks’ Youtube channel.
* Autism Speaks is responsible for “I Am Autism”, a short film that features an ominous voice saying things like “I am autism… I know where you live… I work faster than pediatric AIDS, cancer, and diabetes combined… I will make sure your marriage fails.”
* Autism Speaks often promotes long-disproven statistics. For instance, that vaccines cause autism. (They don't, seriously, look it up.)
* Autism Speaks blocked the inclusion of the Shakowsky Amendment in the Autism CARES Act, which would have allowed autistics to further advocate for themselves and would have highlighted the intersecting needs of autistic people of color and other minorities.
* Autism Speaks has also allied themselves with the Judge Rotenberg Center, an institution that routinely uses electroshock on autistic people as punishment for even minor infractions.
* In short, Autism Speaks perpetuates a stereotype that autistic people are inferior, incapable, and less human, and cannot be trusted to make their own decisions and live their own lives.

And much more:

* https://thecaffeinatedautistic.wordpress.com/2013/03/05/why-i-am-against-autism-speaks-and-you-should-be-too-2/
There's not only information there, but links backing up all of those claims.

So, this month, please don't wear a puzzle piece, or buy fundraising candies from Autism Speaks, or otherwise support their activities. Instead of observing Autism Awareness Month, celebrate Autism Acceptance Month. Talk to someone who's autistic, or drop by ASAN, aka the Autistic Self-Advocacy Network. Don't stigmatize, but learn.

Thank you for reading! :)

PS: And I want to say thank you to the person/people who posted about being a multiple a week ago, and all the people who supported that post. You all inspired me to write this. Stay awesome!"
1318,2015-04-02 21:49:58,"Sometimes I just feel so jealous seeing my super outgoing friends make such intimate, meaningful connections with so many people seemingly effortlessly when I struggle so much to make deeper relations. It would be nice to know that I've made a real positive impact in someone's life, to have someone explicitly say that they value my friendship.

But I realized there are probably people in my life who feel the same way. So I'm trying to make an effort to really explicitly say to all the people in my life what they mean to me and how much I appreciate them. It's kinda hard since I'm a bit awkward, but hopefully it'll get easier the more I do it. I would urge everyone to do the same, especially with those friends you're not as close with or don't see as often. You never know what it could mean to someone to hear that they are appreciated or that they've really positively impacted another person's life."

Here goes: Over spring break I broke up with my girlfriend since high school because I finally accepted that I'm gay. She thought I was making it up as an excuse and freaked out and told everyone from our school, and basically dragged my name through the mud, also outing me in the process. But I've put that bitch behind me and am now having a great time hooking up with dudes. Holla at me on Grindr, fellas.

I tend to carry all my burdens by myself, because I do not want others to think I am weak. Yeah, I know it is funny and unhealthy, but I thought I have a high mental strength (if it even makes sense) and I could handle everything.

Turns out I cannot. I needed someone to rely on, and to tell what's going on recently. I saw confession 2469 and called my parents immediately.

As I am living away from them, I did not want them to worry about me and always told them I am doing well while I really was not.
But when I told them that I am having hard time and I do not know what to do, they told me they knew I am pretending I am okay, and I don't have to do that. They told me whenever I have hard time, just call them and talk about the problems. After an hour or so, I felt much better.

So talk to your parents. Talk to your friends. Talk to somebody.
It is extremely helpful."

I think they're starting to catch on..."
1332,2015-03-31 14:34:34,"i read @2469 at 2:00 AM and called my parents per the advice of the confession. Turns out they weren't asleep, and we just hung up after a hilarious conversation.  It's 3:38 AM.  Thanks OP!"
1333,2015-03-31 14:11:35,"I realized this morning that the only reason I get up in the morning is because of obligation; I used to be able to tell myself things like, ""You get to study at one of the best universities in the US,"" ""You might learn a new way of thinking today, maybe make a ground breaking personal discovery,"" ""You're so lucky/privileged,"" and to take advantage of this first rate education. Generally, learning things is cool and fun, but that whole outlook hinges on wanting to learn, and learning being a good thing. I came to WashU happy to learn and ready to do it, and now I don't think I want to anymore. Learning is still useful, but not fun. I hate that I used to love some subjects and appreciated learning about them, appreciated what they had to offer, but a lot of those loves are gone because of how stressful learning is here.

A number of professors have told me that I shouldn't be so concerned about grades, and to just make sure I learn the material. Maybe I'm being obtuse, but yeah, I like challenging material. It's interesting. I want to learn about it. I also think it would be awesome if I could just learn the material without worrying about the class kicking my ass so much that I started to hate the entire process and its fruits. Bio happens to be a great example. The problem with an intro-level weed-out course is that if you hate the course, you don't know if you hate the material or the class. If you fight through it and get to upper-level bio courses (reportedly easier), then you might finally discover that you hate biology, not just the weed-out nature of past classes.

That's just one isolated example, but the trend is the same: my happiness is competing with my potential for success (and success is still defined by my GPA), and I don't think it's worth staying here for that. I know I'm #blessed, but it sure as hell doesn't feel like it sometimes. I just want to learn without the question, ""What did I get on that?"" occupying more of my mind than the material for the class."

Graduation isn't just important to me, it is a significant day for everyone who helped me get this far. It means the world to my parents. And it is so sad that a student like me should have to fear that a special day like the one coming up in May might be used as a platform to protest ferguson/police brutality/race issues. It isn't the time or place, and I just wish my fellow students could be counted on to be on their best behavior for just 1 day. I called my parents today to warn them that it is likely some sort of protest/chant thing will occur, and it really broke my heart to tell them that they special day they are flying here for might be marred by the actions of a few, likely with the approval (or at least silence) of the university."

You know, a fairly typical immigrant-parent situation.

The last time I remember her really feeling proud of me, letting me know she was proud of me, was when I graduated high school. That was four years ago. Doesn't happen much.

But. Two years ago I started ending phone calls with her saying ""I love you"" to which she awkwardly replies ""I love you too."" And tonight she said ""I love you"" to me first.  That's the first time I remember her saying that to me without me having to say it first since I was in elementary school.

I come from an income bracket that does not qualify me for financial support, and my parents have worked incredibly hard for years in order to have enough saved to put me through college. They've sacrificed so much for the sake of my education and that of my siblings. They've also been an emotional and spiritual anchor for me during hard times. I owe them so much. My graduation is just as much their victory as it is mine.

1347,2015-03-28 13:51:57,"I know that SHS seems to have a bad reputation in regards to their services (especially mental health services), but I wanted to confess that I have been genuinely astounded this past week at how dedicated they were and still are to helping me solve my own medical problems.

Disclaimer: I did not go to SHS for their mental health services, so I can't speak to that. Also, my story may not be representative of the general attitudes of SHS patients, it really is just one case study.

However, I do want to share my SHS story. I went to go to see a doctor because of concerns of lumps and nodes being in places they shouldn't be. I made an appointment and was seen within a week of calling. I was initially hoping to just be referred to Barnes, because I didn't think SHS would have the staff or training required for my problem (I also didn't have the confidence that SHS would be professional enough to take me seriously, as my home doctor told me nothing was wrong despite my atypical symptoms).

Lo and behold, the doctor the nurses signed me up for was a specialist for my exact problem. At SHS. No Barnes needed (for now at least). She was very professional and got me in for some blood testing that very day, and a scan later this week. As results have been coming in from the blood tests, she and I have been emailing back and forth EVERY DAY to discuss my options, going to Barnes, getting a biopsy, what treatment SHS can offer with its more convenient location, etc. She's creating a team of doctors for me to be properly treated. Unlike my home doctor, she took me seriously, did the necessary tests, and found out that something was wrong and I wasn't just ""exaggerating"" or ""making up"" my symptoms (really not a fan of home doctor at this point, if you can't tell). Did I mention this doctor, who I've only ever met that once, has been in contact with me EVERY DAY since my appointment?? I've gotten emails back from her before 8am to after 7pm when she really doesn't have to be working. This lady is amazing. I just want to give all of SHS a huge round of applause, for meeting my health needs and for going above and beyond to make me feel comfortable, safe, and confident in their skills of diagnosing and treating me.

SHS really is, in my experience, much better than I had been led to believe by their general reputation. Thank you, staff at SHS, for putting my mind at ease, taking me seriously as a patient, and working hard for me to become healthy again! I couldn't do this without you!

TLDR: SHS came through for me, doctors there are great, and I'm a happy camper. Hoping other people who are thinking about seeking treatment for anything will give them a chance. They might just surprise you and be 100% awesome doctors, nurses, and staff."

And if you suspect someone is struggling, genuinely ask them how they are. Not any of that bullshit you say when you're walking past someone. Show them you care.

1352,2015-03-26 19:20:15,"As Mental Health Awareness Week draws to a close, I wanted to share my secret. I'm a multiple.

Or, I should say, *we* are a multiple (system). For those of you who don't know what that means, it means that functionally, this brain either contains or strongly appears to contain multiple people. This is most commonly seen in dissociative identity disorder (DID), but DID isn't the only way to be multiple. (For those who have seen it, ""Sybil"" the film/book is grievously sensationalized and should not be taken as a serious source of information on multiplicity.) DID applies to systems who have difficulty functioning because they are multiple; we function just fine and thus fall under the category of ""healthy multiplicity"".

I know this is hard to swallow, so if you're in doubt about whether this all is real, here's a few articles.

In which a body is sighted or blind depending on which member of the system is at front: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17611729

Other strange effects caused by system members switching (handedness changing, speaking different languages): http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2766827/

Psychological treatment manual stating that systems do not need to integrate (be merged together) in order to be healthy: http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03069885.2011.564606

Another study showing, again, that singularity is not needed in order to be healthy: http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/a0026487

If you're still interested, a ""layman's guide"" on multiplicity, by a healthy multiple system: http://www.karitas.net/blackbirds/layman/
and a collection of sites by healthy multiples: http://healthymultiplicity.com/

(By the way, please, *please* take anything you read on tumblr about multiplicity with a generous pinch of salt. There's so much misinformation and drama there and to quote a friend, that site's made an utter farce out of everything.)

Some systems start out disordered (DID) and become healthy. We were always functional. I experienced a great deal of abuse I'm still recovering from, which may have caused them to arise in the first place, but we were lucky in that we could communicate and keep our memories. And by working together, we were able to keep down any hostile members who emerged. Now there's seven of us and we work together. We know some DID systems who struggle with being multiple, who struggle with memory loss, malicious members, infighting, and thank our stars every day that things turned out well for us.

The others in this head... Are they fragments? Are they other consciousnesses? Are they spirits? I don't know. But I can say they're more than ""just delusions"". One took over during a panic attack I had. He held on and spoke to me until I calmed down, at which point he gave control back. Several others come in to help with homework on a regular basis, and when they do, I'll drift away and come back to a page I don't remember writing. In my opinion, they are as equally imaginary and as equally real as I am.

Why am I sharing this if we're a healthy system? Representation. There's not much information out there on healthy multiplicity, and a massive stigma on being multiple. In the public eye, *all* multiples *must* be disordered in some way, *must* contain a serial killer, and can *only* be healthy if they integrate, all of which are very untrue. If we come out, we risk being accused of ""faking"", of ""looking for attention"", and at worst we can have our driver's license revoked and forced into ""treatment"". Like a lot of other systems, we hide and appear to be, to the outer eye, one singular person. Every day, we wonder how many are out there who are like us, especially on this campus.

We are never alone, but sometimes, it gets lonely."

Obviously if someone has a weapon on you and demands money the safest thing to do is comply. And obviously the money in your wallet is not worth dying for. I'm not arguing that. And I'm not blaming the Wash U administration for trying to keep us safe. But to me it just seems like such a sad thing when good, innocent people are told to just do what a criminal says simply because it's easier.

Maybe I'm reading too much into this one line and maybe it's nothing, but to me it seems to highlight a trend in our society today. I wish more people stressed the importance of self-defense (whether it's through pepper spray or karate lessons or even firearms, whatever), especially for women (I'm a girl.) A lot of times we hear ""well, you should teach your sons not to rape and murder and steal"", and I'm all for that. Two thumbs up. But in the meantime, why don't we ever hear ""teach your daughters how to defend themselves""? It makes me so angry that I should have to be scared of people who would want do me harm.

That's why when I see people making a mess/not cleaning up for themselves, it fucking pisses me off. Stop making a job that is already hard to do even harder. To be able to submit yourself to picking up after others is a type of humility and fortitude that I greatly admire. I don't know if it's out of elitism or pure willful ignorance, but people just don't care about what they have to do. How do you think they feel when they have to constantly clean up after a bunch of college students who act like 5 year olds?

1377,2015-03-19 22:07:57,"If any incoming freshmen follow this page, I hope you get the chance to read this.

WashU is a great school. It's been called ""Harvard of the Midwest"" among other titles. Sadly it's still not as big a household name like many other top schools in US News despite ranking higher than several of them. Before I started here, people have told me time and time again that even though the average person doesn't know about WashU, the people who matter do (i.e. Employers, grad school admissions, etc.). Well here I am, 4 years later, working at a Fortune 50 company, and practically no one in my office has heard of WashU, nor do I think they care. But the strangest part might be the fact that I really don't care either.

You might find this shocking but this is the truth of the post-college world that I learned about towards my senior year: people who boast about what school they went to give off the impression that their best accomplishments are behind them. The only time I mention it is when people specifically ask me and even then, I might just say ""I went to school in St. Louis.""

Similarly, in light of catching up with some buddies now in med school and reading some recents posts about med school, I've thought about the value of going to a prestigious school, and I know that it's both an asset and a liability.

Telling people you go to WashU projects the image that you're smart/talented/elitist. The challenge is going to how to back up that image; not an easy task when you'll be surrounded by peers with similar capabilities. The reason I bring this up is because I've heard countless times of people thinking it's okay to keep getting B's and C's in classes because they go to WashU. Well it's not okay. When an employer or grad school admissions looks at your transcript, going to WashU won't compensate for a GPA of barely 3.0 or below, especially you're likely going to be competing with a classmate who has a GPA of 3.5+.

My point is if you're going to attend a school like WashU, make sure that you can handle it. Like it is with many other top tier schools, students here are held to a very high standard. When you choose to come to such a school, you made a commitment, and applying for a job or grad school with a subpar GPA means you've failed to follow through on your own commitment. Similarly, stop telling your friends or yourself when you do poorly on a test that it's fine because you're at WashU. Don't delude yourself by thinking a B/C here is like an A+ at some other school; a B/C is a B/C everywhere you go unless you're comparing yourself to an institution that uses a different grading criteria.

I say this because I know what it's like to be a recent high school grad enticed by the thought of going to a prestigious college. I've learned now, perhaps a little too late, that no matter what happens, you have to earn your own success, and you won't accomplish that by sitting around thinking it'll all come to you simply because you go to WashU."

It's total fucking bullshit that WashU has a premed attrition rate of ~2/3  and even among the people who stick it out only a small fraction make GPAs competitive for the top tier of med schools. (Yeah, we're good at getting people in somewhere and there is a small WashU bump for midlevel schools, but places like WashU Med, Penn, Harvard have no tolerance for lower numbers and accept classes with 3.9 median science GPAs. A mid 3.X is lethal; of the people accepted to WashU Med last year, only 10% had a 3.7 or lower).

Now I recently got curious and used the GPA/MCAT grid data in the Prehealth Handbook and AAMC Table 24 to try and see just how much Wustl students get fucked by being pitted against each other for limited high grades instead of against nationally average students. Guess what? When you approximately line up the two populations' performance on the MCAT (the Great Equalizer!) you see that WashU GPAs are lower by AT LEAST 0.6, which in the realm of premed GPAs is the difference between competitive for the best schools and barely competitive anywhere!

Extra bonus:

Nationwide the ratio of 3.8+ GPA / 36+ MCAT is 3.2
At Wash U the ratio is 0.7
That's right! We have more people scoring 97th+ fucking percentile on the MCAT than being awarded strongly competitive grades.

So, in conclusion, it makes no sense to grade harshly and weed out the number of premeds we do. We really need to start inflating the hell out of our grades Harvard/Brown/Rice style! I know I'll tell my siblings to seriously consider the scholarship to a decent state school if they plan to play the premed game - numbers just matter too much.

Sure, a good portion of the food does have the correct nutrition labels (if you can find it online), but it would be nice to know that, say, a certain nut oil extract is in the bread or that they changed the soup recipe without updating the online menu.

1396,2015-03-17 15:12:40,"Got told by someone I care very much about that I have a drug abuse problem. And she's not wrong. I abuse drugs. Maybe it's college. Maybe it's a problem. I don't even know enough about where I am on that specturm to say. It involves all types, from booze to weed to psychedelics to benzos to stimulants. Some are for fun, some are to not have to deal, and a lot of times it feels like that line gets blurred every Friday and Saturday (and let's be real, most Thursday nights too). 

Used to smoke almost every day but then it stopped being fun and I admitted to that last week. I'm not stopping entirely, I'm just cutting back, and I've talked to enough professionals and been in enough groups to know that pretty much every addict says that, and so do people who don't have a problem. The (non-scientific, experience-based) definition of addiction is surprisingly unclear, even amongst recovering addicts. Everyone has their own line, is what I've found. Almost everyone who talks about addiction says ""oh this is or isn't addictive"". What makes something addictive, has, in my own experience, been something that fills a missing space that nothing else, substance or otherwise, could. It has very little to do with whether or not that substance is known to cause chemical dependency. I don't want to stop because it's fun, but I've started noticing a pattern that I keep letting the people I care most about down and hurting them through my use of one substance or another. Maybe if I just toned it down. Maybe if I just stopped all-together. 

My worry is summed up in a saying recovering addicts have: ""It wasn't a problem until it was a problem"". The lines between a hard partier and someone who is damaging themselves are razor thin, and the various contradictory societal perceptions of drug and alcohol use don't help at all. I already lost one friendship because of my use, but my other friends (who don't use) say that person was overreacting. I don't think the person was. But really, I don't know what to think.

I apologize for the stream of consciousness. Just had to get it out of my head."

Pre med and med school programs focus on heavy memorization in order to turn students into human databases that can effectively diagnose diseases. Google has billions of times more information than any human could memorize, and it is accessible to most people at the swipe of a screen. There will even be robots that can do almost any surgery. Has anyone ever gotten Lasik surgery? The machine does everything and the doctor doesn't do much at all. Long story short, I think I'm gonna become an engineer so that my skills do not become obsolete."

1401,2015-03-17 07:19:48,"It's completely hypocritical to say that people shouldn't be able to express their political opinions on WU Confessions. If you're conservative or even slightly less liberal than the top commentators you will be singled out for expressing your opinions and there are real repercussions if you ""offend"" someone. Keep in mind that our school has a few oversensitive pricks who think they're super intelligent and entitled to their feelings being catered to.

It's a joke to say that it's fair and that ""a conservative who expresses their opinion shouldn't expect nobody to contest it."" Everyone knows that when a conservative speaks up about their beliefs it goes beyond normal depute. People can report them to our school's ""bias reporting system"" and even if they don't in today's day and time big time individuals get in trouble for their opinions, for example: the Mozillla CEO who voted Yes on 8, artist Pharrell Williams got media hatred for expressing his views on Ferguson and now even two gay fashion designers can't say they don't believe in artificial insemination. If the students on this campus don't provide a ""safe zone"" for conservatives to speak (because that's equality right? If one group has one then others should too!) then they can expect another WashU confessions page to be set up, separate from yours.

All I am saying is, tell it for what it really is. Our school is full of liberals who get upset over the few and mild conservative opinions on here (I have yet to see a confession that says, ""I hate black people"". None are so horrid.) You say you believe in equality? You say you ""believe in freedom of speech, but..."" No! I am sorry but you do not believe in freedom of speech. Tell it for what it really is, whatever your beliefs, whatever your agenda, you do not believe in freedom at least not for conservatives, white males, the wealthy, the christian, etc. There's going to be backlash."

I was in a place I thought was impossible to get out of, fighting a losing battle. This was the weakest, lowest point of my life. I thought it was okay for a while because everywhere I looked, I saw depression and self-harm romanticized and seen as “tragically beautiful.” They are not. They are ugly, ugly diseases and wreak havoc on all the lives they touch.

This has been by far the hardest year of my life, it has been a battle every day. But now I’m winning this battle.

Still, I've realized that much of the blame of my anxiety falls on the insecurities thrust upon me by our campus community.  Everyone constantly competes over everything - the amount of sleep, stress, or our intelligence level (grades, number of credits).  None of these things are the same for everyone, so why do we constantly need to push them in one another's faces?

After the last two semesters, I've realized that I should only be taking 12-15 credits to keep myself mentally sane.  I need 6-8 hours of sleep each night to function well in the classroom, while others might not need the same.  Whenever someone tries to argue with me about the amount of tests they have next week and how I don't deserve to be under as much stress as them, I now just stop listening.  If you need to go to office hours, go!  If you don't, however, then don't - you don't need to criticize those that might not have understood the material as well as you.

If society encourages us to stop comparing our body sizes and appearance, we should also stop comparing the rest of our experiences.  Life is to be lived as one's own journey with the involvement and contributions of others, but our lives should not be lived in order to exactly mirror others.  Your entire experience at WashU is yours to create, so don't feel like you should or should not do something because of someone else - do it for you!"

I work a job on campus and I make money for myself (I have almost a full financial aid package), and then I spend it at the bar, to the detriment of other things. Sometimes I skip meals so I'll have more money for alcohol. Sometimes I take old food that's half eaten that I find lying around. I certainly never buy anything like clothes anymore, and I take my medicines every other day instead of every day so I don't have to pay for refills as often. I have even blown my entire savings from my summer job on the bar.  I know which drinks will get me drunk for the least amount of money.

I'm just writing this because I'd like to say that, before you judge someone for supposedly having a lot of money to spend at the bar, maybe consider instead that they might have a drinking problem and reach out to them for help. Because I know that I've heard a thousand times ""oh it must be nice to have so much money to spend on alcohol"" but I've never once heard ""I've noticed you spend almost every night at the bar, are you doing ok?"" Just something to consider."

It scares me to see someone say on yik yak that they support protestors who are polite, regardless of their positions. Sometimes, change comes with offensive or inconvenient protest and debate.

1444,2015-03-02 20:08:21,"I confess that I am troubled by some of the posts concerning the disparity between economic status of WashU students.

Specifically, I am referring to the ones revealing that some students are appalled and/or offended when they learn that their classmates are able to afford tuition here, or hear them discussing how much money they have to spare for amusements.

I completely understand how unfair it seems that some students can coast on their parents' money while others must take out loans and work jobs just to make ends meet. However, what I would like to point out is that some parents (like mine) worked multiple jobs throughout their entire lives with the goal of not only making enough money to live by, but also saving up to be able to help out their children with as much of their college expenses as possible. My parents both started out working menial jobs; then, my mom put my dad through graduate school before having any children; and my family has never gone on vacation in order to continue saving money. Although my parents are unable to pay for all four of my years here, I have been able to afford the first several semesters, and I deeply cherish every single dollar they have been able to provide for me through their sweat, tears, and long hours.

I understand that for people from other socioeconomic backgrounds, the fact that I could even afford one year here may be unbelievable, and I am very aware of how fortunate and privileged I am. I am also aware of how taxing it is to try to juggle school with work, especially since I will have to start doing that from now on. But should I really have to apologize for being able to pay for my tuition so far? Should I have to apologize for my parents' hard work, and being able to use their money to pay for my expenses?

I guess I'm just tired of feeling like I have to justify myself for having any money at all that's not my own. (If you think about it, if society got rid of the ability to pass on our earnings, then no one would ever work more than how much they need to in order to barely get by.) So, what I'm trying to say is that you shouldn't always assume that just because someone can afford tuition here, it means they've always had it easy and they're oblivious of their good fortune."

My parents worked hard to be where they are now and I will have to too. I'm not a materialistic person and try to save money as often as possible so when people say ""Oh but you can afford that because you're rich"" in a condescending tone it ticks me off."

1463,2015-02-25 23:21:52,"This school claims to be so open-minded... but that's really not true. Here's what I mean:

I'm now a Junior, and at my time at WashU, I've considered applying/running for honoraries and SU stuff and such. However, I never actually went through with any of those. I was afraid that my political views (center to center-right) would cause me to be shunned by others in those groups.

And I know a bunch of y'all probably want to comment on this and say that that's not true and all of these groups are open to other opinions. This is very much not my experience. In earlier years, I would have considered myself a member of Pride Alliance. Now, though, I haven't been to a meeting in over a year because when I went, I would always feel out of place. I never felt comfortable to share my opinion.

The bigger problem is that this political closed-mindedness is really delaying progress. I'm very socially liberal: pro same-sex marriage, pro choice, and I've been (somewhat) active in the Black Lives Matter movement. I really want to see social progress, but this is not the way to do it. When you shun those with other ideas, you only discuss with people who agree with you. A monologue won't solve anything. The only way we can actually make a change happen is if we engage in a dialogue: every opinion has a reason behind it. Yelling at people to ""check [their] privilege"" without even explaining what that means turns a potential discussion into a monologue, and is only inflammatory to social conservatives.

I'm all about what we do here at this school: we really fight for justice and equality. But the approaches many of the student groups take to address these issues is flawed and counterproductive."

1476,2015-02-24 00:53:24,"Since I didn't make RA it's likely that I will not be able to come back to WashU next year because my parents were barely able to scrape by this year, next year we will legitimately not have enough money to pay for this university and for my sister to attend school. Through this anonymous message board I am comfortable enough to admit that my mother is a layed-off teacher who can't find a job (no one is hiring, trust me she's applied to every teaching job available within 50 miles of where we live) and my father is a IT specialist who makes less than $50,000 a year supporting my family of 4. He worked hard his whole life and saved enough for me to go to a cheap public school, but thanks to my initial scholarship here my dream to reach higher became a reality. But with the cost going up next year (again) and my sister going off to college too, I will either need a miracle from the financial aid office or a winning lottery ticket. Preferably the second one.

Anyway, I asked my RCD why he thought I didn't make it and he says that it was likely due to the party I had been written up for in my suite. Funny thing is, that never happened. My roommates used my name as a scapegoat and never bothered telling me, and because it was an RA from a different floor who busted it up they had no idea that they were being lied to by my roommates. There's no appeals process for being an RA and I'm sure that if I didn't have to do work-study to keep up financially I could have been more involved in the social justice causes that I care about and that reflects well when applying to be an RA. The selection process apparently doesn't account for that. Overall, I'm well and truly fucked for next year."
1477,2015-02-23 18:57:25,"Wow. A top care worker said ""Hey girl"" not sure if this is even an issue. He's a human not a man beast. If a student had said this it wouldn't have been a problem. I am not saying cat-calling is okay (its very unflattering and can make people feel uncomfortable) but overall had a student did this it wouldn't have been given a second thought. Quite frankly, NO ONE should be catcalling because its degrading and immature.

I bring this issue up because until recently top care workers were instructed not to talk to students at all. Like they are lesser or do not have the grace by which to be amongst us. They are human. Just because they shovel dirt doesn't make them dirt.

They make this campus beautiful so instead of scurrying by in the mornings or afternoons, why not say a quick ""good morning"" or ""afternoon"" or ""how are you doing?"" treat them how you would treat your professors; be a decent human being don't just ignore them.

I have a related confession:

Last semester, I was walking back to my dorm while reading a text from one of my parents with good news. I was smiling because of this and as I walked down the sidewalk, all of a sudden I heard one of the employees say ""what are you smiling about, whore?"" I was so shocked and upset, but we were the only two people nearby so I just walked quickly away trying not to look at him. The incident really upset me because up until that point, all of the WU employees had been so friendly and nice and this was just disgusting. I'm upset that I didn't speak up and even more upset that something happened to another student possibly by the same man."

I know it's petty and I know it wouldn't make him want me back, but I keep thinking about how good it would feel to know that he's aware that, after all those years of me thinking that he was my everything, I'm not just moving on. I'm succeeding."

Due to this, I have to take things easy sometimes, but I'm tired of people who don't know me very well sneering at my lighter course load or when I have to miss class or meetings because I just can't bring myself to get out of bed or show my face in public. And when these people judge me or talk behind my back and I hear about it, or if they even say off-hand comments at me, it just makes everything so much worse. I'm glad you are Type A and just got into med school and working two jobs, or if you're struggling with depression too and doing a good job, you can't judge me or my life choices. Just remember that next time you give someone shit or act like you're so high and mighty.

To be fair,  I am basing this purely off the confessions I see on this page, which may not be representative of the overall student body.

As part of the 0.5 generation I'm in the position that I feel comfortable between each group, but I could never find a sweet spot that brings the two together. I understand there are cultural differences and things but I've always had the mentality that coming abroad for school is as much a cultural experience as a academic experience.

On the other hand, my family is falling apart as a result of a divorce and some of my siblings academic performance. The worst part of it all is that everyone including my own parents are looking up to me for help when I can't do anything when I am so far away. I feel like a failure but I know that I couldnt have foreseen it. It eats me up inside seeing them struggle and the only way I can support them is by doing well in school and hope that they can be strong enough until I can support them with my own income.

I say this for two reasons: 1) I just want to get this off my chest. It was something that I wanted to get out even if no one knows who I am. 2) Be kind to people. You don't know what they are going through and the secrets that they might be concealing. A smile can go a long way."

Mind you, I am a returning client, so its not like I have to wait the normal amount of time before seeing someone new. The first appointment I got is a week from tomorrow, and thats just waiting another agonizing week before being able to feel better. Meanwhile, this week has been the worst week I've ever had at WashU, academically, with extracurriculars, and also received crushing news about an application decision. It would have been nice to have been able to start this medication weeks ago, in order to not have to deal with crippling depression on top of everything else this week. (Or at least feel able to cope with the week better.)

I guess what Im trying to say is, the mental health resources at SHS are horrible, and the process should not take this frustratingly long. This needs to be fixed, and students should feel like they have hope in recovering from any illness, whether it be physical or mental. Mental health issues should be treated just as seriously as physical health issues."

I curtly replied, ""Why?""  He looked startled but said, ""Do you know this person?"" and held out a (presumably dropped) wallet with a drivers license. I said, again curtly, ""No, I don't know any of my neighbors.""

Whoever you were, I'm sorry if I came across as rude/abrupt/angry.  As a female, I'm always super guarded and uptight when addressed by unknown people in public, especially if they're male, no matter how good their intentions seem (and realistically, probably are).  My behavior is probably irrational to a degree, but I as well as my family/friends/peers have had enough close calls with random people (the majority have been with men, but women certainly aren't innocent either) that that's just how I behave.  I wish it could be not that way, and that creepy people didn't exist, and that everyone could be trusted, but I guess we're all products of our surroundings in a lot of ways and it's better to be safe than sorry.

My main point isn't to explain/justify how I act, but to say to the guy who I assume was being good samaritan and trying to find the owner of the wallet: If you happen read this, thank you for doing the right thing and don't be put off from doing good by one crotchety person who rains on the parade.

(Also, if you lost your wallet in the Kingsbury/Washington Avenue/Melville/Kingsland area on/before February 19 around 4:30pm, the last name on the ID began with an M and looked eastern European and I *think* the first name was Michael.)"

This always occurs, I would truly like to actually meet a person, just one person who would just say what was on his/her mind instead of playing into political correctness, and affecting themselves with a fake personality.

I told them that I don't feel like I am viewed as a full person.

I have yet to meet another like myself as washu, but As a fresh immigrant who come from a low income family and had to learn english from scratch, i'm so grateful that WashU had accepted me. True that washu has a need aware admission, but for the students that they do admit, they give out very generous scholarship that allows me to live a comfortable, luxurius even, life whch i would not be able to if i did not go to washu. True that i have to supply my income with research stipen in the summer and TA jobs during the semester, but they are jobs which also give experience and helps build resume.

That said, I still don't believe the government should subsidize all private colleges (there's public schooling for that) beyond what they already do for grants, loans, etc.
If I didn't get aid here, I wouldn't whine and bitch about inequality and say the gov't should pay for me, I'd get a job and go to a community college, do well, and transfer to either a 4 year or trade school.

1509,2015-02-18 21:46:28,"I just got off the phone with my dad. The topic was money.

I'm crushed. I wanna break down and cry. Lack of money is crushing me.

My dad demands that I receive all B's or better (which is manageable and doable, but still hard), but he also expects $5000 from me (I have about $200 to my name) and I'm trying to get a job to at least do something.

I told him I found a house off campus for ~$830 a month. He freaked out, like really freaked out. Until I told him that the cheapest washu housing was the same amount except for 8.5 or 9 months.

Honestly I can handle school. I can handle the loneliness and the workload of WashU. I can't handle the money. I can't handle having it constantly looming over me. And yet, the only thing I can do is keep trying. If I don't at least try I'm doomed to fail.

1510,2015-02-18 21:34:29,"Amid the flow of recent confessions that have been discussing the tuition of WashU, and college tuition in general, I started to think more about how I got here. My father used to work at the medical school and retired a few years ago with all of his benefits. Namely, that all of his direct family members get 4 years of free tuition at WashU. I was accepted last spring with a pretty average (by WashU's standards) application. 32 ACT, 3.9 GPA with good course rigor, and solid extra curriculars.

My question is for all of the people bashing WashU for being a money-hoarding institution. Why would they accept me? My father had already retired so clearly it was not to please him. And I'm sure there were plenty of other applicants who were just as qualified as me, if not more so, that would have paid the whole $45,700 a year. Maybe there was something they saw in my application that I'm just not connecting, but I did a LOT of research during the college application process and I genuinely think there were plenty of other equally qualified applicants who would have paid the full tuition. I guess my question is why me? Obviously you can't answer that because you don't know me, but in general, why would they do something like this if WashU is solely a financially driven institution?"

1513,2015-02-18 16:43:35,"Post as a new confession or a response to 2299.  Not sure which, just want people to stop kidding themselves about this whole ""subsidize college crap""

No one wants to say it?  Well then.  Guess I'll be the bad guy.  The cold hard truth is that the world will always need McDonald's employees and Taxi Drivers and Delivery People and Retail Cashiers.  Imagine for a second that our government spent millions (maybe even billions) to give all the McDonald's employees college degrees which they then never used.  You all who payed for that would be screaming in the streets.  Not to mention, high paying jobs would just start wanting to see a graduate degree.  The fact is, there is will always be two stages in education.  The baseline that you must reach to be a healthy functioning adult (can we all agree that's definitely 8th grade if not high school?).  And then the extra that high profile jobs look for because they want to know you're a cut above the rest (in pursuit of knowledge and socioeconomic standing).  So fine, go ahead and subsidize college.  Move the ""baseline"" I talked about to a college degree.  See if that really changes anything...

TLDR.  Subsidizing college will dilute its value.  A college degree will become the new High School diploma and graduate degree will be the new college degree."

1515,2015-02-18 00:20:38,"I don't really understand the whole push for the gov to pick up our tuition bills that people are making on here. Frankly, if my parents weren't helping, I would have just gone to a state school. There is absolutely zero ""need"" to be here. No one at Washu ""needs"" to be at Washu. Simple fact. Frankly, the whole national push for everyone to be going to college at all is enormously overrated. Millions of people our age are getting scammed into getting crappy degrees from crappy schools in order to get crappy jobs that pay crappy salaries lower than what they could make coming out of trade school. I know this for a fact, given that I was raised by a blue collar family.

Also, if the government were to ever start subsidizing college education, they should absolutely be allowed to specify certain majors. If my tax dollars are going to help someone get a college degree, it had better be STEM; there is no way I'm helping to subsidize someone's humanities degree. If you want one of those (note that I'm excluding business here), you should be on your own. A humanities degree is a luxury item; if we start subsidizing those, the gov should also start picking up the tab on the beer I have with dinner every night. What a ridiculous notion that society should pay for you to learn whatever you want, regardless of the future utility of that degree to society.

Last but not least, a few people on here-in response to the comments about high tuition-have suggested a student strike on classes. Genius. Stick it to the man by skipping the lectures you already paid for. That way, you'll have high tuition, but you'll also know less and be less likely to get a job that would help you pay off your loans. Absolutely genius. Believe me, I understand the desire to skip class, especially on these cold mornings, but is that actually how anyone here thinks they will be able to stick it to the school?"

I was the one to break it off, but I feel worse than I did before. My ex is really a great person, and I couldn't think any higher of them, but small things nagged at me about our relationship and I just broke it off. They said some really sad things when I told them I wanted to end our relationship. I feel so bad every time I think about it. And after all this, I selfishly still hope I can still be friends with them. Sorry for the rant. I just wanted to tell someone."
1517,2015-02-17 16:00:41,"I confess that for just one year I want the university to cut all funding for student groups, social activities, landscaping, etc - basically anything that is non-essential to basic academics - and use that money to build a network of underground tunnels connecting all the buildings on campus.

I'm not even sure why I'm doing this because he's often irresponsible and childish, isn't particularly interested in my life as far as I can tell, has compartmentalized me to an extent that we can't just sit and watch a movie together, and isn't really ever there for me if and when I need him though I am always there for him. He is also, however, incredibly kind, intelligent, curious, creative, and thoughtful, and we usually have so much fun together.

I know that it isn't a problem with either one of us.  It isn't my fault or his.  I don't feel like I need him and I don't think it's that I want him to change.  I just, for some reason, really want him there.  I don't really know what to do anymore."
1525,2015-02-16 20:50:55,"So after reading these posts about tuition I have something to say to the contrary.  Yes tuition being high sucks.  I wish it was lower, but to be honest the only way private university tuition could ever be lower would be to have the government subsidize it (which I think would be a worthy use of taxpayer money).  That's how state universities are able to charge low rates.  Harvard tuition is $43938. WUSTL is $45700. Northwestern tuition is $46836 (even higher than WUSTL)

Yes every dollar  matters but when you look at it, every top private university has similar tuition fees.  And honestly, WUSTL has one of the prettiest campus's in America (in this poster's opinion).  That upkeep costs extra money that comes from tuition as well as paying professors decent salaries and proving for everything else.  Do I think college should be affordable? yes.  Do I think there is any other option besides government subsidy? no.

And another thing, at the end of the day you're not just paying for better professors, you could go to a free public library and get the best professors ever in between the pages of a book.  you're paying to be in a top academic environment with brilliant peers who also want to learn.  That changes the dynamics  of your learning in subtle ways that are hard to detect when not looking.  So think about that next time you're determining the value of your education at WUSTL."

Why do you feel a need to post on Facebook immediately about this?"
1529,2015-02-16 18:56:11,"I've always been comfortably well off, financially. I've never had to work a part time job, and I've never been tied down or held back for financial reasons. My one duty in life has been to study, and I've done a decent enough job at it. But this year, for some various reasons, I decided to cut off a large portion of my pocket money from myself. My family is still very well off, but in terms of immediate money that I can use for my own personal benefit, whenever and on whatever I want, I have very little. It's opened my eyes up to a whole new lifestyle. I can no longer ""treat myself"" if I'm having a bad day - I have to consider, will spending all that money really fix my problem? Is it worth losing $20 just to make myself ""feel better"", or is that just some sort of shallow dream that I can overcome? I find myself saving on so many things I used to fearlessly indulge in.

It really is so amazing to take a step back and have the opportunity to show myself what a spoiled person I was. I don't think (or I guess, I don't hope) that I'm a rotten person, nor do I think I'm particularly ignorant about money. But this experience has just taught me so much about my own lifestyle, and my money managing habits. Although it's super stressful for me to have to pick and choose what's worth my money, it has also been incredibly liberating. I don't quite understand why a restriction of money makes me feel liberated, but it really does. It makes me want to change myself. It makes me cherish what I buy, it forces me to thoroughly think through a purchase, and (most of all), it really makes me appreciate each and every single person who works their ass off at any job anywhere just to earn a little bit of green. I hope that someday I'll be able to go back to that comfortable spending lifestyle, only with money that I've earned by my own hands."

Of course, I’ve gained some new insights and perspectives in life, made new friends and memories, have more connections and experiences and have enjoyed the freedom of new life in college and eventually I will have a bachelor’s degree from a prestigious university, yet I feel that the money isn’t worth enough in terms of what and how much I gain out of this.

I did more work than just about anyone on exec. But I didn't fit in with the rest of the board. Even though I had been elected by the entire club, who  knew I was dedicated to the group, the exec found a way to kick me off simply because I did not fit in with them perfectly. I understand that there needs to be accountability in student groups, and sometimes exec members do need to be kicked off. But to do so because someone isn't your favorite person, rather than because of their work ethic, is simply wrong. Yes this happens in the real world. I'm glad I'm prepared for it. But WashU certainly should be better. And to those who make WashU a cliquey, gossipy place that is unaccepting of different personalities, shame on you."

I remember the consent workshops in orientation and stuff and always being told that you can't consent if you're intoxicated--but does anyone seriously believe this? If this is true then if I get drunk with a guy (or girl) and have sex with them, then we raped each other. See how this doesn't make sense? We need to have more nuance in how we discuss alcohol, sex, and consent."

I need your advice. I have been talking to a guy from a lower socioeconomic class and it seems that although he is affectionate, he is oblivious to how offensive he can be.  He makes statements about me coming from a rich background because I went to a private school (not true at all), going to see a counselor (why go ask someone to tell you what to do as a grown adult), and being tolerant towards others who are different.

1550,2015-02-12 19:24:45,"The other day I had the unexpected honor of being kicked out of an exec board of a cultural student group. And do you want to know the worst part about being kicked out of a group? It's being kicked out and no one having the decency to tell you this to your face. I didn't find out I was kicked out of the group until I contacted the exec president after I noticed that I was removed from both the exec Facebook chat group and the Facebook exec page.

Now you may ask yourself- what could I possibly have done to deserve this? Surely, such swift and complete action would only be warranted by some sort of grievous transgression on my part. You would think that, right? But no. I didn't do anything wrong. In fact I did a lot of stuff right. When we had events who was almost always there? I was. When we had the activity fair last fall who was the person who set up the table and chairs? It was me. And when I couldn't be there it was for a darn good reason. Like I had a class. You know, the things we're supposed to go to so we get an education?

When I contacted the president to ask what was going on the only thing she could say was that she was sorry. Some members felt that I ""wasn't contributing as significantly as they were"". Which is sort of funny since one member of the exec board (who's still there by the way) was studying abroad last semester. So I know that at least last semester I was contributing a heck of a lot more than he was. And yet I'm still the one to get axed. I knew when I spoke with the president that her explanation was groundless. The truth is actually quite simple. I didn't fit in and so the other members decided they didn't want me anymore. You see most of the other members of my former exec board are pretty extroverted. I, on the other hand, tend to be rather quiet. I'm betting that they decided that I wasn't as ""fun"" of an exec member as they wanted so they got rid of me to make room for their friends or for people ""like them"" to join. There is also the possibility that my race may have something to do with it. It hasn't escaped my notice that the only person kicked out of the group is also the only person of a different race than any of the other exec members.

Now, you may wonder why am I even bothering with this post. I should just move on and let this go. In the real world people get fired or kicked out of groups or excluded for all sorts of petty reasons. Why am I making such a big deal out of it? The answer to that is simple: I'm tired. In the several (i.e. more than 4) years that I've been a Wash U student I've witnessed case after case of favoritism play out in various student groups and in various performances. I've seen and been one of the more than qualified students who has been passed over for a spot or a position so that a friend of an exec member or choreographer or interviewer can get the position. I just can't be quiet about it anymore. The nepotism has got to stop people! I know that this sort of stuff goes on in the real world. And I should be prepared for it. But I guess I just hoped that Wash U would be a fairer place than that. It should be a fairer place than that. And if it's not then there should be somewhere where we can address this issue. I'm writing this here because I know of no place else to go where I feel like complaints against student groups will be heard. If you guys know someone that I could contact, please comment that below.

The last words that I heard from my ex exec board president were that she's ""sorry"". Well, I think she should be. I know I am."

It's really made me question if I ever will.

When there's a lull in my hectic schedule, the thought kind of eats at me. It'd be nice to have someone to go on dates, experience and share moments in life, go on hikes and jogs through the park, try new foods, have late night talks, and cuddle with. Having someone understand and know who you are on an intimate level, not necessarily physical, is a beautiful thing, and I feel like I'm missing out on that aspect of life.

I've been on my fair share of dates and tried to make it work but to no avail. You'd think after being in a graduating class of 730 people in high school and being away at college and in grad school for going on 5 years now I would've met at least one person...

Actually, since a few people have been asking today about my identity/when I'll graduate, this is probably a good time to mention that I'll likely be stepping down as admin in the future. Not in the immediate future, but sometime down the road before I graduate. 

I love running this page, but the truth is, it can be extremely mentally tolling. Being the admin means I have to meet a lot of contradicting demands from students and student groups across the campus, so I wind up having to pay a price for every decision I make. It also means I have to take blame if someone gets offended by a confession - I've realized that it's easy for people to shift misdirected anger onto an anonymous administrator. 

Aside from that, reading depressing confessions almost every day can be tough. Hell, I lost sleep the other night when I got an actual suicide note as a confession and couldn't do anything about it. (I actually tried, but the truth is, I really had no idea who it came from or how to help them)

Point is, I love running this page and the community that it has built, but I'll likely be stepping down in the future so I can concentrate on my life as regular student. At the very least, I'll be taking a short break in the near future - just for a few days. It'll be a nice chance to get better perspective on my non-admin life anyway! :)

-Admin

1568,2015-02-11 21:05:26,"My girlfriend broke up with me last year on Valentine's Day, after I took her out for brunch and bought her flowers. Seriously who does that?"
1569,2015-02-11 21:43:28,All i want on Valentines Day is to go on a date with WashU Confession's admin :'(
1570,2015-02-11 20:54:29,"I really wish all of the energy that goes into hatred and criticisms on this campus went to love and support of one another. The fact that we are all intelligent enough to have differing opinions is so amazing, but why not use it to enact positive change? I confess that it hurts when people belittle what I am passionate about. I try my absolute best to be accepting of everyone's opinions, to listen to my friends go on and on about the things they are passionate about even though I don't really care about the subject or agree with them, and I honestly wish they would do the same for me. For anyone reading this post, even though sometimes you may think you're being funny by making light of what someone cares about, even though you think the person doesn't care because they always just smile and play along, they may actually care. And it may actually really weigh down on them that the people they love make less of what they trully care about. For a person that wants to dedicate their life to something, and that tries to do their best to be the best person possible, it really hurts when their friends make light of it. So I guess the reason I posted this is just to urge everyone to think before your speak, and just be respectful at all times. Many of us are taught the golden rule of ""treat others the way you would like to be treated"" during infancy, but I guess it's just one of those things you forget over time."
1571,2015-02-11 18:42:32,"So now we know the admin is not only respectful and articulate, he also just bought a ukulele so he's musical and quirky. My crush on an anonymous webpage moderator continues to grow."

1576,2015-02-11 00:07:40,"I confess that I'm openly gay but not out-there-in-your-face gay. I really want to pursue relationships with guys (all kinds: hookups to dating) but I don't know how to meet people or let people know I'm interested in guys without being uncomfortable and making a big deal of my sexuality. Also, it's hella hard to meet guys on this campus who 1. are gay 2. are attractive 3. are attracted to me. I see gay couples together on social media and around campus all the time, and I see guys hooking up at parties, but I have no clue how that stuff initialized. Help a brother out?"
1577,2015-02-11 00:19:41,"I confess that I am currently dating an amazing guy, but I miss being single so much. I loved going on dates and meeting new people and the excitement of it all. Is there something wrong with me? Everyone says that having a bf is what they all want and yet I think I don't want one..."
1578,2015-02-10 22:11:42,"This is a two-part confession, so hang with me here.

I first confess that I'm sick and tired of people using Confessions as a political mouthpiece. Lord knows I have biases, but look--even if I agree with a post, I think it's unethical to use Confessions in this way.

When you submit a confession, it's going to reach a far broader audience than you could ever hope to reach using your own Facebook page. Using Confessions is leveraging that greater reach to score political points. What's more, you're protected from the consequences of your opinion. But, you say, isn't that the point of a Confessions page? That one can feel free to speak one's mind? Well, yes. But posting nakedly political content anonymously is, frankly, cowardly. An essential part of political discourse is the willingness to stand behind one's opinions and to defend them. Every time something controversial happens on or around campus--most recently, Black Anthology--I see a rash of ""confessions"" (scare quotes absolutely intended) from people apparently unwilling to take a public stand behind their criticism or rhetoric. That's gross. It lowers the quality of discourse. It distracts from what I see as the true goal of this page, which is to be a safe space for /personal/ confessions. Wash U Confessions shouldn't be your damn soapbox.

Now, given the rant above, it would be hypocritical to stop here. So my second confession: On MLK day, I went to the library to study around 6 in the evening, having forgotten it was closed. I had just walked into the lobby when I saw a girl leaving the library proper. (I don't know who she was--probably an employee.) On an impulse, I walked toward her, and she held the door for me, and I was in. And a quick tour revealed I had the library all to myself.

My second confession is that, for several hours between 6 and 11ish--when I knew the custodial staff would arrive--I got hella naked in the library, and nobody found me, and it was great.
Thanks for reading."

From theorizing about a world where pies are baked into cakes to sharing bad cantaloupe puns and words of encouragement, my trip to Eads is always enlightening.

Guys, you're missing out."

1584,2015-02-10 10:39:53,"I don't want to make this an anti-ungulate post or generalize here, but I have to say that I've come to realize that there is a significant percentage of ungulates who are pigs. Three situations happened in the last week alone.

First, I was walking past a farm when an ungulate came to the fence. The animal then started to squeal and oink at me, it was offensive to be objectified and harassed like that. Turns out it was a fucking pig. Luckily I found out it was a pig in the nick of time before I committed to anything.

Second, at that same farm, I saw this beautiful horse standing in a meadow. The graceful animal then wandered over to a water/mud hole and began rolling around like a fucking pig -> further proof that ungulates are pigs!

Then, another time my friend saw this bull fornicating  with a cow in the field, and then the very same day it was committing the same sin (before marriage no less), with a completely different cow. What a fucking PIG!

Thank god me and my friends were able to realize what these animals were before anything more serious happened or we got hurt. But all of these creatures acting like animals, chasing physical pleasure though at what cost. I have some serious trust issues now, everything looks like a pig to me."

I love my parents, I like the area where I grew up, and I have great friends from back home... but if I'm being completely honest, all I miss is my dog.  Like I've only cried once this semester and it was when my sister emailed me a picture of my dog.  I'm not sure if this is a good thing, or a really really troubling emotional state.  Advice/condolences welcome"
1587,2015-02-10 00:11:57,"No matter how we feel about the views presented in Black Anthology, can we take a moment to appreciate the boss ass music in it? I just wanna thank BA for introducing me to jams like Glory and Black Rage. Thanks so much for bringing a new genre into my life."
1588,2015-02-10 00:27:58,"I'm a black person closely affiliated with BA, and I just want to honestly say that the last 48 hours have blown my mind. The show wasn't inclusive. Point blank. But it wasn't really meant to be inclusive, it was meant to showcase stories that students on our campus and around the nation have experienced. I can understand where your sense of discomfort is coming from, I identify with Sydney's desire to know more about the shooting of a person before giving my support. But the responses on YikYak (be they trolls or otherwise) were completely unwarranted and have made me feel unwelcome in an already polarizing society.

To those who complained that BA painted an unfair picture of white people. It did, and that needs to be addressed, but saying that blacks are only here because of affirmative action instead of intelligence only lends credence to the fact racism, bigotry and prejudice is alive and well on WashU's campus. There are productive ways to hold dialogues about race, posting stupid Yaks and complaining anonymously are not one of those ways."
1589,2015-02-09 23:18:11,"I really hate dates.  They freak me out.  I know a lot of people use them as a way of finding out if they want to be in a relationship with a person.  But going on dates makes me feel like I should be super interesting and always have something witty to say.  At the end of the night I feel obligated to make out and or sleep with the person I'm with even if I don't particularly feel anything for them after spending 3 or so hours together.  Even when I do go out with a person I already like, I get super nervous and just want to leave."
1590,2015-02-09 23:08:12,"I don't want to make this an anti-male post or generalize here, but I have to say that I've come to realize there is a significant percentage of men who are pigs. Three situations happened in the past week alone.

First, a man I had been dating for the past few months (who I left because he was only interested in sex) tried to fool my best friend into falling for him without telling her who he was when HE KNEW she was my best friend. Luckily I found out in the nick of time.

Second, another man who I have been dating, tried to ask out another one of my best friends. This one however didn't know me and her were close. When she informed him of his mistake, he says, ""Oh well, I'm talking to you now."" The way he objectified her to her face is disgusting. Just because I wasn't his girlfriend doesn't mean he can disrespect the loyalty two female friends have to each other.

Finally, the last man who I personally know has a girlfriend and a child to take care of, started telling my friend how beautiful she was and how he wanted to go out with her (conveniently not mentioning his home situation). The most disturbing thing about all of this is, the deceit; and I'm not saying that women don't do this too (they do!) but if my girlfriends and I hadn't been a little more clever than usual and sharing our stories, we all would have been played and so many people could have gotten hurt. All for what, physical pleasure? I now have serious trust issues."
1591,2015-02-09 22:42:14,Y'ALL LET'S HAVE A SINGLES PARTY AT CHEESEOLOGY ON VALENTINES DAY
1592,2015-02-09 22:56:15,"I saw the Wash U Confessions post about Cheeseology closing and how kind they are as employers, and inspired, me and my friends went to eat there. We showed them the Confessions post, and it made them so happy to know that we cared. I left them a 100% tip, with the hashtag #GiveCheeseGiveBack. I'm only posting this on here because I really, really want this to become a thing. Let's come together and show this business that we appreciate all that they've done for us!!"
1593,2015-02-09 20:25:20,"To the people tipping generously at Cheeseology - thank you from the bottom of my heart. This news was unexpected and I and especially my coworkers have had a rough few days and have some difficult decisions to make, but the support some of y'all have shown has been amazing. It helps us out financially as we get ready for the struggle of finding new work in a tough job market, but more than that it just means a lot to us personally to know there's a whole community supporting us when we need it most. THANK YOU. #GiveCheeseGiveBack"
1594,2015-02-09 20:16:21,"There's this very attractive girl that I see walking around a lot and have exchanged smiles with, and I really want to go up and introduce myself. I just don't know how to do this without being creepy."
1595,2015-02-09 20:06:22,"To all those people getting offers: congrats on your achievements, and I as your friend am happy for you. But just please be mindful of all those people who are still anxiously waiting for offers. It's really okay to post if you have gotten in your dream program and we'd love to know where you are going post-graduation but posting every single offer you've gotten seems too much."
1596,2015-02-09 18:08:24,"People are like trains. They are hard to buy unless you are very wealthy, do not survive long if you put them underwater, and make loud noises when they come.

Sorry, had to get that off my chest."
1597,2015-02-09 15:20:25,"Today I saw that cheese-ology announced they're closing on March 7. I used to work for them, and I'm so deeply disappointed by this news. Chef Bill is one of the most socially-conscious employers I've had, offering fair wages and going to great lengths to avoid cutting hours for myself and about a dozen amazing former coworkers, several of whom have families to support. Cheese-ology has also done a number of benefit nights for student groups here on campus, generously giving back to our community. I know there's been a lot of discussion on here as of late regarding tipping and the reputation of WashU students on the loop. If you want to make a genuine difference and give back to a local small business, stop by Cheese-ology before they close. Be polite, tip well, etc etc - but mostly let the staff know they've been appreciated. It's heartbreaking to see a company that has worked so hard to give so much to other people have to close, but I hope they go out with a bang."
1598,2015-02-09 15:13:26,"There's a girl I like, and I would love to write a Wash U Admirer's post about her, but I'm scared she'll recognize who I am and it would be very embarrassing."

My friends (in a not so friendly manner) blame me for having impossible standards.  Is it really so unreasonable to want to wait for someone I click with?"
1600,2015-02-09 13:13:29,"Hi there, so I'm that one white girl in the show (second year running now), and first of all, thank you for commenting--dialogue is exactly what the show is looking for. I think your reaction is in some ways understandable; I personally felt a little uncomfortable at times in preparation for the show. However, I think we have to remember that the show was not performed to target a particular sector of the audience and make them feel either good or bad, insult or uplift them. Instead, it was performed to represent a real, felt experience of black students on this campus; it was performed to make the entire audience think; and it was performed to bear witness to an incredible amount of pain that is part of that experience, especially this year. It wasn't intended to make us feel united--quite the opposite in fact--it was intended to make us reconsider and question just what our definition of ""united"" is today. And as for alienation, it's not always such a bad thing. I've felt it to an extent, and what it does is allow me to see exactly where I stand--and then decide where I want to stand."
1601,2015-02-09 13:58:32,"Black people are (mostly) terrible about explaining white privilege to white people. It's really not a difficult concept, but no white person is going to accept it if they feel like they're being attacked. I'm white, I get easy treatment from police all the time. I've been caught with drugs before by police and I've been let off with warnings. It was explained to me thusly: white privilege is the stuff that you DON'T have to worry about as a white person. Are the police/store owners/etc. watching me? Will I be pulled over because I'm black and driving a nice-ish car? Will the job I'm interviewing for not hire me because of a particular hair style? Will people think I've only gotten into this university because I'm black? Will people just assume I'm less qualified to be here because of affirmative action? This is shit that I, as a white person, have never had to worry about. Ever."

Part 1.  I confess that I actually do want to see.  Curiosity can go ahead and kill me.

Part 2.  If someone wanted to set up a protest where actual members of the kink community lead BDSM sessions during and or right after showings of the film, I'd be all about that"
1603,2015-02-09 13:50:35,"I am the one of people behind the #ClaimYourBigotry/YikYak campaign. I’d like to preface this by saying no student group, ESPECIALLY NOT the Association of Black Students and Black Anthology, had anything to do with the YikYak Flyering today. It was a group of us who were upset with the lack of acknowledgment of the visible, verbal and blatant racism on this campus. We were extremely offended by these yaks that address Ferguson, BA and other recent events. Our intention was not to cause anxiety but you should feel uncomfortable about these posts because they reflect the thoughts and the feelings of your peers. We have been uncomfortable since we stepped through the Brookings Arch. You are using your privilege of anonymity to intentionally hurt other specific people.

THIS IS NOT A REPRESENTATION OF THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS OF THE ENTIRE BLACK COMMUNITY. We are one section of it. This is our opinion. We are hurt and this is our expression. Just as the people that posted those yaks wanted their freedom of expression this is ours. We are not sorry."
1604,2015-02-09 13:38:37,"As a white student, I saw BA and loved it. It made me think hard about a lot of issues and the only thing I felt bad about after seeing it was how passive I've been in wake of Ferguson and other similar tragedies. I didn't feel bad for being white, or singled out, or anything else these confessions have been talking about. I was mostly amazed at the talent of the students involved and thoughtful about how I can be supportive for a group of people who have been discriminated against and marginalized for so long."
1605,2015-02-09 13:30:38,"As a black student, I just want to say that BA also made me uncomfortable; Not because BA, the show, was uncomfortable, but because I felt like it was a pretty telling representation of universities across the nation just like WashU and it scared me. Its so hard to take everything that's happened and put all of it into perspective at once and BA did that, it made me scared to be on this campus and realize that while I am a part of this WashU community, it's very possible that if I didn't wear a backpack around campus, people would heavily doubt that I go here.

Of course I related to the feelings of ""otherness"" on this campus, but I mostly connected the sometimes sudden transformation of  ""otherness"" to marginalizaiton (when things like Michael Brown's shooting occur).

Sometimes when people get comfortable, they overlook what's right in front of them. People sometimes overlook that I am black (and that I don't want to be judged for it) but I want you to acknowledge that is a part of me. People overlook our Muslim students and how the attacks in France may have effected them. People throw around jokes about rape and sexual abuse all the time, and we've become desensitized to the needs of others for the sake of fitting in and being comfortable.

I came to WashU because I loved the people here; but I've been upset on countless occasions when the people I call my friends choose to challenge themselves by starting a new television show they were hesitant about, but don't want to talk about race, or sex, or things that may make them uncomfortable.

I'm uncomfortable for a good chunk of my time here, and as weird as this sounds, It would feel a little better if we, as a community were a bit uncomfortable together at events like BA or the Vagina Monologues, so I went and I listened, and I learned. And even if BA isn't your thing, I would just hope people would try to learn as rigorously as they do in their classes or extracurriculars (or even 1/100 of that) when it comes to things that effect our WashU community, even if its just 6% of it."
1606,2015-02-09 02:55:40,"I first want to say that I did not see Black Anthology, and therefore cannot comment on exactly what was said as part of the play, only what I have heard about it from friends who went and posts on anonymous pages such as this one.  However, as is obvious by such posts, there are a number of white students who felt offended and/or alienated by the way they were portrayed.  The argument has been made, in an effort to justify this sentiment, that African American students often feel isolated as well.

Wouldn't it be better to make an effort to reduce the isolation felt by African American students rather than to justify the alienation of students from other backgrounds as well?  Yes, talking about racism and prejudice can be uncomfortable, and yes, the dialogue needs to happen.  But an eye for an eye isn't going to work here.  Can't we improve the situation of one group of students without putting down another?"
1607,2015-02-09 02:10:41,"As a white student who watched BA: The Six, I admit I felt very uncomfortable.  I felt almost as if it wasn't meant to educate on the issues but rather place blame for them.  I understand that this is a very big issue throughout the entire country, but I don't agree that it should be labeled by ""White cops killing black kids.""  In all honestly, is it any worse that white cops were involved as opposed to a non-white cop?  Think about it.  Is it really racial prejudice because the cops are white and the victims are black or is it simply because the victims are black?

I grew up near STL in a town literally 99% white.  All my life, even still from coworkers of all races, I am told of the dangers of STL, of downtown, and of North County in particular.  My entire life I have been warned never to even step foot in some of these areas because of the likelihood of becoming a victim of crime (STL is always ranked at the top of crime per capita studies). You might think that this mindset is stereotyping and unjust but in the past year alone, multiple people I've met through school and sports have been shot and killed by black kids. So I ask anyone to explain to me, when you grow up in a town where hundreds of thousands of people of all races agree that its best not to let your guard down in a place like Ferguson, that an ordinary police officer (of any race) wouldn't be overly cautious of someone who appears to be a potential danger to them?  It shouldn't matter if the cop was white or black, or if the victim was white or black, when you are in a notoriously dangerous area and you have to be authoritative over people who do not respect you, you need to be prepared for the worst and sometimes the worst case scenario becomes reality.

Also, when I heard the line ""No child should have to grow up in fear of making it to adulthood"" (or something along those lines), I felt that it was misguided.  I felt that they were expressing that only black children live in fear when in reality, everyone does and for different reasons.  I'm not saying its justified to for black children to get killed because white children get killed by them, I'm just trying to explain that this city has always been divided and that everyone in this city fears for their life.  We live in a violent world and there are violent people who will continue to kill and murder.  Trying to turn it into a race war isn't going to fix anything.  In fact, using race at all prevents unison.  How can we claim to all be equal and live in unison if we are always trying to group ourselves as white, black, Hispanic, etc.?  The real problem should be police oppression.  When you stand up and say ""We as Americans have a problem with police oppression""  I'll stand up with you, but when you say ""Us minorities have a problem with police oppression""  I don't feel like it involves me, nor like I'm welcomed to be a part of the cause.  And before anyone tries to claim that white people don't get discriminated upon by the police, try growing up in a town where there is no racial divide.  I grew up in a county where meth and heroin are used like candy.  The police will always find ways to discriminate, its like its their job, and I myself have been discriminated and oppressed by officers simply because of what I was wearing, who I was with, or what time of the night I was out at multiple times."
1608,2015-02-09 02:30:42,"Chancellor sees a few posts on Confessions and Yik Yak using factual evidence to contest the riots and protests in favor of Michael Brown and he sends out a mass email calling the student body racists!

But when he sits down and watches a specific group of skin colored people spend school money on a production and make an atrocious public comment on another group of skin colored people, he says nothing."
1609,2015-02-08 23:34:43,"I wasn't able to see Black Anthology, but I have heard various accounts of it. Can someone provide a brief summary of what was said that is sparking so much debate? I don't want my perspective of it to be misguided from rumors and such. Much appreciated!"
1610,2015-02-08 23:24:45,"I personally know quite a few white students that were offended by the line in Black Anthology. It didn't make us feel united, it made us feel alienated for a physical attribute and to be honest, considering we were all sitting in the theater and participating, none of us were responsible for discriminating against blacks.... therefore we were insulted for no reason."
1611,2015-02-08 23:09:48,"While I did like Black Anthology's message that black people also come from all walks of life and are very diverse as a race, I did not appreciate the message that was sent when the character Jordan silenced another girl when she said she wanted to get all of the information before coming to a conclusion. Saying stuff like, ""All the information you need to take this photo is that a white officer shot an unarmed black teenager and that is never ok"" only breeds more hostility. If you're asking people to listen to you and what you have to say, you should be able to do the same and consider the possibility that you may not be 100% correct in your views. Yes minorities are still discriminated against, and there are still many cases of wrongful death, but by stereotyping and generalizing the police force as faceless uniforms is committing the same transgressions that you say are being held against you. Police officers are people too, with lives and families and stories. I understand that this cause is important, but maybe the faces of the cause should be cases where there is no argument, like when it is caught on camera, instead of cases where all we have to go off of are faulty eyewitness reports and inconclusive evidence. Listen to somebody's story before making a judgement, for listening leads to questioning, questioning leads to understanding, and understanding leads to change."
1612,2015-02-08 23:57:49,"""The Six"" by Black Anthology was not meant to be racist or offensive, but if a large group of people take offense, then those feelings should be addressed, regardless of who the feeling is coming from. Downplaying the discrimination people experience is the reason why systematic racism and prejudice still exists. I am not speaking on behalf of anyone, I am just one person who is trying to make sure I understand where both sides are coming from, and I think everyone should. So post your  confessions, let your grievances be heard- what EXACTLY in the play hurt or offended you? In which ways did BA portray white people as racists? What does racism men to you? Which parts of the play felt like a personal attack? Time and time again we have said that this or that may not be the ""ideal"" place to discuss this but I honestly think it should be wherever you feel comfortable speaking, or like your voice will be heard.

However, there is a fallacy in the system; a type of minimism ideology that only seems to be applied to the size of the cereal bowls and chili containers. I hope to find the answer to the most burning question I can think of: Why are they so small? WHY?! My stomach is left wanting more after one cereal bowl than I've ever wanted in my 19 years of existence. If only my meal plan could fund the endless chili pots and cereal bowls my appetite yearns for. Please bd, make the bowls bigger. Stop the madness. Introduce a bottomless chili wednesday perhaps? I don't know, but do something. Empty stomachs have caused many populations to do horrible things in the past. I.e. Communism.

No one blames you for their actions, we blame you for your own actions: the ignorant statements, judgments, and rudeness. If you didn't act like your prejudice forefathers to minorities, then much of what we feel would be no longer present. Think about the things you do, and stop trying to stop the dialogue by saying we blame you for the actions of your ancestors.

1617,2015-02-08 18:00:57,"I find it funny how people can only point out the negatives they encounter with talks about race. There was literally three days dedicated to Race & Ethinicity dialogue. Some of our top professors and student leaders attended and spoke about race & ethnicity not only in America but at Washington Universit as well. I sat next to chancellor wrighton and spoke to him about my own experiences as a black low income student at Wash U and heard his insights as well. As a delegate it is my responsibility to not only inform you that you can easily go to voices.wustl to access the three day experience but you can also take part in the experience by blogging or tweeting. If you REALLY want to know how people feel or understand that racism is still Rampant in America (maybe not blatant but it is still here) then go watch what your peers had to say. No one wants you to ""feel bad"" as a white student rather we want you to be aware of your privileges and our oppression. No one is trying to demonize you either. You'll see that once you watch the videos.. And please Don't tell me you don't have time to watch the videos but you have time to be on fb, snapchat, yik yak, Instagram etc. etc. if you really want to gain a better understanding (you don't even have to agree) then go access the footage and maybe you'll be more enlightened. :)  toddles . Enjoy the weather!"
1618,2015-02-08 15:04:58,"So, I'm going to have to preface this confession with the admission that I did not go to Black Anthology. It sounded plenty interesting, but I had other commitments and couldn't make it... That said, none of what I'm about to say applies specifically to BA because I can't speak for it--all I know about it is from a couple of friends and YikYak.

However, I do feel that the little bit of arguing on YikYak prompted me to start thinking about the whole race issue, and I have words that I need to say about it.

Firstly, I do believe racism is still rampant in America, and I do believe that there are many situations in which blacks are mistreated because of unfounded stereotypes surrounding their race--however true or false these may be. Each person, regardless of their skin color, is exactly that: a person. Our actions should speak for who we are rather than our race. Not every black person is a thug, not every white person is a racist, not every Asian is a massive nerd, etc, etc. I could go on forever with that, but you get the point. Only those who act like thugs or act like racists are thugs and racists. The continued existence of these attitudes indicates, in my opinion at least, some undercurrent problem that plagues our country.

For the current moment, the overarching opinion is that the system, and in general the population, harbors innate racist tendencies. I'm not going to try to prove whether this is or isn't true--perhaps that is why we need to have dialogues and such, to figure out if racism is really the crux of the matter or if there is an even more fundamental, insidious issue that is causing this strife. I'm willing to listen to this dialogue, so long as it remains civil and, for lack of a better word, ""intelligent"" (that is, without devolving into a series of strawmen, ad hominem, and otherwise fallacious and unsupported arguments that rely on emotion rather than reason).

That said, however, I don't feel as though this kind of dialogue is what is happening. As a white male, I don't see any dialogue--at least, not any that is directed toward me and my people. For us, it's attacks and satire to point out the sins of ours forefathers, for which we now are apparently guilty--not as an individual, but as a whole, and it is this reasoning that completely defeats social equality before it really even ever has a chance to take off. I know my sins, as do many whites, but to sit there and pick them apart for us is not helpful. If anything, it pushes many of us away because, while our misdeeds are paraded for all to see, the faults of the minority communities are brushed under the rug. We're almost all guilty to some degree for preventing equality, whether it be for the direct mistreatment of others of others or for alienating those who need addressing. Just fixing the white folks' attitudes is not going to fix racism--it's got to be everyone. Yet, I don't see that... I legitimately feel that we are the target here. If there is a demand racial sensitivity for one group, there needs to be the same for all--including whites. Minorities are no better than us, and we are no better than minorities.

Now, of course, I've seen some people justify this by saying that this is the same pain that minorities, especially blacks, have felt in America for a long time, that it is justified because of the blood that stains others' hands. Yet, in my experience, this hasn't really ever done much to encourage many others to take up arms against racism and inequality. Perhaps it is my naivety speaking, but can't only light drive out darkness, or love drive out hate? It seems that too many people have forgotten MLK already. Exacting revenge isn't going to fix anything. If you fight fire with fire, then we will all burn.

I know I may have not perfectly described what I wanted to here, but it's any issue that I feel needs to be addressed. There's a lot of people, both that I know and that I don't, who have there heart in the right place, but to me, it seems that many of those fighting for equality--both minority and majority--have taken a route that *could* fix the issue, though at such a cost that I wonder who at all would benefit. We're all people. Why can't we act like it?"

This isn't a confession I just thought you should know.

======

Thing is, that isn't true. I haven't received any confessions about Black Anthology, and if there's something honest that needs to be said about it, I WANT it to be said (as long as it's respectful). 

But I also hope you understand that when people use Wash U Confessions to talk about delicate issues like this, this page takes heat from students and student groups. In those situations, I'll face consequences no matter what I do. If I give people a voice, I’ll also have to take blame for what they say, and if I don’t, I take blame for “silencing them”.  

Either way, I don't mind posting something honest and controversial if it opens up discussion. Being a scapegoat for misdirected anger really gets tiring after a while, but I realize it's part of the job.

1625,2015-02-07 18:15:22,"I hate the green cup. Every year, comments about how you're fat if you take the elevator or the circ or pretty much anything that's not ""green"" get made. Posters near the elevators and stairs always get defaced with some kind of anti fat comment. The one in my dorm was changed from ""Take the stairs if you care"" to ""Take the stairs if you fat"", and for some reason, my roommate felt the reason to not only point this change out to me but to also say ""I love it."" It's in plain view for everyone to see, and has been for most of the week; RAs take down inappropriate drawings, but no one has done anything about comments like this.

Last year during the green cup, I regularly broke down crying in my room because one person always made a point to tell me that I should take the stairs, and it got to the point that it became obvious that they were giving me passive-aggressive ""advice"" to improve my health.

Yik Yak regularly has anti-fat posts that are both objectifying and demeaning.

I regularly see and hear people literally rejoicing in the fact that there are barely any fat people on this campus.

I am fat. I admit it. I'm also working on it, for my own personal reasons. But the fact is that I feel like I don't belong here and my existence is being ridiculed expressly because I exist. My business is my own, and I shouldn't feel the need to justify my choices, actions, or existence."
1626,2015-02-07 17:39:24,"I've never been one to believe in love at first sight or anything like that. Until last year that is. At the end of last year I met this girl randomly at one of my friends' parties in his dorm room. I had never seen her before and the moment she walked in the door I was overwhelmed with her beauty. After a couple minutes of trying my hardest not to stare at her, I decided that I had to talk to her (a couple cups of liquid courage helped). Now normally I'm pretty good with talking to women, but that was not the case that night. I stumbled over words and frantically tried to find good questions to ask to keep the conversation going. Anything to keep the conversation going. But every time I thought of something, I would look into her eyes and the brain that got me into WashU would be reduced to a that of a puppy's when its owner comes back home. Eventually I was forced to play a game of beer pong and when I came back she'd already made her leave. The next day I tried to talk to her over FB to no avail.

I only see her in passing every once in a while since then, but whenever I do it makes my day as I awkwardly make eye contact and then proceeded to shyly smile at my shoes. Again, I'm not a shy person, but she takes my breath away, makes my heart race and every other lovey-dovey cliché I thought was foolish until now. And her worse offense? She's invaded my thoughts! She annexed my brain like Vladmir Putin and took no prisoners. She's a love war criminal and she doesn't even know it! Not that I'm mad or anything; quite the opposite actually. The meer thought of her cheers me up. I don't understand how this happened, and I don't know how this turned out to be such a  long confession. I just feel like I wanna tell this to the world and simultaneously keep this a secret ...so I did. Oh yeah she has a boyfriend btw. I guess my confession is that I'm scared that I'll never find someone who makes me feel this way again. And if I dont, will I feel like I settled for 2nd best and always think of the one that got away? Or maybe it's the one that was never in the lake in the first place? Idk. All I know is that I'm willing to wait until the cubs win the world series for this girl. If you read all of this then you the real MVP.

1627,2015-02-07 17:37:25,"Recently, I had an assignment and after finishing presenting it to our teacher in class, my teacher just didn't support our vision for the project and voiced that in a way that seemed harsh and offended me a little. I felt extremely embarrassed, as I would have in any class. But in this class, I am the only Black student. I became very anxious of what my white classmates thought of me. I felt belittled. I thought, ""I'm already excluded enough in this classroom, let alone this university, why single me out even more?"" I felt like it was an attack. Usually, I wouldn't have taken the feedback so personally but because of the atmosphere I felt like I was under heavy pressure. After class, I even went to BD. While I talked to one of the workers there (black female), I felt somewhat comfortable again but as soon as I walked through the rest of the dining hall and out of the door, I felt like I was suffocating again. I was suddenly aware of how few Blacks there are on this campus and wondered if everyone in the dining hall was judging me for my embarrassing failure (not even a failure, though) in class. I thought I would cry that entire time and I was willing myself not to until I got outside and put my hood on. But the second I got outside, I finally felt free. There was no one outside really and I was just me. Not a black student in a sea of white students.

I guess the point of me sharing this story is just to show that the lack of diversity here affects some minority students more than just by making them feel lonely. When you have anxiety, the lack of representation only adds to it. It makes it hard to be successful when you constantly feel like you need to prove yourself to people you don't even know just because there are less people who look like you. I'm not even sure if I described the feeling well enough because I have never felt so inadequate in my life. I don't think I could ever depict it in a way that would do it justice so I'll just stop here."

On another note, I tire of hearing people argue that tipping shouldn't exist and waiters should be paid more (great insight) as that is generally an excuse for not leaving a tip.

Sometimes I really don't want to freaking talk about weddings or whether or not I'm ready to start dating again or what I want to do for a career or how my shitty relationship with my parents is going (hint- it's probably still shitty) or about how I'm feeling that my grandma has cancer.

1645,2015-02-05 21:42:55,"I am an Asian who never experienced going to school or living in an area with people of the same race as me until college. My high school was primarily African American, Hispanic, and white. The only reason I ever felt uncomfortable was when I knew that my friends parents/grandparents were openly racist or that many people would never date me because of my race. Interestingly enough, those were not taboo topics. When I came to WashU my increase in comfort stemmed from people being much more accepting of other races than the place I came from. I guess I'm posting this to say that there is a different minority race in each different community and being around people of my own race makes no difference to me, the only thing that matters is being around people who are accepting and tolerant. I never feel uncomfortable if there are not people of the same race as me, but I do feel uncomfortable when people categorize my experiences,values, and worth based upon my race.

I have found that for me, race doesn't say as much about me as my future aspirations and personality do. For this reason, I surround myself with people who share similar aspirations and similar personalities rather than those of the same race.

I found that really interesting because I don't think white people feel that way.

I'm not trying to argue with the OP or invalidate his/her experiences or opinions. And I agree with the part about people with similar lifestyles tending to connect with each other easier, but I think for white people it's not a very strong connection. I don't look around at other white people here at school and feel some kind of shared connection with them just because of our skin color, and I'm pretty sure most white people feel the same way.

I don't want to start a comment war about race or unconscious biases or injustice or whatever else. I just think that race is just a smaller part of your identity for white people than for many other people. (And I know the reasons why, so no need to comment. But it still doesn't change the end result.)

The point is, your race or ethnicity may be really important to you (and that's great!) but most white people couldn't care less about ours. I'm sure it was important back when the Irish and Polish and the Italians were all living in separate neighborhoods and wouldn't intermarry and stuff, but nowadays like 99% of white people just don't care. And we generally don't care what yours is either. Be nice to me and I'll be nice to you!

Will I tend to gravitate to people with a similar lifestyle as me? Maybe. But to me that means people who enjoy the same hobbies or movies or music as me, people who are in my classes and extracurriculars, not people who look like me or were raised in the same socio-economic class. I think this is a major misunderstanding between races these days.

How about we all just try and hold on to some of that First-40 spirit and make friends all the time with anyone and everyone!

The attitude towards Wash U is SO bad that I've stopped admitting to new coworkers that I'm a member of the Wash U community, and the experience has made me tragically cynical towards my fellow students. Wash U kids are notorious for being difficult, and you can always count on them to tip for shit--if they tip at all.
But here's where it gets bad: when I try to make pleasant conversation with Wash U customers about us going to the same damn school, I'm typically met with bemusement and condescension, like they just can't believe that one of their own works in the service industry. I guess it just really sucks, because going to Wash U should be a source of pride. Not embarrassment."

You guys have the opportunity to connect with people who probably have similar lifestyles as you and if not that, can on some kind of level, surface or not, relate! Don't take this privilege for granted. I only wish there were more people of color here.. I wish I had more of an opportunity to see people who look like me...who (possibly) like what I like. I would also reach out to people who are different from myself in order to expand my understanding of those who may come from a different background. It's not fair but idk... Reach out to people who don't look like you sometimes. Have an open mind. Invite people in... Make people feel welcome.. Sometimes people may not feel like they are accepted.. Show them differently.

1657,2015-02-04 12:56:25,"In response to those complaining about WashU's decision to increase tuition to around $47,000 for the next academic year, I'm am truly sorry about the financial and mental stress that this decision is inflicting upon you and your family. However, I'd like to point out that this increase in tuition shouldn't come as a surprise to you as it is consistent with WashU's trend over the years of increasing tuition by around 3.5 - 3.8 percent annually. This is also consistent with the average annual 3.7 percent tuition increase across all private schools in the nation. Additionally, the average increase in base salaries in the US over the last 4 years was 2.8 %, so this increase in tuition is in part used to fund the roughly 2.8% salary increase to those employed by WashU. The almost 1% (not very high) average rate of inflation (decrease in real value of money) over the last year is another reason why tuition rates cannot be constant. The increased tuition will also be used to fund the increasing admissions of students who are eligible for Federal Pell Grants. (Under the assumption that WashU sticks to its goal of increasing economic diversity in the school.)

I myself come from a family that struggles to pay tuition at WashU, but we expected these annual tuition hikes before I committed to attend the school simply because it is a known trend across every private school in the nation. I planned for these annual increases and I'm surprised as to how this increase could come as a shock to someone. Additionally, in response to those who are seeking financial assistance, it is not very difficult to obtain low interest student loans. As a WashU student, you should be able to find a job after graduation that will help you pay off these loans assuming you worked hard and took advantage of the opportunities at WashU.  Personally, I worked my ass off and landed internships that paid me $14k and $18k my sophomore and junior summers respectively, and I am fortunate to have been offered a job that will be paying me $70K post graduation.

This post is in no way intended to offend or upset anyone, and is merely my opinion, and I hope it provides some insight to those who were surprised by, or  found the increase in tuition ""ridiculous"".  The contents of this post may not apply to everyone, and are not directed at those in extreme or special circumstances. Please speak out if you disagree with me or any of the arguments in this post, and I'd be happy to learn from your perspective. Lastly, I want everyone to know that If I can do it, so can you! I wish all the happiness, success and luck to all those affected by the increasing tuition at WashU."
1658,2015-02-04 01:05:26,I am going to have to go through an academic integrity procedure when I get back in the fall because of a misunderstanding last semester. I don't know what I am going to do if I get placed on probation or expelled. What if this ruins me and I can't get into graduate school or can't get a job or internship? I am so terrified that this is going to put an end to everything. I have never been suicidal before but fear I might be if the result is too awful. I'm so scared. I need comforting words.

1661,2015-02-03 18:55:32,"Hi- I don't know if this is exactly the kind of stuff you would post on here but I think this is really important for people to know about (and I would rather stay anonymous.) There is a free STI screening  in DUC 232 on Friday from 12-3pm for the first 70 students who show up. It's a great, free way to get tested so I really hope people know that this is out there."
1662,2015-02-03 17:49:34,"I get paranoid really easily, and maybe I'm just insecure,  but I've always been suspicious of one of my gf's guy friends. I believed her when she said nothing happened, but every time his name pops up or she gets a text from him, her attitude changes and she gets anxious, like in a bad way. And every time I ask what's wrong she says it's nothing, but it keeps happening. I just get the feeling she's hiding something that somehow affects our relationship now, even though it probably happened in the past or she no longer has control over it. Maybe I'm just imagining all the worst case scenarios, but I just wish she'd tell me. I know I don't have any right or anything to know, but I'm having a hard time trusting her right now, and I want to change that, and I want to be there for her."
1663,2015-02-03 01:07:35,"These tuition hikes are ridiculous. To help pay for school, I work two part-time jobs and use various outside scholarships that only cover a fraction of the cost. While WashU does cover quite a bit of the tuition, there is still a significant portion that my family has to scrounge up. This past year, my father had expensive cancer treatments  (which were not covered by insurance, as his insurance provider dropped him), and even though WashU has expressed their deepest sympathies for what my family is going through, they haven't been able to do a thing about the now 27K I owe the school. I honestly don't know how I'm going to afford my senior year."
1664,2015-02-02 21:07:37,"So my parents just got a letter from the school that the tuition for the school is 47 grand per year. I get financial aid which cuts away a significant portion of the tuition, but this is just way too much. Even a small increase in the tuition is staggering to my family. My parents are the only ones working in the family and they're supporting for my grandparents as well. My younger brother gave up the opportunity to go to a school of his choice because of tuition, and I'm living on a meal per day. I'm applying to every scholarship I can find, every tutoring, and also every student job, but it's just hard to balance all this with my studies. I'm trying hard to find a way to make it work, but I really don't know how."

I workout every day so that I can walk back to my off campus apartment alone and not be afraid of the people who stare, wink, whistle, follow, catcall, and tell me ""damn baby girl, I'd love to bite me off a piece of that"". I workout every day so that maybe I won't be a "" that"" or a ""thing"", but instead to be a me, she, her, a daughter, a sister, a friend. A human being. I workout everyday so that I can hold my head up high with pride at being a woman. I workout every day so that when I express my opinion, people won't side eye me, look me up and down, and then determine that "" I don't really know what I'm talking about"". I workout every day so that I can be met as an equal. I workout every day so that I don't have to shake and tremble as I write this, thinking about what I've gone through, and the worse things close friends of mine have endured because they too, are women. I workout every day to be safe. And, I workout every day to push back the fear and dread, knowing that even if I can someday become superwoman or a ninja or something else, something better, that will still not be enough. Because I am a woman."

When people ask my ethnicity I say Jewish and Italian.  Which usually leads to my explaining that religiously, I am Catholic.

I have been on many a date that were going well right up until I explain this to my date (who is Jewish)  at which point she goes from excited and having fun to clock watching and giving 1 word answers.  Like I can almost hear her mind going ""not Jewish, thanks for playing""

And that's fine!  Everyone has their deal breakers.

But it happened again recently (the whole date routine) and for the first time I am seriously considering attempting to disconnect from Jewish culture.  Just tell people I am Italian and Catholic, taking my mother's maiden name or take my future wife's.  Forsaking the Jewish last name I have carried my whole life feels weirder than anything else.  Like I am stabbing my family in the back.  But again why should I carry on a Jewish name when I am not Jewish?

I am really in the dark here and I have seen the Jewish community on here before offer some good insight to people with problems or questions.

I just want to hear some thoughts on this."

I expected something like this to happen to me sooner or later in St. Louis, so I prayed for another delicious burrito before I died and prepared to murmur the most neutral responses I could think of for the next ten minutes.

Then, he told me that he saved a young girl from getting crushed between the Metro doors once.

She was nine or so, and he pulled her in right when the doors were about to close on her arms.

Before he left, he told me his name was that of a Greek Hero's. ""'Because I did a lot of this on the street,"" he jokingly punched the air a couple times.

1688,2015-01-29 18:53:26,"Hey WashU! My name is Rishil and I’m the guy behind Hangout Fridays. A while back, in response to a lot of the confessions about people feeling isolated on campus, I decided to make my own post about this idea I had (see post here: bit.ly/WU2038). I figured people enjoy making new connections and people love board games/video games so I thought we could combine them. The goal was to bring our community together with a game night on Fridays so people could make new friends while having fun.

I never thought my little idea would get such a enthusiastic response. Newly inspired, my friends Aarthi, Brett and I got Ursa’s Night Life on board, and now, I’m proud to announce Hangout Fridays is going to become a reality!

The first event will be happening on Friday February 6th at 9PM at Ursa’s, and you can join the event here: http://bit.ly/HFKickoff. Come for the games, stay for the friends you’ll make. Be sure to join our group as well: http://bit.ly/HFGroup 


Frequently Asked Questions:


Will there be lots of food including pizza catered by Bon Appetit?
 - Good question! Indeed there will be!

Will there be Cards Against Humanity?
 - Heck Yeah!

Will there be a ton of board games?
 - Yes

Will there be Settlers of Catan?
 - You bet.

Is mayonnaise an instrument?
 - No, Patrick, mayonnaise is not an instrument.

Do you have a super secret surprise planned?
 - Oh yeah we do. It may or may not involve the projector screen and/or 8-player compatibility.


Bring a friend or two if you’d like, though that is certainly not required. If you liked the idea, be sure to spread the word! Have any suggestions or questions? Feel free to shoot me or any of the other team members a FB message!

Thanks for your support, WashU. I’m looking forward to making this an unforgettable event and the first of many."

However, it's still hard to see how easily everyone judged me then. When I look at my behavior from last year, I see someone on the path to self-destruction, and clearly exhibiting signs of it, but it doesn't seem like anyone (including my RA) was concerned about my actual health, and rather just wanted to look down on me. It hurts."

Both of his parents have cut him off and he doesn't know what he is going to do. He dropped out of school about a year ago for financial reasons, but he had been planning on transferring to somewhere in state. Now he's just lost. He told me he has no idea what he is going to do, and I honestly don't know what to say. The guy is one of my best friends and I have no idea how to help him.

I just heard that there was a silent protest on Friday for WashU students for Ferguson, and I had no idea about it until this morning (Wednesday). I'll admit that I complained a lot about the other protests, because I was mad that they were interrupting my study time, but I guess I understand why now. If people don't make noise and cause a scene, no one at WashU will care. We all just keep our heads down and mind our own business, and that's no way to create social change: its a way to stay comfortable and keep things how they are. To the protesters: I'm sorry I got so upset, and I'm sorry I made a mean yik yak post about you (even though I got a ton of up votes)"

Last semester I didn't have the greatest time and never really found any friends that I really viewed as ones I wanted to keep for the long term. I kept telling myself that everything would be different next semester once I was in a fraternity. It's not that I'm an antisocial or weird guy. I'm just very selective of the people I enjoy hanging out with and it takes a lot for me to truly connect with someone. I went to events for almost every fraternity on campus but never really fell in love with any of them or viewed them as guys I would want to be friends with for the rest of college. Still, I narrowed down to my three favorites and I tried my hardest to connect with as many brothers as I could but in the end I guess they didn't see me as a great fit. I'm not even upset about not getting bids but I'm just starting to worry that my niche at WashU just doesn't exist."

1705,2015-01-22 01:50:55,"Thursday night, I was quietly writing a paper in a study room on the second floor of Olin. My friend had just left to grab some food. A custodial staff member was making his rounds through the second floor, and entered the room I was in. I looked up, startled, and he assured me that he would be right on his way. The man noticed my binders sprawled over the desk, and casually asked me what I was studying.

“Oh, business,” I said. “Have a paper due tomorrow.”

The man then smiled, “You know, I just finished my classes!”

“Really?” I asked, caught somewhat off guard. “What in?”

“You see, I’m certified,” he beamed, and proceeded to pull a card out of his wallet.

Surprised, I took the card from the man. “Certified notary” it read. He proudly told me how he was getting on his feet, and even showed me his home office that he had just put together.
It took me a few moments  to think of anything to say other than ""Oh cool"" or ""Wow, congratulations"", but I managed to realize, “Oh yeah, you’re certified to sign off on important documents!”

The man seemed so incredibly excited, it actually made me a little sad inside. Here he was, putting in odd hours at the school at night, and was doing his best to get himself on his feet. As much as my interaction with him had already made my day, I told him that I really needed to get back to my paper. He understood, and started to walk out the door. Just before he left, he turned around.

“You know, one day, I just want to leave all this fucking shit behind, you know? Like roll this bin downstairs, and walk out, and never come back.”

Again at a loss for words, all I could manage was a gentle look of reassurance.

“God bless,” I offered, as he walked away.

Never before, I don’t think, had I truly understood what it meant to have been given such an opportunity to attend Washington University in St. Louis.

Thanks."

And I went with it. I have gone from relationship to relationship, which is great, but now that I'm single again I wanted to explore my options. I'm having a good time and have met some amazing people, yet I can't help but feel guilty. I know it probably sounds stupid, but I've never casually dated before and I'm really nervous about it."

Truth is, I feel really guilty that I can afford it and that my parents have to pay it, but I'm afraid I might be accused of taking someone else's opportunity if I try to get a job or scholarship to help pay for it.

Now I'm in one of the party sororities (who only took me because I'm a legacy) and I've never felt so out of place.  The girls are all prettier and cooler than me, and blatantly dismiss me or ignore me if I try to join a conversation.  I'm appalled by their focus on alcohol and how no one seems to want to hang out if it doesn't involve drinking.  I don't know what to do.

I've been looking into psychology therapy to mitigate the insane amount of anxiety I'm getting from realizing that I'll have to live with this disease for the rest of my life. My life could be cut shorter by several decades and I'll have to implement a new style to address my disease. I'm also getting prescription drugs to reduce the chances of me contracting this disease to others. I have no clue how to confront my parents about this. I was bewildered that an STD like HIV could easily be found on campus. On the other hand, I should've known better with all the education I've received on safe practices throughout my life. I'm a living, breathing warning of ""told-you-so"" and I'm still trying to come to terms with it.

It's frustrating to see all these posts on all kinds of websites and in TV shows and movies that the women are the one with the power over men. I know this is not how my life works. I just wonder if other people are in my position too. I have awesome friends, but I never date. I mean I don't know if I would want to date my guy friends, but not dating at all does not seem like the right thing either. I don't know how to not be friend zoned."

1735,2015-01-18 12:19:55,"I participated in sorority rush last year, but when nearly every sorority dropped me, I took myself out of the process. When bid day arrived, I felt sick in my bed hearing happy screaming down the halls from the girls who got in. I felt like I was less desirable than them, and it hurt so badly.

I told myself that I wouldn't rush again. The groups I clicked with didn't want me, so why would the next year be any better? I would suffer the same anxiety again, and for what? Maybe a repeat of this nightmare. I also couldn't bear the thought of crawling back to the same people who rejected me, it seemed pathetic. I was simultaneously terrified of reliving my experience, and so jealous of my friends, all of them it seemed, that found homes in their sororities.

Now, I'm a sophomore, and I didn't rush again. The few friends I have that had similar experiences to mine freshman year are rushing again, and their processes are going much better than before. They are optimistic that this time around, they will find a place that fits.

I thought that sticking to my gut instinct to not rush would help me move on from this fixation on my rejection, but I'm still just as torn up about rush this year as I was before. I can't help but wonder if my pride prevented me from moving on, or from being a part of something I still genuinely wish I were a part of."

I looked at that paper a lot. At first I had every intention to go, but I became increasingly anxious thinking about it. The day came and I was in the middle of some outing, bonding with the new people who were my floormates. I decided to stay with the floor.

Sometimes I think about emailing Open, or coming out to friends. My fear of opening up to new people or not receiving the support I need still overwhelms me. But I wanted to thank the person who handed me that paper slip. Even though I didn't do anything, I know I could have. I felt empowered then."

I just want to be free, I want to get rid of all the hate that fills my heart. I want to leave my religion and never look back, but most of all, I just want to be my own person.

1747,2015-01-14 19:17:25,"To dudes who are about to start rushing and worried about keeping friends:

My freshman year, my worst fear was that all my friends would get into fraternities, but I wouldn't, causing me to lose all my friends with whom I had worked so hard to form a relationship. Then, my worst fear was realized, but only the first half. Most of my friends got into a fraternity, but I did not. (There were others who did not, but they joined in following semesters.) Because of this, I spent a large portion of my freshman year in a terrible mental state, to the point of attempting suicide.

I realize now, and want to tell anyone in the same position, that just because your friends are all in fraternities and you are not, doesn't mean you will lose them as friends. Sure, you won't see them a lot (or even at all in some cases) during pledging, and it can be a bit of work to maintain friendships at the time, but in the long run, you'll stay close with your close friends. Now I'm a junior, and just about every single one of my male friends is in a fraternity. But I'm still very close with them, and actually made more friends through the fraternity. There are definitely times where it can get lonely, but I also have made a few fellow GDI friends with whom I also became very close.

My point is: it can seem awful at the time and like you'll lose friends, but you'll keep the ones who are very close. Plus, you could make even more friends out of it! Stick through this rough patch, because at the end of the semester, when they're done pledging, you'll see them just as much as you used to (perhaps more). Just keep your head up!"
1748,2015-01-13 21:13:26,"I keep wondering how student groups get away with racial discrimination.  One group, for example, explicitly says that it's open ""exclusively to queer or trans students of color"", in direct violation of university nondiscrimination policies.  Why is this kind of double standard allowed?  And why does my student activity fee go to groups that practice racial discrimination?  I was always taught that there is no acceptable form of discrimination, but the administration doesn't seem to realize that."

1751,2015-01-13 17:07:32,"Tonight at our floor meeting my floor did an activity where we wrote anonymous notes to each other. I expected to receive a few from the friends that I had made, but I was genuinely surprised by the outpouring of love I received from the people I live with. Sometimes I feel alone and friendless, like many of the people who post here, but feeling all this love tonight really touched me and made me feel so much better about everything.

To all those feeling down about life or their social situations, know that there are probably people who admire and love you but just don't express it.
And to all those secret admirers, know that an expression of your love will make someone's day and can have more of an impact than you can imagine."

1755,2015-01-13 00:18:38,"Does anyone remember a previous confession that explained how Greek “philanthropy” money never actually got donated—it just got reshuffled to support other sororities’ and fraternities’ philanthropy events? As I am participating in rush, I cannot seem to forget about this horrible truth. Or is it a truth? I have been asking around, and receiving varying responses. It's sad that I could not receive a straight answer from any one organization. I'm sure that each Greek organization has its own fair priorities and reasons for how its money is spent, but consider:..if this is truly how Greek philanthropies work, how are so many students content with being members of organizations whose alleged fundamental purpose of service goes unfulfilled? And in the most underhanded manner imaginable?"
1756,2015-01-12 20:35:40,"Most days, I really don't feel like I belong here.

I find myself getting cranky and angry when I hear about people going on vacation, or being able to go shopping whenever they want, or going out to fancy, expensive dinners. I come from a family that has always struggled with money and has never had the luxury to do so many of the things students here have done. I hate that 18 year olds who have never worked a day in their life get to go on extravagant European vacations when my 70 year old grandma, who is working so hard to the point where there are medical problems, has never even stepped foot outside the country.

I understand that privilege is not something people ask for, and if my parents could afford to send me on a vacation, I of course would take it. Despite that, I still am disgusted whenever I hear about anyone going on vacation. I hate when I hear that people ""bought"" something expensive, when I know that none of the money they bought it with was their own-- it was their parents, or inherited. How is it fair that I've had a job since I was 16, working 30 hours a week, while having to match the academic rigor of my peers who didn't have to be burdened with a job?

My frustration has become so bad it has affected my friendships and my overall happiness. When I'm at home with peers who understand the woes of paying bills and having to budget their money that they earned, I feel like I belong. I realize how lucky I am to have a loving family who has supported me in all my endeavors, even though we are not financially stable. But when I'm here, I feel subpar, unequal, and a terrible longing for the privileges others have."

Things got worse when my parents ""accidentally"" mentioned in front of you that a kid of a family friend majors in Comp Sci and got an intern at Microsoft or Amazon with 7000 dollar a month, whereas I worked my ass off during the semester in a research lab (I can work up to 20 hours per week sometimes with a huge course workload) and got a bit more than minimum wage. Sometimes at midnight I cannot fall asleep, because there are lots of questions whirling in my head: Do I even have the abilities to eventually fulfill my academic dreams? I don't think I am smart enough! Or should I follow other people and do what is most lucrative? But it is too late for me to change, and unfortunately I don't have interest for comp sci or business or whatever...Anyway I kinda just want to know I am not alone."
1759,2015-01-11 23:46:43,"ctor of Gamma Chis has requested for me to remove confessions related to sorority recruitment. (Even the positive ones, which apparently are also negatively affecting the recruitment process)

For the time being, I'll just be hiding those confessions instead of deleting them. They'll be back when recruitment ends, but in the meantime, I'll let the recruitment process run its natural course to avoid adding any unnecessary stress. 

Best of wishes for the new semester.

Edit:

Honestly, I don't like this at all either.

If I don't comply, I risk being accused by other Greek organizations of spreading hate against them. The way some people see it, If I keep the posts, then I'm biased against sororities and I'm making their lives harder. Someone might even complain to the administration again. Either way, SOMEONE'S going to be unhappy. 

My gut feeling is to go with the community wants. So if anyone wants to voice their opinion on this matter, please do so - especially those involved in the rush process. I'll be watching this thread and will be reading every comment."
1760,2015-01-11 15:58:45,"When I was rejected from a sorority I thought I was going to get into, it was crushing.  It's absolutely true that you shouldn't base all your self-worth on how you end up doing in rush, and of course Greek Life isn't the most important thing in the world (obviously). But for someone who's been going through a bad time, or who's always felt out of place at WashU and been seriously thinking of transferring, or who's always dreamed of getting into a sorority, or who sees all their good friends getting bids and anticipates their group of friends drifting apart, that one sorority's rejection can be the straw that breaks the camel's back. For me, getting into this sorority felt like my last chance to get into a solid group of friends in college, but then they said they didn't want me.  Did you ever get rejected from a college you thought you would get into? Or get told you weren't good enough to be someone's friend? It's real, and it hurts. So please stop telling people things like that their ""priorities are seriously screwed up"" - you don't know their circumstances and you haven't walked in their shoes. K?"

I don't care that they don't like Frats, but I wish they would support what I want to do.

Side-note: I don't party that much, specifically I don't drink.  I just like the idea of meeting new guys and I've heard it can look good when applying to grad schools/applying for jobs.  Is it even worth it for me to rush?"

That at the end of the day, all that matters is where I end up. Trust me, a year later, I'm beyond happy with the sorority I'm in, and don't give two hoots about not getting a million invites. Yes, a million invites are good for the ego, but the way I see it is at the end of the day you're only in ONE chapter for the next four years. Make the most of the people who are interested in you!"
1767,2015-01-10 22:59:57,I confess that I'm appalled at how much self worth so many supposedly smart people have tied up in the Greek popularity contest. You'd seriously just drop out if you don't get into a sorority? Wow. Just wow. Greek life isn't the only way to experience college and it's not the end of the world if you don't get in.

1770,2015-01-10 19:00:12,"I'm bothered by the number of people using our WashU class pages to find a taxi partner for two main reasons: I get that you might be carrying some bags, but is it really that hard to take the Metro? WashU gives us free passes (so many students at other schools would be jealous) and the ride only takes twenty minutes. Think of how wasteful and bad for the environment it is to have hundreds of cabs driving people from the airport. Secondly, 1700 other people don't care about you arriving at the airport. While there isn't a dedicated page (yet)  for this purpose, it is very irritating to keep seeing and getting notifications for something that does not concern the whole class.  Just man/woman up, and take the Metrolink for its designed purpose.  As a side note, WashU went out of its way with community and financial support to have two Metrolink stations on campus during its construction; don't let that go to waste."

As a sophomore I had at least a few friends in each and thought my conversations went really well the whole day. I think I am an attractive and interesting person, so I don't understand what could've gone wrong. I don't understand how I didn't get invited back to any of my top choices. I was so nervous to come back to school, and now that this isn't working out, I am seriously considering withdrawing and going back home."

1779,2015-01-08 19:37:28,"I'm an incoming Freshman (Class of 2019), and I confess that the posts on this page sometimes scare me. Then I realize how incredibly real all these posts are and am excited to spend 4 years at a school with people who aren't scared to say (type out) how they truly feel."
1780,2015-01-08 19:10:29,"I confess that I've been swiping right on tinder for all of the guys that I went to high school with just to see which ones thought I was attractive. When it's a match, I undo it immediately. It's a pretty rude thing to do. That said, I have concluded that I missed out on SO many opportunities back then. Maybe I wasn't as much of a dork as I thought I was."
1781,2015-01-08 17:18:32,"This is gonna be a bit long, but there’s a gem at the end.

I confess that I’ve spent too many a Friday night like poster #2028 sitting in my room because I had no one to socialize with. I confess that, like so many of you, I came to WashU hoping I’d quickly find my network of close friends, that I’d bond perfectly with my floor, that all my Friday nights would be spent having fun with the people around me. It was a short-lived dream.

(While my life is by far not bad at all,) I confess that there have been some times last semester where I could’ve posted a confession to that effect had I wanted to, but didn’t because like 3 people already did that day and it would be redundant.

There are so, so many of us here who feel this way. Who feel scared of being alone. “And the funny thing is,” poster #2028 says, “so many people feel this way at WashU.. yet how come we can’t find each other?”

Well, I want to change this. I’ve been inspired by the fact that, below every confession about fear of isolation there’s a comment suggesting “message me” or “let’s hang out sometime”. I’m inspired by poster #2021 who reminded me that our community is why I fell in love with this school. I’m privileged to be involved in extracurriculars that have shown me how valuable it is to have a group of people you can always go to on campus, and I want to create this kind of community for everyone here at WashU.

So, here goes. Finally putting down this idea of mine on paper…

I want to create an unofficial no-commitment “group” called Hangout Fridays. It’ll be a place where people can go to hang out and meet new people on Friday nights. I envision that, maybe, you’ll be able to make new friends around the Cards Against Humanity table, or perhaps if you bond better over video games, you can head to the WiiU for a round of Smash Bros with like minded individuals. If you’re like me, an introvert thirsting for some real, serious conversation, maybe head to the philosophy or politics circle and engage in mind-expanding debate with your peers. Maybe you’re like “I don’t need none of this, I just wanna play a freaking board game with ppl” Then you can play a board game.

The idea is that it’ll be a place for all of us who have ever spent a Friday night alone in our dorm rooms. It’s for those of us whose amazing Facebook statuses mask our inner emptiness. It’s for those who feel utterly alone, but also for anyone who… well, has ever felt alone at one point and/or has wanted to play a freaking board game.

Can we get together as a community and stop being isolated voices crying out in the darkness? Can we create a safe place for people to go just have fun, branch out and make friends without the fear of social stigma? As Poster #2021 asked us, “Let’s all try to make one big party where we come with no tags but merely interests.”

This isn’t the Social Attitudes Club. If you want social advice to fix a deep-seated social problem, go there. I went once, and although it’s great, I found that for me, and probably the hundreds of others like me, that’s not what I need.

Please note that this is so, so not set in stone. The group will grow organically and will always be super open to suggestions. I just want to stop this enervating milieu of alienation and channel our community to do something good.

I know I would love to have something like this in place at our school, but now I need to know if Wash U feels the same, and for that I’m going to need support. Sorry for the blatant like-whoring but if you want to see this happen or be a part of it, like this post + tell your friends. (Suggestions? Please comment!)

Let’s stop dreading Friday nights and start saying TGIF instead.

But he's a great guy and maybe I should just accept that and believe that I'll grow to like him. Because maybe this is my only chance. And I just don't want to end up alone..."
1783,2015-01-08 13:21:35,I think I'm in love with the WashU confessions page admin. He's so friendly and cares so much about this community. I wonder if there is a way to get to know him better?

1786,2015-01-08 02:53:40,"I confess that I don't deny my sexuality, but I'm not very ""in your face"" about it either. Not too many people on campus know I'm gay, but that's just because the topic really hasn't come up. I can't seem to find a way to make it a part of my life without announcing it in a way that makes it a bigger deal than it is, but I want to find more ways to be out and visible."
1787,2015-01-08 02:57:41,"Second half of my senior year of high school I went to anger management that was mandated by an attorney in exchange for his services - this was three years ago and I was such a different person, I can't look back now. Anyway, the classes worked wonders, but recently I have noticed an ugly trend which is me getting mad to the point where I am dizzy and start to black out. My father had severe anger issues (probably where I get it from) and still does, he just has mellowed out in his older years. I'm terrified of the impact on my mental and physical health that this resurgence of anger is having as well as how it's affecting those I care about. Today I screamed so loudly that talking at work hurt. I'm embarrassed at how I handled myself, I thought I was beyond this. I'm terrified and don't want to take a step backward."
1788,2015-01-08 01:09:42,I got on birth control because my boyfriend and I started having sex a lot and we didn't want to use condoms anymore. The birth control completely kills my sex drive and makes me super moody. I never want to do anything further than making out and during my periods I am a cranky bitch who doesn't want to be physical in any way; holding hands or even cuddling. I feel super guilty that I am withholding the physical aspect of a relationship with my boyfriend but I actually enjoy not being obnoxiously horny all the time.
1789,2015-01-08 00:47:43,"My mom is an alcoholic, and I'm afraid that I can't save her. She won't even admit that she has a problem, but my whole family knows it. Every night, i confront her about it, but we fight every time I say something. Her drunkedness is really altering her mood, making her extremely angry or loopy. I can't take seeing her like this anymore. She's my mom, but I feel like I have to take care of her. Except I don't know how to take care of her because she has always been the one taking care of me. I know you shouldn't help people that don't want to be helped, but she's my frickin mom. I have to help her. Advice please!"
1790,2015-01-08 00:22:45,I confess that I truly don't understand why girls get frustrated when guys leave the seat up... are they all that scared of falling in the toilet or is there something I'm missing?
1791,2015-01-08 00:36:48,"To confession 2023: I feel you. I never thought I'd say this, but I dreaded friday nights more than anything last semester.. Friday nights are when I realize I'm more lonely than ever. Friday nights are when I want to socialize, be with people, and have fun, but only to realize I have no one but myself and that all my ""friends"" are busy with something/someone else. Friday nights are when I can no longer use studying as an excuse to avoid my loneliness...  and as an extrovert, I can't imagine going through a semester like that again... I'm officially scared of Friday nights at WashU. Scared of being alone.

And the funny thing is, so many people feel this way at WashU.. yet how come we can't find each other? Maybe it's that we're scared to reveal ourselves, scared of being vulnerable. It makes sense, because that's exactly what I'm doing, hiding under the mask of anonymity.

I wish it will get better... but I don't know how telling myself these empty words over and over again will help anymore."

1796,2015-01-07 17:53:56,"I confess that I was very excited for my first year of college but I felt incredibly lonely this past semester. It's been hard for me to make friends and after coming home and seeing some old friends and family, I'm dreading going back. I really think I would love WashU if I could meet some people I click with, but right now the idea of returning and being alone sounds terrible. I am not even sure how to approach people but I just don't want to be as lonely as I felt all of last semester. I've definitely missed the comfort and familiarity of my family and friends back home."
1797,2015-01-07 17:43:57,I confess that I think the best part of sorority recruitment is that all of them deactivate their facebook pages so I don't have to see their stupid sorority-related posts.
1798,2015-01-07 17:04:58,"There's quite a bit that I'd like to say, but fortunately it all sort of revolves around the same point: community.

To be honest, when I first visited Wash U after getting accepted, I felt this rush of friendliness and welcomeness from everyone I came into contact with. This wasn't just limited to the OWL hosting me or their friends. No, I got this warm feeling from literally everyone: nerds, jocks, fraternity brothers, sorority sisters, acapella kids, etc. I felt blessed that I was going to be attending a place where, I thought, everyone was a part of this family - everyone just had their own little pods or groups that they were just a little closer with.

It was magical to be blunt with you all. It may seem romanticized, but I guarantee you all saw the same thing - this unconditional love between each and every person on this campus. I didn't see people hating on someone else for choosing to be in a fraternity. There weren't kids picking on others for studying on a weekend night. Nobody was backbiting about kids in their acapella cliques or their sorority squads. Again, I thought for sure there was this unconditional love among us all.

Freshman year came around, and I continued to see that. That's the beautiful thing about freshman year - we're all so innocent and pure that we only see the best in each other with no reservations about who we meet or become best friends with. Each interaction we made was precious to us, meant the world to us.

Yet suddenly we all join our respective groups: frats, sororities, acapella groups, sports clubs, business frats, etc., and just like that we've turned against one another. People who aren't in acapella group will look at them and be like ""My god, they're so cliquey."" Girls in one sorority will look down on those in another sorority. People who once shared shots and memories together now look at each other with disgust and it's repulsing.

And from then on the community is literally split down so many lines its like a jigsaw puzzle, but the pieces don't ever fit together perfectly. We end up not associating with each other because apparently our groups now have to identify us instead of the other way around. And as we get sucked into this mentality, we begin to think that everyone is in their own clique and the community continues to fragment.

That shouldn't be the case though. Why can't we recognize that our groups and organizations are just things that we chose to be a part of. Instead of identifying as part of this fraternity or this club or that group, why not identify as students of this University or members of the Wash U community. It may seem that everyone is cliquey or reserved or group-centric, but we just think this because we're much the same way. Break these clouds that we've put on our groups and organizations and let's build this community back. Let's build a community where a guy who isn't in an acapella group can be best friends and hang out with someone who is in one. Let's develop a place where kids don't feel like rushing or going through recruitment is a biased thing but is something where everyone is just looking for their best friends. Let's all try to make one big party where we come with no tags but merely interests.

This isn't just targeted to those who are in groups or organizations though. To those who feel like they're on the outside looking in, honestly I was like you once, but I chose to stop being so critical of everything and now I feel welcome. I'm very much like all of you still, but I don't feel so outside anymore. Honestly, strip all your notions of the people you think so harshly of and go get to know them. You'd be surprised at how willing they are to meet you too. I used to think that if I didn't make a good first impression that I could never talk to someone or be friends with them. I also thought that if I didn't have an in with someone that I wouldn't ever get close with them. As cliche as it may sound, I was wrong. I said hello to someone. Asked others if they wanted to grab a bite to eat. Shared my life stories with many. All of this with people who I thought I could never talk to, and now some of them are my best friends.

All I'm saying is, keep an open mind about everyone. Don't ever think negatively of someone. Be welcoming of everyone that you meet. That's what makes this university great. It's filled with people who love unconditionally and see only the best in each other. There's an atmosphere of compassion and understanding that sits in every booth in BD and every seat on Main Campus. And who knows, maybe there will actually be this big party one day.

I would post a TL;DR, but I think the effect comes from reading the whole rant."

1801,2015-01-06 00:18:14,"I've been dating my boyfriend for a while now and while I love his fraternity and the brothers in it, I can't help but notice that the environment perpetuates this idea that being in a relationship is ""lame"" or ""uncool"". I feel like he's constantly fighting a battle between being cool in the eyes of his brothers or having a girlfriend. It's like the only way to be fully accepted is to hook up with tons of girls and brag about it. And if you're in a relationship, you're probably whipped and you're not fun anymore. This isn't meant to hate on fraternities; I have lots of close friends in them but I just wish it wasn't so looked down upon to be in a relationship with someone you truly care about."
1802,2015-01-06 00:51:15,WashU's rigorous academics and the pressure to perform up to the standards set by my peers have directly led to my being addicted to and dependent on Adderall.

1808,2015-01-05 19:36:26,"As a gay man, I'm honestly convinced that being gay is a choice. I genuinely was attracted to females my whole life, and then a year ago, I chose to try something new. i now am only attracted to men (which I was not before) but I believe i could choose to go back at any point (I'm not bisexual). Just my personal opinion, but from experience I can tell you it;s a choice!"
1809,2015-01-05 11:36:28,Joining WashU acappella has been easily the best decision of my college career.
1810,2015-01-05 11:27:29,"I know i'll probably get flak for this in the comment section but as a junior I hate the fraternity system at Wash U.   I have a couple of amazing friends in fraternities and I think their awesome but every one of them tells me that the rush process is basically just a facade.

 They tell me that nearly 90% of the rush class is basically already decided before rush starts and their is lots of dirty rushing where certain of the 90% are invited to the house outside of normal rush events to get to know brothers (and have basically an auto leg up when decisions are made). They tell me that to be part of that 90% you have to had already known a couple brothers very well and already become friends with them (at open frat parties which are apparently part of the rush process) so they will vet for you.

Even then, I've also heard reports of the shallowness of especially some of the frats.  ""He doesn't LOOK like someone who'd be in our frat"" as in someone who is excessively handsome and will pull women.  like i thought you're supposed to be a fraternity of brothers? brothers aren't supposed to be superficial, their supposed to love you for who you are inside.

The fact that I knew none of this before really irks me because it all seems blatantly unfair.  I am not super handsome but I tend to think i am a pretty friendly and genuine guy.  I also had always been under the impression that everyone at rush was on an equal footing when the official process starts.  The fact that it isn't and this is hidden from people makes me want go to the houses and burn them all down because its utter bullshit and really hurts a lot of kids self esteem (speaking from experience) and seems to be a terrible system."
1811,2015-01-05 11:37:32,"Kinda concerned. Break is boring, so I had to pick up a hobby.

Anyway, I've legitimately lost count as to how many girls and guys I've hooked up with over winter break."
1812,2015-01-05 02:49:34,I confess that I requested a smaller size on my recruitment registration because I didn't want sororities to judge me for my size. Now I'm worried they're going to judge me because my rush shirt doesn't fit.
1813,2015-01-05 01:25:35,"An ""I miss you"" text from the boy who broke my heart has got to be the best and worst thing. Part of me just got over him and the other part of me wants him back."
1814,2015-01-04 19:18:37,"Current first-year here. Over the summer I analyzed each a Cappella group on campus, making lists of which ones I would love to be in. I hadn't sung in a formal setting in years, and I was never incredibly good, but I love singing and music. When I got on campus and looked into auditioning, I felt extremely intimidated by the a cappella culture on campus. Every group seems to be so cliquey and exclusive, and it just doesn't seem fun. I also felt so judged by almost all the current a cappella members. It drove me away from auditioning for something I've wanted to do for years. My mom was more disappointed than I was, and I hate to make her upset and let her down.

So even though I go to the concerts and wish I could be onstage singing, now when I see the a cappella cliques on campus being oh-so-exclusive and holier than thou, I'm kind of glad I didn't get caught up in that lifestyle."
1815,2015-01-04 18:04:38,"I really don't want the semester to start... I remember i used to look forward to being with friends and having fun all the past semesters, but now all my ""friends"" have their own friends, boyfriends/girlfriends, and there's nothing back at college for me other than school work. i know it's too late to make new friends at this point, even though everyone tells you it's never too late. everyone may be nice when i approach them, but i always feel left out because they already have a steady group of best friends... and this is why i stopped trying so hard to find new friends but instead tried to stick with the people i know, even though they don't consider me the kind of friend i consider them to be.

oh well. at least i still have my laptop."
1816,2015-01-04 17:23:40,"I confess that the thing I was looking most forward to when coming to college was joining an a cappella group. I know that I am a really good singer but I am really shy and was always afraid that somebody would tell me that I am not as good as I think I am.

So every time I went to sign up for auditions, I chickened out. Now I am a second-semester senior, and not trying out is my biggest regret to date."
1817,2015-01-04 17:02:41,I confess that I really want to warn the guy my friend is dating that he's making the biggest mistake of his life.
1818,2015-01-04 14:45:42,"I confess that I will probably not be able to rush this semester due to academic reasons. I am scared that all my friends are rushing and that I will be missing out on a lot of fun. While I understand academics are my priority, I am not looking forward to next semester because I fear I will have no social life. All my friends I made last semester are planning on rushing and I feel like I am going to be left behind.

I know I can always rush as a sophomore, but has anybody gone through this before? Will I survive even if all my friends are rushing? Also, how seriously does IFC enforce the 2.5 GPA rule? What if I have a 2.49?"
1819,2015-01-04 13:26:43,"I confess that my family does not have money to support me through my second year of college. But after the first semester I have made extraordinary achievements both academically and extracurricularly. I am not really worried because I have several plans to get myself supported, albeit they are all actually long-shots. Next semester will be the biggest challenge in my life up to now. I believe I have my fate in my own hands."

1821,2015-01-04 11:47:48,"I've recently realized I lack a true personality of my own. I take whichever person I feel closest to and start to become more like them. It isn't a conscious idealization, more like I am absorbing part of who they are into myself so that I can seem to have a personality. I didn't realize this was even happening until it became a problem. I was thinking about converting to another religion for the 3rd time (not just interdenominational conversions, like Islam to Christianity conversions). I had no idea how the idea to become a casual catholic  popped into my head until I realized 2 of my closest friends identified that way. This realization honestly scares me because I feel like a whiteboard that other people keep writing on, and eventually I'll run out of space while having written nothing myself. Does this happen to other people? Are there some of you out there who also don't know who you are?"
1822,2015-01-04 11:14:49,"I confess that after having dated couple people and going through all the heart-breaking shit and stuff, I've become so much light-hearted in being in a relationship now. Despite being a female, I don't hold back anxiously waiting for the guy to approach me first anymore, but rather make the first move and pursue whatever I want - which is really fun and exciting. However, there are times where I inevitably worry about seeming too desperate or even slutty because of my outspoken actions. I also worry that I might have convinced myself too well that no such thing as an ""everlasting"" love exists, thinking that even if this relationship doesn't work out, that's fine because there will be a next one eventually - which really affects the depth of the affection I share with the person I am currently in a relationship with. Maybe I'm just scared of being too committed and not getting the same response from the other person. I can't really decide what's right or wrong."
1823,2015-01-03 21:35:52,"One of my best friends from home might transfer to SLU and is so excited about the prospect of hanging out all the time. It'll be nice to see her more often, but I think if she lived locally it might ruin our friendship. I was the only one from my high school to come to WashU, and I'd rather keep my home friends at home and my school friends at school, and not mix the two."
1824,2015-01-03 19:53:53,"When I was little I had what my parents considered an ""unhealthy obsession"" with facial hair. I wanted a full bushy pirate beard. When other little girls had rainbows painted on their cheeks, I had beards. By the time I was ten, they thought I had gotten over it. I never got over it. I find myself most attracted to men with beards and facial hair. I love stroking them. I'll say it - I'm a beard lover. Come at me hairy men."
1825,2015-01-03 11:37:55,"I didn't wash my sheets at all during freshman or sophomore year. Yesterday my mom told me that people should wash their sheets at least once a week... My New Years Resolution is to wash them at least once a year, because even that would be an improvement for me."
1826,2015-01-03 11:02:56,"I confess that I'm completely devoid of all motivation and purpose. My senior year of high school was probably one of the worst years of my life. I had a terrible summer right afterwards, where my long term boyfriend and I had a nasty breakup, and I worked nonstop to distract myself from the pain. I didn't get a chance to mentally recover, from the physical and mental damage of everything that happened during the previous year. Iwas so excited to go to school, and honestly I really like it at WashU. But its a shallow happiness; during the day I have fun: I've made lots of great friends and am involved in multiple activities I really enjoy. But as soon as I notice that I'm enjoying myself I feel my attention getting removed from reality, I feel purposeless. While I enjoy being around a lot of the friends I have made, I find myself not caring about my work, or finding any ambition whatsoever. And despite this, I've managed to do really well in all of my classes, and have a job that the version of me from two years ago would do anything to have. Yet I feel nothing. I fear that my emotions are slipping away. I have no desire to return to school after break, which is a shame and honestly surprises me greatly because I thought I was doing better. I just don't know what to do with myself. And I'm scared."
1827,2015-01-03 11:57:57,I'm really scared to lose my virginity.
1828,2015-01-03 00:40:58,"I've been paranoid about my gf cheating on me over break. She's great, and I have no justifiable reason to think she would, but I can't shake this nagging feeling that her one of her friends in particular is more than just friends. I know it's probably just me, but I just wish she wouldn't be as distant over break, and I'd like some reassurance from her.

I doubt I'm alone in this, so to all you boys and girls in relationships, if you haven't been in touch often over break, get in touch more this last week. Let them know they matter."
1829,2015-01-02 23:43:11,"I think it's absurd that I can't see what textbooks I need for my classes until the bookstore has them in stock. In many cases, the bookstore doesn't receive them until the last minute, when it is too late to order them online. End the bookstore's attempted monopoly!"

1831,2015-01-02 23:01:14,"I confess that I started dating a boy on campus freshman year because he had a nice car and a lot of money. He is hot and well-liked on campus. I don't love him but we've been dating for over three years now and we're graduating this May. Honestly I'm in love with another guy who has no money and I want to tell him but I feel like I'd be letting a lot of people down. The guy I'm dating is almost definitely going to propose to me once we graduate, but I don't know what to do."
1832,2015-01-02 10:43:15,"I got my LSAT score back today. With next to no preparations (finished 2 previous tests, that's it) I've got a 96th percentile. I don't really know what I should feel because I'm pre-grad and I'm only taking the LSAT for some weird, personal reasons and I have no intention to apply to law schools whatsoever. However now I have a score way better than that of my GRE (which I did spend time to prep for). I'm a senior so there's nothing I can do at this moment really but I just want a place to share my super ambivalent feelings about this and not sound like bragging...can't talk about this to my friends because they just assume I'm bragging and I know some of them to whom LSAT really matters spent a lot of time prepping and got a much lower score on the same test. I don't think I'm talented in what being a good lawyer requires (I'm extremely aversive to any sort of conflicts to the extent that I'd make concessions I shouldn't make just to avoid conflict). I guess I'll just say why don't grad schools accept LSAT."

1834,2015-01-02 10:00:21,"I had my heart broken about 9 months ago by my first love. I was supposed to be over this by now but as time passes, I still feel just as stuck and suffocated as before. I don't think I love him anymore; he's hurt me too much for that. But the pain from what he did to me still resonates. I can't help but feel cynical about the concept of love. He's left me feeling worthless when it comes to love and just completely unloveable and I hate that I've given him that much power but it's true. I see pictures of him with his new girlfriend and it just makes me wonder what made me not worth the effort. On December 31st, I told myself that it was the last time I would let myself cry over him, that 2015 was a new era for me, but here I am holding back tears. It makes me wonder if the cliche that it's better to have loved and lost than to never have loved at all is true because I was just so much happier and confident before."

My parents think I should see them since it's free for the first few visits, but I've heard quite a few negative things and am not sure.  I'd love to hear about other people's experiences if anyone is willing, or advice of what to do or think about before hand, or anything else really."
1837,2015-01-01 23:47:25,"Unique ways to keep warm when your parents are cutting back on the energy bill...
1) Dont go to the bathroom without socks,  the floor is too damn cold. Simple.  We all know this.
2) Make quesadilla. When finished, hover the pan a few inches from your face and neck, it is glorious I promise.
3) Dry laundry on hot setting. Throw hot pile on bed. Lay on pile until toasty. Leave laundry for someone else to do.
4) Grab dog or cat and use their warmth. Ignore annoyed growls or hissing. You're too cold to care.
5) Lie under beanbag chair(s), after a while your warmth will insulate really well under there. Kind of like a crude synthetic sleeping bag
6) Put laptop on lap. Download hella shit while watching netflix until your lap is toasty. Who cares about gonads overheating or whatever
7) Dress so heavily in the house that it becomes a passive aggressive attack on your parents not using the heater.
8) Play wii sports with friends to get the blood pumping.
9) Pack your bags and go back to washu, where you can use the heat as much as you damn please with heaters that even on low winter setting seem to want to make your furniture spontaneously combust."
1838,2015-01-01 19:08:26,"I'm a guy, and a few years ago I accepted money for sex.  I degraded myself for a measly hundred dollars.  I'm disgusted at what I did, and I'm still haunted by my choice.  It was an important experience, though, because it taught me to value myself.  Now I know that I'm worth more than I sold myself for."
1839,2015-01-01 13:56:28,"FREAKING NEW YEAR! I hope everyone's been enjoying some time off from work and school. I wanted to take some time to thank everyone for the support I've been getting since I took over early last year. 

Sometimes I recognize people on campus from the Confessions community and I REALLY want to say hi and thank them for being so awesome - but I can't do that, so I'd like to at least say here that the support that people have given me has truly meant a lot. I hope you feel that we've added a new dimension to the community that otherwise would not exist.

1841,2014-12-31 17:06:32,"I confess that I am religious, and, even more, Christian. I do not support slavery, and it is not because I am black; rather, it is because the Bible does not support it. I do not support the marginalization of anyone who is different than me because the Bible does not support it. I do not support the subjugation of women because the Bible does not either. The Bible is less of a rule book and more of a mirror, a mirror that shows us the state of humanity and our need for redemption from a being who loves us enough to offer it.  With the recent suicides that have been seemingly attributed to the Bible and its adherents, I thought this necessary because some, a minority of Christians, have used the Bible's influence to support their agendas (slave owners and sexists and hypocrites). No, I'm not claiming moral high ground over these other Christians, for I'm as messed up as they are.  I am simply bringing attention to a book that the public takes little time to understand, something that many think its followers commit also."

But now that I have experienced hookups, some good, most bad, I really just want a guy to have sex with that cares about me out of decency with no attachments after graduation."
1848,2014-12-29 21:11:42,"I confess that as a queer woman, I have many difficulties about my Christian upbringing. How can I follow a religious practice that has the marginalization of women interwoven in its text? I don't believe in societal patriarchy, but I was raised to respect religious patriarchy. It's all a bundle of confusion. It's like I have to be a self-respecting woman or a Christian, but I can't seem to mitigate them both."

1853,2014-12-28 21:51:52,"I hate my parents. I really do. I put so much effort in school and this semester I've gotten my best grades yet, my lowest being a B, but I'm not good enough for them apparently, and instead I get yelled at for being involved in extracurriculars when I should be focused more on work, even though extracurriculars are what keep me sane and happy.

Especially because, well, what if you didn't have a great and awesome break and instead you really hated it? It's interesting that no one ever says they're break was bad because no one wants to hear negativity; we always expect positivism and the best. Can we change that, so its completely fine that I say I hated my break and hated going home?"

I get caught up in the fact that I am still in a straight relationship, which I don't necessarily want to end, which I think gets really hard for other people, even myself, to understand if I am in fact gay, which I really think I am. I have almost emailed several friends, but I don't even know what to say, I'm not the type to talk about relationshipy things anyways, and this is too difficult for me to articulate. For now the best I can muster is this little confession."

1867,2014-12-24 03:47:25,"I'm honestly pretty sick and tired of the way that sororities are run. I would have no issue with the idea of sororities, but they create cliques and exclude others while trying to sell an image based on a ""sisterhood"" that is actually surrounded by exclusivity, and tries to market that to others and make others feel like they want to be a part solely because they would otherwise feel excluded."

My mother never really seems to know where it is, and her nonchalance about its whereabouts frankly upset me because she clearly doesn't see the importance of the ornament. It's more than just an object. It feels like I'm the only one that cares - about the ornament,  about his lack of presence."
1872,2014-12-23 12:28:34,"I confess that I googled my girlfriend's home address in California out of boredom. According to Zillow, it's worth over $2M.

1876,2014-12-23 12:27:40,"Hello to all my classmates at Wash U,

I am an African American man who has an issue with many African American members of our campus. I grew up in a privileged area with mostly wealthy people, who happen to be white. Just because I don't walk around using slang, don't go to the meetings on Friday, and don't sit at the 'black' tables does not mean I'm not black.

Why is the color of my skin suppose to determine how I act? Isn't that exactly what you are all fighting against? I'm a product of my environment and so are you. Don't try to ostracize me because I don't act how you think I should. I am me and you are you. Deal with it.

But recently, I've felt so empowered lifting weights.  I love feeling sore the next morning and feeling like I'm growing. I feel like a freakin man (without looking like one) and it's amazing. Girls, I encourage you to go lift. Being in a testosterone-filled room has more perks than you'd think."

1879,2014-12-23 01:14:43,"My GPA for the fall semester was awful. I am going to be put on academic probation for sure, and there is no way that I will be able to pledge in the spring.

My initial response was to act like I didn't care. Of course this didn't fare well with my parents, who had been hopeful all semester long. Conflict arose from my failure to understand why they couldn't be satisfied with my excuse of, ""Oh, it's normal to have a bad first semester,"" which might be true, but what does that matter? Those C's on my transcript weren't going anywhere...

Slowly, I realized my own disappointment and regret. ""Maybe I'm not cut out for this,"" I wondered, ""Maybe I don't actually belong here..."" I contemplated withdrawing from WashU, perhaps throwing away any chance of obtaining my dream job in the future. Confidence in my ability to succeed in anything seemed to dwindle.

Further introspection made me cut the BS. I recognized my failure to own up to the fact that this is MY education and MY future on the line; I am solely responsible for those marks on my transcript, regardless of all those problems that happened during the first month of the semester. Sure, I wasn't ready for the sheer workload that is college, but again, who's to blame for that?

This awareness brought me to the conclusion that it will take some planning to make sure I prevent this kind of dissatisfactory performance from ever happening again. Pinpointing each and every flaw in my studying habits culminated in a step-by-step method, customizable for any and every class, that is sure to guarantee my future academic success. Moreover, I've begun to work at my issues with being too prideful and determined the importance of forming a relationship with my professors; if I fall behind, it's always a good idea to contact them immediately instead of combatting unnecessary stress and wasting away in half-hearted review.

In the end, I realized that even though I started on the wrong foot with my college education, it is okay, really. I've learned from my mistakes and constructed a comprehensive plan for how to study next semester and, with the help of my friends and family to keep me accountable, I am now truly confident that I can bring my GPA up to par.

The point of this confession was to offer myself as an example for those who suffered a bad semester and are lost in terms of what they should do going forward, fellow freshmen in particular. Save for a few outliers that suffered truly unique circumstances to result in poor academic performance, I'm sure many of you can relate to -- what can simply be described as -- my study habits associated with laziness and reluctance to take my classes seriously.

Say what you will, but I am a firm believer of the notion that we were given a truly wonderful opportunity in our entrance to college; an opportunity by which one can only unlock its full potential with exceptional performance in academia, in addition to its many other beneficial aspects (aka I'm still going to party on the weekends).

I hope that even one of you that read through this wall of text will be inspired and find a real motivation to learn and succeed.

Happy holidays everybody, and a happy New Year! :)"
1880,2014-12-23 01:04:45,I've gotten head in Olin so many times they should call it the D-stacks.
1881,2014-12-23 01:41:48,"I think the events of the past few months have changed my life in a big way. Before all of this I'd been really interested in St. Louis' (and America's) long history of racism but now I feel for sure it's no longer possible to ignore what's right in front of us all. The topic is so volatile that debate/discussion easily and often devolves into a shouting match between two opposing camps, which I think points to a fundamental problem in our discourse but also within society, one that's built into our cities, into the patterns of where we live. I'm talking about segregation, which as washu students we should all be keenly aware of. 

Our school sits almost directly on the racial faultline of the city. To drive from Clayton to a neighborhood like Wells-Goodfellow is to travel from one world to another in only a matter of miles. There's definitely relatively integrated and diverse parts of the region but by and large blacks and whites live apart. Beyond the inherent inequality in this situation, it makes it harder for us to engage with and understand each other--out of sight, out of mind. We shouldn't accept the state of affairs or perpetuate the division any longer. Easier said than done, but at least it's worth striving toward."
1882,2014-12-23 00:49:49,"I'm curious to know the gender of the admin? And what he or she is like outside of Confessions. It's kinda like how you know your professors only in class and not outside of school and that astonishment and rippling warmth that floods one when one sees them just living life.

========================================

I was a dude the last time I checked (which was literally a few seconds ago, just to make sure I wasn't lying to you). 

It's hard for me to really give an accurate description of who I am because I go through a lot of changes - not in a bad way or anything, I just make a lot of changes to my life when I see something isn't working right. 

I guess one thing that has remained constant throughout the years is that I always have a goal to work towards, and I'll work my ass off to try to get it. That's why confessions were posted at 4 AM so many times this semester. I'm aware of what isn't good in my life, things I could change, how I could improve, and what my priorities should be. I'm trying to graduate early from Wash U for financial reasons and also to get closure on some personal problems in my life, but that's still a little down the line. I'll likely be looking for a new admin when that happens. 

Either way, it doesn't matter too much who I am! I think it's important that there's no identity behind the administrator, not right now anyway. I think people would feel weird knowing who reads their confessions. I also remain anonymous for my own personal safety, but a few people have guessed who I am by the way I talk and by my personality (I've denied it each time). 

Hope you have a nice Winter Break!

(By the way, I checked again and I'm still a dude. I'll update this response if that changes overnight or something)"

I just got into med school and I've always gotten good grades, but I simply never cared to do the readings. I'd usually use sparknotes or get my friend's notes and that's how I generally passed English. I didn't post this to be judged (even though I know I will be). I posted this to ask for help. I honestly don't know where to start and I feel much to dumb to ask for help now. I've never told ANYONE this. Sooo yea....."

1887,2014-12-22 19:11:57,"There was a point in the semester where I didn't have five dollars to get a sandwich at Subway. I hadn't eaten in three days and was digging through all of my pockets for change. It made me feel so worthless. I would say I didn't have a dollar to my name, but additionally my bank account was $200 in the negative. None of my friends have any idea that I'm living in poverty. Lower class people can't afford to say that money doesn't buy happiness."
1888,2014-12-22 15:25:58,"I think people are misunderstanding what some people like post #1922 and the ""depressing"" #1919 are trying to say. They aren't pointing out that ALL jobs require a good GPA, or that to ""be the next Bill Gates"" (as unlikely as #1922 points out) you must have a 4.0. I think the main idea of #1919 is that, for the specific student who is pre-med, which is not everyone, GPA does matter, and that it is naive to say otherwise. It may be unfortunate that that is the way admissions to medical schools are set up, but it's not going to change anytime soon: GPA is a major preliminary determinant of whether a school considers to invite you to an interview. 

It obviously isn't the only thing, but when they have thousands of applications to screen, I am positive that they go through rounds of screenings where they first look for minimum GPA and MCAT requirements before looking at your extracurriculars and what-have-you. So to the people telling their pre-med friends to stress less about classes/working hard for that A in a class, and more on ""doing what you love,"" that may not be the best advice. Because if being pre-med and studying science isn't what someone loves, and learning/studying something they're willing to devote many, many more years to, then it may be time to consider a different career choice. 

Being a physician requires people who love learning, as it is a continuous process. This isn't to say you can't have other passions too, of course; we don't want our future doctors to be robotic bookworms. At the same time, we want them to be qualified, and thorough, and as all-knowing as possible. This, unfortunately or not, is reflected to medical schools by doing well academically. Yes, ""fit"" to a medical school matters, but for people with an inadequate GPA, it isn't even about fit yet. It sucks, but GPA and other metrics like the MCAT are the way schools can evaluate all students without bias (keeping in consideration of course factors that may have prevented the student from doing super well on these things, such as having a job, etc.). So it is pointless to say ""I got ___ job with a *"

Yeap! When people were complaining that the confessions were getting depressing, I tried to think of something funny and relevant to lighten up the mood. I admit that I wrote this one: 

https://www.facebook.com/WashUConfessions/posts/963892523637563

I've also posted a more serious confession way earlier on in the year, but that's a different story. Looking back, it's weird how much my life has changed since I took over in September and it's hard to believe I wrote it."

I hated the insular academic world, I hated the idea of researching some tiny fragment of a topic for years, and I realized that I could teach outside of academia without losing anything. I had an advisor who suggested I think about a divorce when I was having work-life balance issues, which soured me greatly to the idea of staying in a field where my research on some insignificant centuries-old problem. I'm so much happier doing what I do now, and I caution people who have a single-minded focus on grad school to remember that there's a real work that you leave behind in the ivory tower of academia, if you're not careful."

1897,2014-12-22 01:43:25,"Response to recent flurry of GPA-themed posts:

Does GPA matter? Of course GPA matters. Rigorous coursework matters. Sleep matters. The tone you use with BD workers matters. The way you respond to friends going through hard times matters. The time you take to read the news in the morning matters. All of these things matter profoundly and so the question I think we should all be asking ourselves is not the extent to which things like GPA matter in our society, but how much we want them to matter in our own lives. Speaking as a senior with a good GPA and a nice post-grad job lined up, I often wonder whether I’d be happier if I had spent less of my energy on classroom performance and more energy actively engaging with other aspects of life. GPA certainly does factor into employability, but in terms of determining the worth of a person, it’s absolutely useless. I know people whom I respect very little with stellar GPAs and people whom I respect very much with mediocre numbers. A bad GPA shouldn’t stifle you—it should prompt you to think creatively about what you find interesting and exciting and what skills you possess that you can apply to that area of interest or passion beyond the strictures of classroom evaluation."

1899,2014-12-21 22:58:28,"As a recent graduate who's observed all these  depressing posts about GPA and stuff, I feel I should offer my own insights from my experience. Mostly, they're my take on some of the cliches people have posted or said to me personally. It's a long post, so you might want to grab a drink or two before reading.

First, as a student, you are, by definition, defined by your GPA. A student's goal is to study and your GPA is an assessment to your studies. Anyone who says otherwise is delusional, but I'll get to that in my second point. But just because you have to be defined by your GPA doesn't mean it has to be the ONLY thing defining you. Whether you want to be defined also by something else is up to you. Realistically speaking, unless you win a Nobel prize while in college, your GPA is still going to be your majority defining factor. It's not a rational way to define someone, but it is the reality; if you go to college, people are going to think in the back of their heads what your GPA is. But how much it matters is a mystery, and while I'm sure GPA matters more when applying for med school than an investment banking job, it's still only one of many factors that is incomprehensible by anyone outside of the people actually making the decisions.

Second, and this is what pisses me off the most personally, following the advice of people who say ""Your GPA dosen't define you"" or ""Follow your passions"" or any related spiels is a horrible idea. Why? Because these people might be one in a million. It's extremely easy for them to tell people that stuff but following their footsteps is irrational because they might've just lucked out on some aspects. Nothing is impossible, but that simply means the odds do not equal to zero. From a practicality standpoint, what you should acknowledge is not whether a goal is possible, but rather opportunity cost: is what you desire such an uphill battle that your time and energy are better devoted elsewhere? People always like to say ""You could be the next Bill Gates/Mark Zuckerberg/Steve Jobs."" Well you can't, because there's only one Bill Gates/Mark Zuckerberg/Steve Jobs. Just because you saw one person do it doesn't mean you could too.

Finally, realize that life is cruel. We probably all jumped for joy and frivolously bought an iPad or something when we got accepted to WashU. For all you folks struggling with your own personal problems: I hate to add insult to injury, but all this suffering you feel is indeed your own fault. You chose to come to WashU because of prestige or whatever other reason(s) and now look at what your decision rewards you with. Life is not a utopia; it's survival of the fittest. Employers, graduate schools, or even the classes you're taking right now aren't going to change solely because you're struggling. So ask yourself if you really have what it takes to progress in life, because as you've experienced for yourself, it's not easy, and if you don't have what it takes, you're simply going to get left behind and no one is going to care, because this planet is overpopulated anyways.

Sorry for the bluntness, but as someone who fell prey to words that gave me a false sense of hope, I at least want to try and ensure it doesn't happen to others too. People who tell you your GPA doesn't matter and anything related are trying to make you feel better when in reality, they're doing the exact opposite and don't even realize the damage they're doing. Telling someone it's all going to be fine isn't fine; it's worse than of doing nothing and not caring, because you're inadverdently setting people up for goals that they're not qualified for, and that forces these people to waste so much of their time that they could be putting to better use. People don't want to feel better; they want the truth.

But underneath all the cliches I've heard so far, there's one silver lining: your success is what you make of it. For me, probably many of you, coming to WashU was one of my biggest mistake. I could've easily achieved all the accomplishments I've had and my job if I had just gone to my state school, and saved a lot of money in the process. I have a friend at said state school who I remember was extremely disappointed that he didn't get into WashU. But he really made the most of what he does have and is thus having a better time there with a much better job lined up than I ever did at WashU.

To tie it all up, life is cruel. Your GPA does define you; believing those who tell you otherwise is foolish; using the success stories of one of a few individuals as inspiration is also foolish; and only the strong can really succeed, and maybe even survive, in life. But the only person who can make a difference in your life is you. So the next time you get rejected from med school or didn't get that job you want, just remember that only you get to decide whether there is still light at the end of the tunnel. And remember there is always resources around for you to capitalize on; it just may not be always so easy to spot.

Life isn't about setting goals and achieving them; it's about making the most of what you do have. Setting goals is only important in that it gives you the drive to progress in life. The bottom line is you can't have it all. There's a tradeoff to every choice you make, and every decision you make, whether it's right decision or a mistake, puts you in a different situation, and it's up to you to utilize your resources and decision-making to put you on the optimal next path.You're likely never going achieve the goals you've set for yourself, but if you optimize your tradeoffs well, you'll instead likely achieve something awfully close to whatever goal you have set.

That's all for now, folks. I'm out of beer and I think I've said enough for one night. If anyone has any questions, leave it in a comment, and I'll anonymously try to reply to you (So long as the admin will allow it).

And the worst part, the only person I felt like I could really tell this to is WashU confessions.

I don't need to figure out how to be smarter, because I'm already smart. I already know what I like and what I want to do with my life. Here's what I've learned so far during my time at WashU, shout out to the other learning disabled kids here.

You can succeed as a student here without learning a goddam thing. Whether or not you like it, it's true, and by the time you're an upperclassman, you'll know a good number of people who will be terrible in their fields but have insanely good GPAs. If you can learn and still suck at school, you can be great at school and not learn anything.

The best bathrooms are in Cupples II and Knight Hall. Next time you leave class because it feels like your brain is melting out of your ears, go pretend to take a shit while playing video games at one of these luxurious spots. Excellent WiFi as well if you have a nintendo ds or playstation vita for online gaming.

Don't bother studying with the kids in your classes unless they sit at the front of the lecture hall. You'll likely see them at Cornerstone when you take your exams, and these are the kids you'll make friends with. They are cool people and the only people you'll actually get to collaboratively work with without feeling like the slow kid in the group.

Stop thinking of yourself as ""disabled"" or ""retarded"". Keep in mind that the education system WashU upholds is fucking boring and probably worse than high school. The way these professors have to teach is annoying to them too, and they know it's not really effective. Most of them are pretty chill, but yea they look annoyed during class because they feel like they're wasting both their time and our time.

Don't listen to the haters. You know the types of kids I'm talking about. They don't know how much they make themselves look like total clowns.

Also remember that you're probably someone with lots of cool experiences that you got the chance to experience while you were sucking at school.

Chins up, you'll make it through school here even if it feels impossible at times. You'll have a fucking awesome life and you're gonna be a total baller. College is only four or five years long, and you've got a full lifetime of being awesome to do, so that really puts things in perspective.

Don't get me wrong, I'm consistently pushing myself to do better and set high goals for my career down the line, but knowing that I'm not alone in mediocre academic success is comforting.

I know it's not high school anymore and I can't expect 4.0s, but I also took a relatively easy course load (no math, science, Writing, or history), and yet I still couldn't get the grades I wanted.  And it's not like I spent all my time goofing off or partying; I worked hard for the grades I did receive.  I'm worried now that this is the highest GPA I'll ever get and as I take harder classes next semester, and the semesters after that, it's only going to get worse."

I know that there's always more time to work hard and raise my grades, but I just feel like such a fuck-up who's thrown his whole future away."

I have no regrets but rather only questions of regrets in some of the decisions I've made. I know it's impossible to have it all; there's a tradeoff to every choice one makes, but I personally wish now I prioritized my tradeoffs differently. Most importantly, I found a new club on campus not too long ago that's been gaining popularity, but the people hardly know me even now. Some still don't know what I'll be doing after college, and some of them didn't even know I've already graduated. They're all understanding of how much I had to sacrifice, but at the end of the day, they still consider me a stranger and it's still my fault. I wish it didn't have to be this way, but what's done is done, but still, it's food for thought."

My good grades and extracurriculars mean nothing to me when, at the end of the day, I have nobody who genuinely cares."
1921,2014-12-18 23:52:14,"This is my first semester as a freshman at Wash U. I took 18 credits and got a 3.95 GPA; I also got multiple leadership roles on campus. But in the end, I wish I had made more friends and am not still alone."

I didn't feel shame and disappointment- in fact, I felt relief.
I think now I can take the time to step back and reevaluate this career that my parents have wanted for me since birth. Now, I can take the time to truly be free."

I just don't know what to do now."
1924,2014-12-18 20:30:21,"I've had a GPA high enough to make summa in the old system (read: 3.8) for four consecutive semesters including this one, however I am freaking out because during my first three semesters here I'm screwing up as hard as someone possibly can. Although my overall GPA is decent now and everyone talks about how GPA doesn't matter that much for grad school once you've passed a certain cutoff and they look at your growth and everything I'm still freaking out. I've been wanting to go to grad school since middle school (yes, you read correctly) and all the 18 programs I'm applying to are the most competitive programs in the country. I've looked at the incoming class average GPA and have been having nightmares ever since. If the first three semesters don't count I'll have a higher GPA than that crazy high average to be honest and I know applicants from some countries do have higher GPA than us and everything else about me, including standardized tests, are competitive but still. They are THE BEST programs in the country and I think they can afford to care about any tiny aspect of imperfection - not to mention my history is not an imperfection, it's a crack...what if the silly mistakes I've made when I was younger than 18 shatter my opportunities which would have a huge impact on the rest of my life? Really can't start imagining that...
Also, for those who have tried to convince me that I don't need to be in a top program to succeed as a professor, thank you and I get the idea, but I've worked so hard and I just won't and can't accept that the last stop of my education isn't a very prestigious institution. In academia where you get your PhD follows you for life. I want that to be a great school and I will not settle for second-tier."
1925,2014-12-18 20:11:22,"I feel like I've gotten worse at college each semester I've been here. I've gone from making Dean's List, being widely involved, and happy to barely maintaining a 3.0 and seldom going out or participating in student activities.

I feel like most of us here are stressed out during finals week, so much that we constantly play this game of who has more work and harder finals. And I confess that I have been one of those people too. It makes me wonder how many times, I, as well as others, actually cheer each other on and care for each other's well being, when we are so caught up in our own lives. If anything like this happens with a WashU student, I think I will end up convincing myself that it was the school's fault, or the parents who pressured the student, but not me. And that makes me really sad."

I didnt want think about it until after exams but I'm thinking about it all the time now.
1938,2014-12-13 21:54:42,"Without delving into the complexities of the current issues on our campus and around the country and world, I would like to say that I think it's messed up that people change Black Lives Matter to All Lives Matter.  Seriously?  Black people can't have this one thing?  Do white people (and others) feel so left out that they need to insert themselves in?  I understand that all lives matter, and so does everyone else.  No one is saying ONLY black lives matter.

This is a black issue.  Black people are being treated unfairly and unequally and that's the whole point of the movement and protest.  All Lives Matter seems to be a selfish attempt to make it about yourself if you're not black.  It is, at best, completely missing the point, and, at worst, sarcastic and disrespectful.

I believe All Lives Matter is yet another attempt to silence black voices in our country, making it all the more important to assert: Black Lives Matter.

If it matters, I'm white."

I feel like I've been alienated because I don't like to go out very much. I love hanging out with other people, and would go to the parties my friends go to if I could, but I feel it's not a good use of my time or the money that people have given me. I feel like I have an obligation to those that help me to get a good education, and I don't want to disappoint them. I wish I could tell my roommates the truth, but I always just brush it off by saying parties ""are not my thing"". I feel like I'm judged because I don't go to many parties, but there is a lot more to the story than that."

There's only one side. And that's justice. He said he didn't like the racism on campus or in our local community. Why are you all so damn upset about it?

They seemed pleased with my work and I gained a lot of respect for them, in turn. It's all gone after reading an email to a shared colleague.  The email boiled down to statements of how promising the colleague is compared to others in their group (me) and how others in their group have ""chosen their life style"". I'm transgender. Apparently it's something I chose to be. I'm also not promising. I just wish the professor would have been bold enough to say these things to me, instead of in an e-mail to my colleague. Just because you're respected in your field doesn't mean that you have class."

Also, I fear the day that someone else sees me in one of my bad panic attacks.

I agree with posts talking about how mental health and lack of socioeconomic diversity on campus are issues. However, I can't think of a place I would rather be than Wash U. I guess I'm just a freshman, and maybe am oblivious or ignorant to the greater issues at hand, but I can honestly say I had a great semester. I loved my professors, and learned more than I ever thought was possible. I have met so many great people who challenge me every day, and I feel a great sense of community here. Of course Wash U has so much room for improvement, and nobody should stop fighting for that, but I just think we don't give it the credit it deserves. I'm not trying to start anything argument here... just wanted to show some appreciation for what I personally feel is a pretty great place overall, and a place that has begun to feel like home to me."
1953,2014-12-12 20:32:20,I confess that the chansellor's email was the most see-through attempt at trying to show a group of people that he supports them...like seriously? Isn't it your job to be good at showing that you genuinely care about a cause rather than trying to gain support by ambiguously slandering the few places in the world where people can speak freely and have genuine discussions. At least TRY to act like you actually care.
1954,2014-12-12 20:43:21,"I confess that I often feel like unpopular opinions aren't accepted in the Wash U community. As the admin said, the veil of anonymity this page offers is one of the few outlets people may have. And it's important to understand the difference between having an unpopular or minority opinion and having an opinion that's racist, homophobic, etc. That's not what I'm talking about. WashU doesn't have a welcoming outlet for real discussion, just what's politically correct. There's a difference between healthy debate and open dialogue and what so frequently happens on campus. Many of the so called open dialogue events that happen at Wash U represent minorities of race or gender or something but not necessarily minority of opinion. If people don't feel welcome to share all sides of an issue, we won't grow as a community. Think about this: if people with other opinions than your own are afraid to speak their mind, you'll never have the opportunity to change theirs or yours.  Intimidation is not the answer."
1955,2014-12-12 20:41:22,"I think it's ridiculous for the Chancellor to say anything about the devastation of Ferguson at all, considering he sent out a mass email to the community the night the Michael Brown incident occurred. Regardless if it's a civil rights issue or not, we can all agree that that was too early to have any facts about what happened and he has a responsibility as someone who has such a long email list at his disposal to treat his community with care and think about the repercussions of his actions. Instead of reprimanding anyone, HE should be sending out an apology for acting so quickly and irrational. He set a bad example for anyone who wanted to logically and peacefully protest."
1956,2014-12-12 20:39:24,"I came into WashU driven by a curiosity to understand. I'm a senior majoring in science and math working my way through finals and graduate school applications. I probably just bombed some of my finals but honestly I don't give a damn and that scares me. People will probably say ""oh, that's fine, grades don't matter anyway."" Yeah true, but isn't that messed up?

I've done research and I LOVE research. My research group here is amazing and I did an internship over the summer which I loved too. Just because of those experiences, I'm still shooting for a Ph.D and a career in academia. If I had only taken classes or had bad research experiences then I would definitely be going for industry right now. Classes need to be restructured. All they are teaching me is stuff I don't care about because I don't know why the stuff is important. Half of my professors literally lecture straight from the book. I could read the damn book faster than they lecture and finish a semester in 3 weeks. But that should not be the only purpose of classes. I feel like professors are just shoving information down my brain not bothering to explain it's importance or how it relates to work being done today. I get that there are intro classes which will be boring but upper-level classes really should involve some creativity and research.

If the goal of classes is to further an education then just having me memorize some random information is not furthering that goal. I need to understand how that information is useful and what kinds of problems still need to be solved. People should be able to say that grades DO matter because it reflects a real genuine ability to think through problems and solve new ones, not just memorize a couple of methods and then apply them to a very narrow subset of problems that you will see on an exam.

I also tutor here. It scares the hell out of me when people ask questions like ""do I need to know this for the exam?"" or ""can you just tell me what's on the exam?"" because they are missing the point of classes. But I have to confess, I think the same way too and that really scares me....I feel like everyone (professors and tutors included) are missing the point of a real education and that needs to change."
1957,2014-12-12 20:35:25,"I am too quick to judge.

I have seen the complaints here— that we feminists are too judgmental, that we proclaiming ""Black Lives Matter"" are giving people panic attacks, that we liberals are not hearing your calls for dialogue— and I feel sad.

I cannot apologize for those actions. Those are not my actions. But I can apologize for every time I've snapped, raised my voice in an argument, or dismissed someone for their beliefs.

There are reasons; there are vindicating reasons for my nonconstructive actions, and it is important you recognize where I'm fighting from when we disagree— the stakes of an argument about police brutality are much higher for the one being brutalized than the one thinking it's ok, and it's exhausting to constantly fight that battle whether I win or lose. It's hard to be dismissed just because I call myself a ""feminist"" or ""liberal"" or whatever. Sometimes I just need to vent.

But I don't go around trying to hurt others, and if I end up hurting someone I try to apologize. Usually that happens in person, but I'm apologizing here for a reason:

I see people going around with MY labels and choosing to hurt other people. I see people coopting the power of great names and years of struggle to do evil. I see abusers cowering behind the label of feminism, cruel hands gloved in the kindness of religion, rapists and murderers deciding they are ""men's rights activists.""

I want to make it clear:

No label can make you a good person.

There are bad people in this world and it doesn't matter what they call themselves. Feminists who abuse are abusers. Priests who rape are rapists. MRAs who murder are murderers.

This is not a false equivalency. I am not saying MRAs and feminists do evil in equal amounts. I do not believe that is true— I believe MRAs have a lot more listening to do than feminists, and should probably stop suggesting we beat up women.

But that does not mean I should be content with being a feminist.
It does not mean I should be content with my label.

Regardless of who you are, call out shitty people.

Because I know I've been one, plenty of times.

And it would be nice to know, independent of spectrum and affiliation, we are gonna make sure no one gets to be a shitty person for long.

I cannot say that ""this is not what feminists believe"" because those women identify as feminists and they clearly believe in whatever abuse they propagate.

I wanted to emphasize that there are those among us who condemn violence and would be first in line to chew out those abusers, and I think most feminists would fight to join the line as well.

I cannot provide you with proof that's true, but I can provide you with resources.

http://www.aardvarc.org/dv/malevictims.shtml

AARDVARC should be a good starting point if you are seeking help, and any page on domestic violence against women should be able to refer you to a counterpart against men.

Fuck abusers."
1958,2014-12-12 20:29:26,"I did so poorly this semester that I might be failing a course as well as getting put on academic probation and it's absolutely crippling me. I know my problems are so small compared to the grand scheme of things, but it sucks to be held back by your own depression so greatly that you can't excel at the things you used to enjoy. I'm getting help, but I wish I would've done this before I screwed up so hard."
1959,2014-12-12 20:27:28,"When I was younger, if I didn't bring back a good grade (anything above a B), my dad would scream at me so hard that it frightened me. There was even a time when I forgot to bring home an assignment and he beat me with a shoe. After that incident, I became so terrified of the consequences that I was sure never to screw up. My brother who is a middle schooler is in a similar situation, and my dad has even resorted to paddling him on a few occasions.

People may read this and think that it is abuse, but I don't know what to think of it. I realize that he just wants his kids to always be hard working, but then again taking it to his extremes is a totally different story.

I still love my dad, and he hasn't lay a hand on me in years, but sometimes I will just start thinking about these incidents and wondering if it was abuse or not. I don't feel so troubled by it that I would want to go to counseling, but I would like the opinions of certain people before I form my own conclusion about what happened and decide whether or not to seek help."
1960,2014-12-12 20:22:29,"I am disappointed the Chancellor has made it clear that those who are feel the protests are counter-productive to real change are racists. It's upsetting that he nearly throws away the fact that there were two grand jury decisions to not indict. It's disheartening that he chose to side with the hashtag #blacklivesmatter instead of actually promoting #AllLivesMatter.

How many interviews have there been on television where protesters continually claim this isn't about race? They argue it's about a broken legal and governmental system--one of the haves vs. the have-nots. If this were really the case, and things weren't about race, the mantra would be #AllLivesMatter.

Every vine or news clip has shown a diverse group of protesters who were non-Black. Various groups came (and still do) together to support the cause. Where was the public outrage and support from the Black community for the hammer killing of the Bosnian by a group of minorities? Where was the outrage and support from the Black community for the Bosnian woman who was robbed and assaulted by a similar group?

Overall, I'm sad that so much effort is being wasted on marching for change when so few have clearly defined what change they want and how to go about achieving it. The Black community in Ferguson represented in the media made it clear time and time again that they were unhappy with their political representation. How can one fix that? A ~12% turnout in the most recent County elections is disgraceful when, since August, the group has complained of poor representation. This was a starting point in the mission for change and it was lost yet again like it is every year in St. Louis where the Black rate of voting is around 10-13%.

Instead of standing in the streets, blocking traffic, screaming obscenities at local and state law enforcement, there should have been a concerted effort by civil rights leaders and activists to get people registered to vote. Clergy and these groups should have organized resources to help get people to their polling locations or at minimum, tell them where to go and what to expect.

You want change? Hold your local leaders, aldermen, council members and so forth accountable. Go to local city meetings and participate in a respectful and mature manner--not just screaming over the top of people trying to get work done. Screaming ""stop murdering us"" and the like over and over doesn't result in change. It impedes work from getting done. Vote out the elected judges, sheriffs, mayors and alderman. Start contacting your state representatives for your districts and vote them out when they don't represent you. Get involved in your school boards and PTA meetings. Make sure your children are receiving an education that benefits them and improves the likelihood they can succeed in life. Run for local office yourself. The belief that change comes down from the federal level is just a dream. Your more likely to have something take place by affecting change on a local level (and maybe state to a degree).

Yes, all of these things take work. They take far more work and commitment than marching down a sidewalk or  boycotting Walmart. However, these are the things that will actually gain you lasting support from the community at large and will yield real results."
1961,2014-12-12 20:18:32,"What the fuck happened to our school? People are seriously depressed and have really alarming amounts of anxiety. How does Chancellor Wrighton sit back and pat himself on the back for addressing Ferguson while not mentioning a goddam thing about what kids feel like at WashU. I'm not saying he doesn't care, but seriously stand up and say something. I'm just flat-out disappointed. Come on man.

We have three psychiatrists on campus, who are very booked up on appointments, and we don't even have the option of seeing a male doctor for psychiatric treatment if we want to. Aside from depression and anxiety, we have absolutely ZERO discussion about ADHD/LDs, no talk about social anxiety, and no discussion about how tons of people are posting on WashU Confessions about these topics because they don't have anyone to talk to.

This is our community. Kids here clearly need help and as an older student it really upsets me to see that the younger students aren't getting the help they need."
1962,2014-12-12 13:07:34,"ot a lot to say about the Chancellor's comments on Wash U Confessions and Yik Yak, but I'll try to keep this as short as I can. First off, I want to thank the Chancellor for sending out an email and acknowledging the protestors and their efforts. 

But to set the record straight, I reject submissions that are meant to spread racism and hatred. 

I have only been asked a few times to delete a confession because someone didn't like the material in it, and I have responded to every single request. If someone feels like something has slipped through moderation, they can message me and I'll stop what I'm doing to respond to them. It often interrupts my personal life (and that of my significant other), but it's something I have to do because it is my responsibility.

The other day, I asked people to let me know if they had seen any racism or hate speech on this page. The only response I got was from someone who didn't like a protest-related confession about how the protests were making the anonymous submitter racist. I removed that confession and haven't heard about any other confessions that should be removed. 

From what I understand (please let me know if I'm wrong), the hate speech that the Chancellor referred to is on Yik Yak. The posts on this page should not be associated with whatever goes on in Yik Yak just because both are anonymous. 

Either way, it looks like a small number of people have run to the administration to have this page removed or taken down after the Ferguson protest confessions.

This page is meant to be a space for complete honesty, and to provoke conversation that might not otherwise exist. I understand that this doesn't make everyone comfortable, but I really do try to be open and accommodating about how this page is run. I think it is cowardly for someone to try to have the school administration censor or destroy Wash U Confessions simply because they didn't like a confession.

I understand that some of the material on this page may not make everyone comfortable. There are certainly posts pertaining to race and activism, sometimes with controversial viewpoints and opinions, but I filter out anything that I feel supports racism and doesn't encourage constructive dialogue and honesty. 

The Chancellor's email will not change how I run this page. I don't put up submissions that I feel are hate speech or meant to spread racism. If a post offends someone, they can message me and we can work things out. That's what I've done in the past, and that's what I'll continue to do. 

Some people have wondered why there were so many confessions against the protests. The truth is, that's just what people are sending in. I post confessions that I don't agree with because unpopular opinions deserve to be heard too. And without some form of anonymity, those unpopular opinions may be completely suppressed. 

My personal opinions really shouldn't matter, but if people would really like to know, I'll say it. I support the idea of protests against the injustices that we've consistently seen, especially in the past few weeks. Everyone has a different opinion as to what exactly is wrong, but I think it's clear now that SOMETHING is wrong. 

If people sent in confessions supporting the protests in school, I'll put them up, but the problem is that I haven't been getting a lot of those. So if you're really upset about the lack of confessions supporting the protests, please send one in! 

I don't have much else to say right now. If I think of something I forgot to say, maybe I'll update this post. 

And if there's anything that you want to say to me, please don't be afraid to message me. I don't bite!

Good luck on your finals!

1963,2014-12-12 12:12:35,My confessions never get posted and it makes me really sad because I honestly want to know if other people have the same feelings about this school as I do. I feel like Wash U is a terrible place for mental health. I've never had problems with mental health before coming to this school but I feel like the ridiculous levels of stress at this school have brought out the worst in me. And the worst part is I don't think the administration really understands the problem. I cannot think of a single semester at this school that I didn't spend at least half of in absolute misery. The classes here are taught so poorly its hardly worth it to attend. A majority of the professors are by far the least considerate human beings I have ever encountered. (There have been less than a handful of professors who I've legitimately likes and I'm so incredibly thankful for them.) I'm so sick and tired of being graded by impossible standards in my classes. It's absolutely absurd to give exams that your entire class will fail. What does that teach us??? Perhaps this is an Engineering School problem or perhaps this is just me but I honestly hate that I pay $60k every year to attend a school that I hate. I wish I could transfer but I'm far enough into my degree that it would be more of a detriment than a help. Do other people feel this way? Is this a widespread issue?
1964,2014-12-12 12:25:37,"I never have a strong body because of a genetic health problem. But i have never told anyone here how weak my body is.
Every time I go through a physical test, I feel exhausted. When I told someone how I felt today, that person kept giving me reactions like I was making a big deal out of it, and said if I couldn't go through this I could never do (something else).
I just wanna say it is not my fault that my body is not operating in a way i want it to be. And it's tough especially when it's final week. I just want someone to show even a little care, or at least some respect."
1965,2014-12-12 12:28:38,"When I read post #1856, I teared up a bit. I am a senior at WashU, and I was in a similar situation my junior year. My then girlfriend abused me constantly over that time. Originally, it was only slapping, but then she kept on escalating. I started getting bruises. I tried to tell my friends, but I couldn't, not after all the times we all laughed at the idea of women being able to physically abuse men. I didn't want them to think less of me. One time when we were working in the kitchen, I asked my girlfriend if she could finish cooking my egg while I used the bathroom. She said, ""Do you think that women are only here to make men food?"" I said no, but she grabbed the handle of the burning pan and pressed the bottom of the pan against my hand. I knew at the moment that it had gone too far and that I had to end the relationship. A few days later, I ended the relationship by a text message and I have been avoiding her ever since. Thank you author of post #1856 for giving me the courage to speak out."
1966,2014-12-11 00:42:40,"My girlfriend physically abuses me and thinks it's no big deal but I think she's really hypocritical. She's a hardcore feminist and is a WGS major and I just don't get it. She talks in social circles all the time about how abuse is a real issue and then hits me back at my apartment later on the same day. Why? Because she's mad about stuff in her own life. It hurts and there's bruises on my neck because of it. She talks all the time about ""male privilege"" and how women need to be empowered. If this is what she's learning in class, like this is how to feel empowered by hitting me when I'm sitting down at my computer or going to the bathroom, then this WGS program at WashU is horrible."

So a bill comes in the mail for $50,000 and Mom or Dad's like, ""Honey, bring me the checkbook."" How is that even possible?!"
1969,2014-12-11 00:18:43,"I'm going to start off this confession by stating that I am very liberal, very much in support of the protests, and very much in support of fighting systemic racism and injustice in America. I am tired of seeing ignorant and racist posts and comments on my Facebook newsfeed.

However, I do not agree with how these issues have been handled on campus, and especially on Wash U Confessions recently. Right now, we are not fostering an environment for open discussion or cooperation, which is what we need now more than ever. At a school like Wash U, where every person is intelligent and has thoughts and ideas, I believe that it is absolutely unacceptable to shut down the opinion of any single student without first giving them a chance.

I fully believe that people can be against the protests, and even in favor of Darren Wilson, police, etc., without necessarily being racist. While I strongly disagree with them, I will never immediately label or judge someone for their opinion without hearing their reasoning first. Not understanding where someone is coming from GOES BOTH WAYS. It is unfair to not hear someone out NO MATTER WHICH SIDE THEY ARE COMING FROM.

I am proud of our community for creating such a sense of activism on campus, but so disappointed and fed up with the way that many students act toward anyone who doesn't immediately or outwardly agree with them.

And now watch me promptly be attacked for even daring to post this."

Sometimes I end up changing my mind, and sometimes it helps me strengthen what I believe in. Most of my liberal friends have never even HEARD a conservative idea, except for whatever bullshit they hear from the media. I'm not saying they have to agree with me, I just think that it would be good for them to know WHY they believe what they believe and be able to express it beyond just major talking points.

1975,2014-12-10 16:11:55,I confess that I must thank Chancellor Wrighton for letting the faculty know about WU confessions. I've never laughed so hard and now see my students in a whole new light!
1976,2014-12-10 16:39:56,"I confess that I find it hypocritical that Chancellor Wrighton said ""we have fallen short in creating an environment where everyone feels respected, honored and safe"" and condemns people for posting anonymously in Yik-Yak and Wash U Confessions in the same letter. His exact words said something about people using anonymity to use racist, bigoted words, but I haven't seen that at all, especially on Wash U Confessions. I'm sorry that not everyone supports the Ferguson protests, but that doesn't make everyone who disagrees with the movement racist. Am I the only one who has never seen anything on Yik Yak or Wash U Confessions that has been racist? Or at least that hasn't been immediately down-voted if it was? I find it very disappointing that Wrighton doesn't recognize that students are SCARED to share their opinion because of one reason or another on campus. I find it disappointing that the head of our university has taken a side on the issue, making it even more difficult for me to openly share my opinions. Most importantly, I find it disappointing that any opposition to the Ferguson movement has, as solidified by Wrighton's letter, been labeled as racist.

I always hear. ""Attach your words to your name."" That's easy enough for you to say; you don't have to face ostracism or labeling because the public agrees with you. I genuinely fear that I could lose a job opportunity if I posted some of my ideas openly. I don't feel like I can have an open discussion about this; I feel like none of the leaders of the movement want to hear people with different ideas than them."

Though I dumped the person I moved on with because they weren't for me either. I've never had so many guys want to go out with me at once. I'm really good at catching men now, because after losing a relationship that was supposed to last the rest of my life, I just don't care about rejection. So I date people. I strike up conversations. I go for it, and it almost always works out. The problem is I can't talk to man without assuming every word coming out of their mouth is a pack of lies. I'm not sure if I'll ever be in love again. I'm scared to be in the same situation I was before when I was being unappreciated and abused. I'm not looking for a relationship. I'm not looking for anything. I love the game; I've gotten really good at it. But I just don't care. I walk away easily. What's wrong with me?

I guess it just frustrates me that there's such a huge emphasis on not triggering people here because it's become so much a joke that it's hard for me to share with the people close to me about what does trigger me. I'm not saying that we should be blatantly insensitive, but I think it's important to remember that everyone has been through pain and no one person's is more important than another's."

I struggled with a couple of problems this semester including being alone for way too much of time, not being able to get out of bed/home and do my work, etc. I was not in good shape when I met with my dad during Thanksgiving, but I thought he couldn't tell (I didn't really talk to my parents about those issues) so I pretended that nothing happened, but he actually telled. We had a really deep conversation before I went back to school, and I really feel better right now, which is good. Also, this semester is gonna end and I feel I could put all those shitty memories away, put myself together during winter break and start fresh next semester.

So my question is, how could I better adjust myself for school during winter break? I know it sounds rather ridiculous, but I had hoped to start fresh every semester, and haven't succeeded. I have serious procrastination and it's worsening semester after semester, and worst of all, I have less and less friends. I just want to get some advice without forcing myself actually seeking professional help or something. I'm not going back home during winter break, and I'm considering adjusting my sleep schedule, working out and maybe trying to study a little for the materials next semester. And other suggestions?"

And it is now that I'm finally ready to admit that my parents physically abused me as a child. They stopped when I was 13 and since then pretended it never even happened, but only now am I beginning to really feel the pain of what happened. I am so ashamed and I don't feel like I can talk to anyone about this because I'm afraid they'll judge me and my parents. I still love them but am struggling to come to terms with how horribly they treated me when I was younger. I feel like this is weird and if I tell anyone they'll think less of me if I decide not to disown my parents or still have a close relationship with them. I don't know what to do, I feel like I have so many emotions that I have no release for and often find myself crying for no reason. Does anyone have any suggestions?"
1985,2014-12-08 21:47:22,"I really hate it when everyone thinks that I'm one of those who would be mad over a B, is super conscientious, super organized, and really into studying and getting good grades. I know as a fact that many of the people who think that way have better grades than I do and handle life much better than I do. Although I do think grades are important I can't be further away from putting it to supreme importance. I've gotten a C, a D+ and even failed a class during my Wash U career and only pulled my GPA back to a decent level after three semesters' crazy hard work. I am even having trouble talk about my past grades with my recommenders because ""you just do not seem like someone who has not done well"". Every single time I see/hear such perceptions I cannot help but wondering whether it's because I'm Asian, I'm super fat and unattractive or I'm just plain socially awkward.

I know that there is a pretty decent sized LGBT presence on campus, but I don't feel that I have anything in common with them. I don't mind being gay, and I am completely at peace with it, but at the same time I don't identify with the mainstream gay scene/culture or the gay pride movement. I just feel like a regular person and being gay is part of that.

I watch / play sports, I'm into cars, and I have much more in common with most straight people than gay people, at least those that I've met here. I'm a stereotypical ""jock"" type of guy and people are almost always surprised when I come out to them. I have a lot of close straight male friends and am socially well adjusted, but I sometimes feel alone because I can't seem to find anyone else that's like me.

I'm attracted to guys that are also ""stereotypically masculine"" and I can't seem to find any of them. It would even be nice to have a gay friend that has a ""stereotypically straight"" sensibility and interests like me. I've met a handful of gay guys here and I honestly just couldn't see myself being friends with any of them. I have nothing against them, it's just that we're not similar at all. Please forgive me if this comes off as generalizing or homophobic - I'm really just trying to be as honest as I can.

It's harder to meet people like me because they're less present on campus, if they exist, and they don't make as big of a deal about being gay. A lot of them probably aren't even out. I don't really know why I'm writing this post or what I expect to get from it, but I guess it feels good to vent my frustrations. Aiight, you can go back to studying or getting high or whatever now"

2)  BD dining service money would shoot through the roof.  BD would make so much freaking money they would prob be able to invest some of that into another scholarship or something.  Or maybe even lower their exorbitantly high prices....
3) Our student populace might actually be a lot happier and nicer.  I know i'm both when I'm high.  Also it'd be SUPER progressive ya know? and Wash U should be progressing right instead of staying flagnant and the same.

ALSO its kinda douchey to say its relatively ok and we'll put a blind eye to underage intoxciation which can cause crazy damage to your kidneys and make you more likely to do stupid shit and then be like ""weed is bad for you and illegal mmmmk?"" when it's not and helps glaucoma and cancer.

Then I heard the girl arguing with the guy over the appropriateness of a fairly sex-heavy TV show he had watched for a class assignment, and shortly afterward I overheard the guy talking with a few of his other friends about how there were things he wanted to try (like drinking) that she would never let him do. Coming from a household myself where my mom was very demanding and my dad was a bit of a pushover but didn't quite agree with her on everything, I felt sorry for their future kids and really wanted to talk to them about their compatibility with each other, but I felt too afraid to do so (mostly because arguments about such things are mildly triggering for me due to how they turned out with my parents when I was a kid).

1997,2014-12-05 23:15:41,"A message to the student organizers of Wash U's protests:

Thank you for all of the time, effort, and emotion you have put into leading the campus's efforts to stand in solidarity and fight for racial equality. I admire your bold action to stand in front of hundreds of students and make a statement to push for a just system. I have participated in multiple rallies that you have organized and believe in their power to express solidarity, empower those feeling the impact of recent events and their long-lasting history, and advocate for change.

This post's purpose is two-fold. (1) Thank you for your action and encouragement and (2) request that more information be provided as to the intended course of action at Action events.

The most recent protest, on December 4, made me question my involvement in Wash U's protests. Some students who participated in the protest and avidly believe in its intent felt pressured to follow the crowd at the protest when it moved off course from the expressed plan. Some students were uncomfortable entering the library, others were uncomfortable with moving to upper floors. Some students felt pressure walking through the street and others did not want to stand in the intersection at Forsyth and Skinker.

Many students' involvement in protests is beyond their comfort zone, questioned by family members, or disapproved of by friends. It is vital that we encourage involvement in protests rather than push supporters away. Yes, this is an issue that you may believe is worthy of blocking intersections and taking a stance in the library. But it is critical that we recognize that not every student feels the same way and we do not want to lose allies by pushing people beyond their limits without warning. It is difficult to make in the moment decisions. While no one forced students to continue participating, the pressure of the moment caused involvement that many students did not want to have. I simply request that the intended or potential course of action of each protest is clear so that each individual can decide their involvement.

Thank you again for your leadership, support, and action.

P.S.: Is there a form through which members of the student body can contact you with concerns, suggestions, or requests for further involvement?  This seemed like the best way to make contact."
1998,2014-12-05 23:03:42,"I confess that I think I'm developing some serious health problems. I sometimes try to tell myself that it isn't as bad as it seems and that my symptoms aren't severe enough to even be diagnosed, but there are times when I just sit and cry in frustration or fear. I would never hurt myself (out of love for my parents, really), but I think about what would happen if I did. Sometimes it feels like I should be blaming my ""friends,"" who leave me out of basically any and all plans and don't seem concerned about me at all. My roommate basically doesn't live here anymore, either, and I'm starting to think it may be personal. And then sometimes I get angry with myself for being this way or for feeling too guilty or scared to speak up. Like this is something I want or can control. But it's not. And it's not anyone's fault, either.

I mean, I know nobody can do anything for me after reading this post. But I want everyone to really think about how their actions impact the people they care about. Please pay attention to your friends. Maybe my friends don't event realize that what they're doing is really taking a toll on my mental health. Maybe they've never noticed my symptoms. But come on: nobody gets 500 extra meal points by eating three meals a day. And I don't do much to hide my depression. I spend way too much time alone, though, because I'd feel awkward hanging around with people when I wasn't invited so they clearly don't want me there. I think being alone is what's really getting to me.

I'm not sure whether I want people to notice and help or to simply acknowledge the fact that they're not being particularly good friends. And I know I can't fix my depression or my possible eating disorder on my own. So I guess all I'm hoping by writing this post is that people will be more aware of what their friends are going through, whether they play a role in it or not."

I don't know what to do. I know how extremely serious depression and anxiety disorders are and I don't want to trivialize them because I don't think I exhibit symptoms anywhere near the magnitude of a mood disorder. As a result, I'm reluctant to ask for professional help or even to use a service like Uncle Joe's because maybe I'm simply being dramatic. I'm not even sure what, exactly, I expected from submitting this confession. It's just that if I went to bed one day and never woke up and never had to deal with the fact that I might legitimately fail one of my classes this semester and that I'm pretty sure all my friends actually hate me, I'd be fine. And that thought scares me.

I guess my confession is that I wish that I had just one real friend here who I could actually talk to. I also wish that people could stop studying for just two minutes and realize how much everyone around them is struggling too."
2002,2014-12-05 18:07:49,"I'm sure there will be an abundance of confessions with regards to the protest in Olin today, but please, I beg you, read this and consider what I am saying. I apologize for the length.

I was working at the library when the protesters came storming in, with drums and screaming; there seemed to be about 400 people in the crowd. I tried to hold on as long as I could, hoping it would go away soon, but it became too much. I ran (getting pushed down by a protester without even a glance my way or an apology) into the girl's bathroom and fell down to my knees in a fit of panic in one of the stalls. I was having a panic attack, induced by the crowd of protesters. I spent 20 minutes in the fetal position on the bathroom stall floor, tears running down my face.

Now many of you probably do not know what a panic attack is. Have you ever felt like someone had their hands on your neck, choking you? Have you ever felt what it feels like to drown? With panic attacks, most people cannot breathe. I physically couldn't breathe - I was alternately hyperventilating and choking. My entire body was shaking. And the phrase ""I'm dying, I'm dying, please help me,"" was running through my head over and over again like a broken soundtrack.

Three or four women came into the bathroom and they could hear me. One whispered to her friend about ""crazy crying bitches"" and the other one came in later, and although my panic attack and pleas for help were clearly heard, she said nothing and left.

I fully support the protests going on, and I saw the Facebook event about the one today. But I had no idea it would be in the library, where I was. The whole point of the protest is to fight for the rights of every single person, and yet as a person myself, no one bothered to help me. I was alone.

Quite frankly, I am upset that I (along with most everyone else) was unaware that the protest would occur in the library. I feel that it was inconsiderate, because no one stopped to think - a library is a quiet place, where many students like me come to so that we can avoid riots and protests and large crowds, the things that trigger us to have panic attacks. I have a friend who tutors autistic children in the library - what would have happened if they were there? And at least 5 people saw or heard me in the midst of my panic attack, and no one cared enough to ask me if I was okay or needed help."
2003,2014-12-05 18:27:52,"I confess that I am tired.

I am tired of all this hate. Everywhere I turn, it seems someone is lashing out at another for their views, calling them ""dumb"" or ""misguided"" or ""idiotic."" Everywhere I turn, it seems someone is touting off how another view is evil or wrong. In the name of ""love"" for mankind, they spread hate.

I am tired of all this hypocrisy. Here we stand, watching as people march around, crying out against inequality. Here we stand, letting some of these same people ensure that we can never be equal, because they only deepen the divisions among us. In the name of tolerance, they bitterly spread intolerance.

I am tired of all this division. We divvy ourselves up by our race, by our political views. We make ourselves vulnerable to the predators who thrive in these splits, who find power and fame and fortune in our refusal to set aside our differences, and who struggle to make sure that we will never overcome our barriers and therefore destroy their ""valiant"" success in the fight for ""social equality.""

I am tired of the double standards. I am tired of the false dichotomies. I am tired of the immense, overwhelming sense of pride that some people feel the need to not only exercise but also to shove down our throats as they boast in their alleged superiority, explaining in such elaborate and venom-soaked detail why they are right and you are wrong.

We stand as some of the brightest, most accomplished, most privileged people in all of history. We--not just here at Wash U but all over the USA--are the world's greatest chance to make tomorrow better. But we can not, we will not, because we are stuck squabbling with each other.

 I don't care if you're black or white or any other race. I don't care if you're a Democrat or a Republican. I don't care if you're an atheist or a Christian or a Muslim or a Jew. All I care about is whether you're going to be the problem or the solution. And if your actions support the division, and hatred, and hypocrisy, and so many other problems that run rampant in this country, then you are part of the problem.

Yeah, this is offensive. It's time we get offended. Yeah, this is uncomfortable. It's time we get uncomfortable. If we can't change, then we will never be able to cause real change. We've spent decades chasing the wrong people, the wrong problems because we cannot overcome our problems. And I am tired of it. I'm tired of it all. I'm ready for change."

The reason I quit the Social Justice center is this: they come in, claim they care about events in the community (read: Ferguson), say that they are fighting to improve these communities, and yet they absolutely shit on the lovely staff here. Seriously, I can't stand that groups that claim to care so much about the events in Ferguson (I even recognized a few from the live broadcasts the night they released the decision) can't be bothered to care about the staff here, many of whom live and work in Ferguson and the surrounding neighborhoods. I stayed here over Thanksgiving break and opened up my dorms to two of the workers at BD because they were legitimately afraid about getting home safely, and that should mean more than sitting in a circle discussing high-minded rhetoric that won't change. Please guys, be honest with yourselves and don't make aggrandized claims about the difference you're making with your advocacy when the only real difference is the extra work added to what the janitoral staff do every night.

2013,2014-12-02 05:00:20,"I understand that this is not really an 'Ask Wash U' page, but I would like to post this to get more ideas from the Wash U Community.

I just came out of the closet to my mother and she is not pleased with me at all. She thinks I am deliberately trying to make her unhappy and that I could have chosen to be straight. I am now given some time to ""change"", but I know that's never going to happen. However, my mother doesn't and I'd like to know of different ways to approach this conversation. It's not that I don't know what to say, but I'd like your help on how to talk to my mom so that she can reach a state of understanding. Ultimately, I do know I am not asking for permission; I am asking for acceptance.

Please help me out! Thank you!!"

The overwhelming attitude on ANY given issue is: ""If you're not with me, then you're against me.""

It kind of shuts down the dialogue.

I want to talk to my peers about these issues. I want to engage and hear from different perspectives. That's why I came to college, but people of differing viewpoints are so often criminalized by their opponents.

I have seen so many people shot down by their classmates for daring to proffer an unpopular opinion. So I keep my mouth shut."

Since I've come to Wash U, people have started to compliment me on my clothes and appearance, and it feels so fucking amazing. It's so difficult to have problems with body positivity and self-consciousness, and I'm so grateful for all the people who took a few seconds out of their day to tell me they like my hair or shirt.

2025,2014-11-29 13:31:38,"I confess that I hate all those international applicants. Don't get me wrong: I have no problem with anyone holding any passport. I am not a chauvinist or something. The problem is, I am an Asian, and all those international applicants are pushing the bar super high for us. I am not in math or science - my major has an average GRE Math of below 160 even for top schools, but as an Asian no one thinks I'm impressive even after I've gotten a perfect 170. Same thing for GPA. I really don't know how those universities grade their students but it seems that every one of them has a 3.9. And then most of them have limited research experience, mediocre rec letters, and most importantly, can't write or speak in comprehensible English - something that is vital for my field. So most of them are not getting in, and most of those who get in are qualified students - I have no problem of admitting them. However the legacy those unqualified students leaves is that year after year we Asians are being held to a higher standard than anyone else gradewise in applications. It's not official research  - I mean who would release this sort of data it's arguably discrimination - but really Asian students need to score a lot higher than everyone else to be considered equally good as everyone else.
This is unfair. This is hurting us. We struggled as much as everyone else in every class to accomplish whatever we have accomplished. People tease us as nerds, as unattractive, as socially awkward, but after we join student groups, frats/sororities, volunteer causes and thus spent less (i.e. and then equal to everyone else's) amount studying, we are punished for getting worse (comparing to what they have used to and comparing to those international students who really do not have as big a pressure to social) grades. What should we do?"
2026,2014-11-29 13:08:40,I confess that I maybe homeless soon and I'm more than concerned. My family has gone through a lot in the past few months and there are many people staying with my mother right now. She asked me could I stay at school for a bit during winter break and I mistakenly told her yes because I assumed it wouldn't be a problem. I didn't know that Wash U charges you $50 a night to do so. My mother isn't a doctor or a lawyer and we don't have that kind of money. I don't want to take this to my mom because she has enough on her plate without me taking back promises. Is there anyone here I can talk to about staying in my dorm for a bit longer and possibly coming back early?

2030,2014-11-29 01:25:45,"To err is human, and I must confess that I am very human. I have made many mistakes throughout my life, but none more serious than deciding to break up with my girlfriend earlier this year. I finally found someone who cared for me, made me happy, encouraged me, praised me, and always wanted the best for me. And then I made an extremely hasty decision, and lost all of that. It didn't take long for me to start regretting my decision. I have absolutely no idea what I was thinking breaking up with the one girl I have ever loved. I have tried so hard to get over it. I have tried to talk other girls, and it just feels so wrong. And I have to confess that I just cannot get over it. I honestly have no idea what to do. I love this girl and care for her so much, and yet I was the one to foolishly break up with her. I think about her all the time, and basically cry myself to sleep every night. And the worst part of this whole thing is that I know I did this. It is my own damn fault. I hurt her by breaking up with her, and knowing that I did that to her absolutely kills me on the inside. I would get back together with her in a heartbeat, but I'm afraid that I will never be able to win her back. Seeing her talk and flirt with other guys feels like someone is repeatedly stabbing me in the heart. And that someone is me, because I know that I did this to myself. I can't open a book or turn on the TV or leave my house without thinking about her. I see her in everything I do, and I can't ever get her out of my head. What am I supposed to do?"
2031,2014-11-24 15:09:48,I am a recent WashU graduate and I felt so much pressure to do something after college that I just applied for jobs I thought I could get without any consideration for what I wanted to do. And now I regret taking the first job offer I got instead of working harder to do something I was truly interested in or taking a chance and waiting to hear from other places.
2032,2014-11-24 14:06:49,"I confess that it is disgusting when people drink in class. Last week in my [---------] class I had to sit next to someone who was smelling like alcohol and cigarettes at the same time, at 2 in the afternoon. This isn't what we came to this school for."
2033,2014-11-24 03:17:52,"I confess I hold a very popular opinion: I am black and I do not support the Ferguson movement. As more and more evidence is released it really is starting to look like Darren Wilson was acting in self defense. I know we'll never know exactly what happened, but if the grand jury decides not to charge Wilson with a crime I don't believe it's because of racism or a system of oppression, but because they have carefully considered the evidence and have made the best decision they could. No doubt the jury knows the enormous consequences of their decision and are trying to do the best they can.

Don't get me wrong: it's not that I don't sympathize with Michael Brown's family or the people of Ferguson. I feel terrible for his family: no parents should have to go through what they have. And it's not that I don't believe things need to change because clearly they do. I just don't think Wilson shooting Brown is indicative of systematic racism. I've seen some of these issues firsthand (I grew up in an area that, although not as bad as Ferguson, wasn't all that nice either) and I think the bigger problems are the poverty, broken homes, and poor education systems that contribute to the crime rate in neighborhoods like Ferguson. I don't hate the cops for trying the best they can in really crappy circumstances.

I think it's a shame that this whole situation probably won't result in any meaningful change. I mean, yeah they might institute some better training programs for the police officers or increase the percentage of black officers or something, but at the end of the day those underlying problems will still be there. And even though most of the protesters will be peaceful, some people are still going to use this as an excuse to attack cops or loot stores (which, ironically, are usually the businesses of the people they say they are helping.)

I guess that I'm trying to say is: Ferguson needs change, but this is not the way and Michael Brown should not be their martyr. I just don't feel like I can express this opinion anywhere else."
2034,2014-11-24 03:36:53,"I'm intimidated by the WashU feminist Facebook group sometimes. I enjoy reading what people post. I really appreciate how a lot of current events relevant to my interests - legislation regarding LGBT rights, or Planned Parenthood, or Polish towns banning Winnie the Pooh for being inappropriate for children - are posted to the page, and I appreciate the occasional article that teaches me something new (for instance, that there are towns out there that for some crazy reason feel that Winnie the Pooh's lack of pants results in a problematic gender identity).

But whenever I want to post something to the page, I get really nervous.  There's been instances when someone makes an irreverent comment, and they get immediately jumped on for being insensitive. Or someone asks ""what does this even have to do with feminism?"" in a pretty rude way.

Heck, there's been like forty articles posted where I really want to say ""I can't believe it's not Onion"" and I'm too nervous to bust out that line because I'm worried someone will find it hurtful somehow.  It sometimes feels like you can't play in the game unless you know all the rules.

I still love the FB group as an educational tool. I just wish I was more comfortable participating."

2036,2014-11-23 21:45:56,"I confess that I hate living with my roommate because he makes me feel bad about myself. We' be become really close, so we talk all the time, and he's definitely the best friend I've made in college. He went to one of the top schools in the country and I'm the only one from my high school to ever come to WashU. We're in the same major, so we have a couple of the same classes, and he does half the work I do but outperforms me on all the exams and homework assignments. We've both joined quite a few clubs and organizations, but mine aren't really conducive to a social environment outside of the meetings, so my only party source is him and his friends. They're nice and all, but I feel like they just see me as his roommate and not an actual person they want to know and befriend. He's just like basically flawless and then here I am, sitting at home on my butt because I feel bad for always accepting his invitations to go out to his events and never having any of my own. I'm really glad I made this friend, but sometimes I wish he weren't so goddamned perfect so I wouldn't feel bad about myself."
2037,2014-11-23 03:11:57,"I confess that I'm pretty sure I'm some form of alcoholic. Does anyone know of a good resource that isn't SHS but is also covered by WashU insurance? I went to SHS for my depression. I'm suspicious that their uselessness led to my alcoholism.

I don't expect you to care. I don't expect anything of anybody. I just hope someone understands how tough this is, even if they don't have an answer to my question."
2038,2014-11-22 19:03:58,"I confess that I don't even consider myself smart and capable anymore. Being surrounded by such bright peers is a privilege and I admire everyone's achievements, but it is also deeply intimidating. I try not to compare myself, but I am barely involved on campus, not particularly social, and just slave away simply to save face academically. I just haven't been beating the curves recently and as a result, put myself down. I wish I could be a bigger fish in a small pond. While I'm grateful for all the fantastic resources this university offers, I feel coursework is too demanding for me to take advantage. I'm graduating in the spring and feel my college experience is largely incomplete and that I haven't really grown during these four years due to academic obligations.  Every day, I criticize myself for subscribing to a system and a school that is so challenging and stressful, it's harmful to my health and personal development. This isn't the first time I've asked myself if the fancy degree is worth it, but it is the first time I'm starting to think not."
2039,2014-11-22 17:54:11,"I understand the need for WashU to build newer and nicer housing, but it's too expensive and puts students who aren't as well off at a disadvantage. The Lofts are super nice and all, but it's not fair that so many students were forced to live there even though they couldn't afford to. And maybe instead replacing traditional dorms with modern suite-style dorms, they could build new ""traditional style dorms"" for students who want to save money. Issues like this only contribute to the lack of socioeconomic diversity at WashU"
2040,2014-11-22 17:32:12,"I have started doubting my attractiveness to telling myself that I'm unattractive and that I should just get over it. Honestly, don't know which is worse.

2041,2014-11-22 14:51:14,"You know its a little thing, but it kind of sucks to be a senior and never have received a Wash U Admirer's post.

2042,2014-11-21 17:39:15,"I know that there are a lot of problems at Wash U, and that some people are unhappy, but I really have to say that these three years have been some of the best years of my life. I came into college not wanting to join a sorority, and luckily I found a close group of friends who also wanted to stay independent. I am so grateful to have friends who are there when I need them. But I am also grateful for the people I see around campus who are extraordinarily friendly and smile at me when I'm having a bad day. Thanks to all who make Wash U so amazing!"

2044,2014-11-21 10:12:21,"Every day, I spend hours perusing through Facebook and liking the old photos and statuses of my RAs and WUSAs. It's all I do in my free time, and I get so much self-gratification for it. Recently, several WUSAs of the dorm (other floors) decided to social-network-exile me from their lives by blocking me. I feel so sad and lonely. I'm pretty shy and awkward in person, so I express my friendliness through social media. Please unblock me."
2045,2014-11-21 02:32:22,"I don't join the Society of Women Engineers because I think the way to raise the position of women in engineering is to integrate them into co-ed engineering groups. Segregation is not the answer.
But now I think prospective employers look at my resume and judge me for not joining SWE."
2046,2014-11-21 02:07:24,"I didn't rush freshman year because I wasn't ready and sophomore year I was hoping to make RA (I didn't). Now, as  a Junior I know it wouldn't be socially acceptable to rush and I probably wouldn't get in the sorority I want, but I feel like I'm missing out on a college experience that I'll never be able to do again."
2047,2014-11-21 02:39:25,I lost my virginity in a Wecar
2048,2014-11-21 02:27:26,I confess that last year I was raped and couldn't bring myself to call it that until right now. I was blackout drunk when a boy took me back to his apartment and when I came to we were hooking up and I was mortified. I didn't know this boy at all and definitely did not consent to what we were doing. I immediately left only to find out I had no idea where I was and had to have someone come find me. I know everyone on this campus jokes about consent but it's not funny. You may not realize that someone is blackout but you can definitely tell when someone is too drunk. We all need to take responsibility to make sure no one guy or girl has to go through this.
2049,2014-11-21 02:37:28,"So I've been going to hella social justice things this semester and I decided to research gender and I think I may be gender queer? I realized that I don't reeallly believe in gender. Then it hit me that I don't feel like a dude. I used to identify as male but now it just doesn't feel right. Am I defining gender queer right? Do I have to come out as gender queer? I don't really like the whole ""they/them or zee/zir"" thing but he/him just doesn't seem to fit. I think I'll stick to he/him only because it's easier but idk. I don't think I should go to Pride or something because this isn't a gay/straight thing. Anyone have thoughts because I'm at a loss."
2050,2014-11-20 19:12:29,"I confess that I'm both thrilled and terrified for sorority recruitment.  I feel like so much is riding on it; even though I love WashU, I haven't met people I feel really close to or people who make me really happy.  I've been counting on the fact that going Greek will introduce me to lifelong friends and an actual social life, but now I'm worried that I won't get into a sorority I want to be in, or even just not get into one at all.
If I'm not incredibly happy with being in a sorority, I'll wonder if I made the right choice by coming here.  I just don't know how else to find a close group of friends."
2051,2014-11-20 19:27:32,I confess that I am a virgin because I am too scared to show anybody my penis.  My first girlfriend in high school wouldn't even let me take off my pants because she was scared of how big it was.  Nobody will even put it in their mouth because of its size and now I'm just terrified to even let anybody see it.  I feel like a freak of nature that nobody will have sex with.
2052,2014-11-20 17:18:34,"Is there somewhere we could donate to thank you for all of your efforts for keeping the page afloat? I know that it must be a lot of hard work to bear the burden for this page, and if there's any way that I, or other students, could help compensate, please let us know!"
2053,2014-11-20 17:09:35,I really love one of my friends but he's so cocky about his grades that I have to restrain myself from losing it.
2054,2014-11-20 17:57:37,"I confess that the white shaming and ""check your privilege"" attitude on campus (plus what I've seen on this confessions page) have made me a little paranoid. I kind of get the feeling that most non-white students here at Wash U assume I'm racist before they even know anything about me. Which, when you think about it, is kind of racist in itself, isn't it? And it's the opposite of what they're trying to promote so it's not really helping anyone."
2055,2014-11-20 17:47:38,"I confess that I have relapsed into my eating disorder, and that I'm scared to let anyone know because Wash U is still new to me, and I don't really have any friends yet. I don't know where to go for help, or who will not judge me. This place makes me feel crazy and helpless.  I'm scared to tell some one, but I'm scared about what will happen if I don't."
2056,2014-11-20 17:33:40,"Let me lay out some of the issues I have with ""SJWs"" (for lack of a better term). I'm a minority, and it greatly annoys me when people feel as though they have the right to speak for all ""oppressed people"" as if minorities are some sort of monolithic block. I've never really experienced any kind of discrimination (it's possible that I have and didn't think about it I suppose, but even so I can't say it's really had any tangible impact on my life) and when activists say things like # yesallblackpeople and # yesallwomen (full disclosure, I'm a man), I'm just like...did you really talk to every minority and every woman? I know that there are an abundance of ""oppressed group"" members who very strongly disagree with you. Why would you presume to speak on my behalf when you don't know anything about me or my experiences?

I certainly don't want to diminish those who have indeed experienced racism or discrimination. I think there's a way to talk about the problems in our society without arbitrarily putting people into categories. I wish SJWs would recognise the diversity of thought and experience that exists among minorities."
2057,2014-11-20 17:13:41,"I'm having trouble writing this right now, because of a general sense of numbness throughout my body and slight trembling. I just had what I can describe as my first mental breakdown, and it was so horrifying, I can't believe I was capable of bottling up all of that emotion, which erupted rather horribly, where I had convulsions, laughing fits, mind-numbing screams in bouts of 15 minutes, and when I thought the agony subsided, it came back again, and I could no longer breath normally, and felt like I had to fight for air. I thought I had mental breakdowns before, but this was something else. Whenever I thought about my current laughable situation, the hurricane of jumbled up emotions just exacerbated. I have a slight pain in my chest even now and am hyperventilating. I feel like I re-enacted the horrible transformation of a super-villain, with the uncontrollable roars, groans, jumping and cackling, which ironically arose from pure desperation and pain, combined with the simultaneous crying and total loss of self control. All of my life passed through my eyes, and the bleakness of my current situation triggered another spoilt tantrum etc. etc.

Halfway through, I thought I was an undeserving loony, as I was doing everything I'd seen mentally ill people do in the media. I was like Dr. Jekyll turning into Mr. Hyde, and I welcomed the newly found derangement as the change that I had been longing. Observing my physical and mental reactions were interesting, and one time my breakdown was interrupted with me thinking about the power of the nervous system and human physiology and its capabilities. But I was overwhelmed with emotion again, when I realized my journey of knowledge to what I loved was fraught with insurmountable odds, and I thought how unfair that was, and continued to bawl like a baby.

I thought, if I'm having breakdowns like this, because of a fear for the future, stress, constant feeling of inferiority, under-performing in classes, and missed deadlines, kudos to everyone who goes through much worse and manages just well, still perseveres and lives on. I thought I was strong, but I wish I had the strength of those people and I hope the best for them. I don't think anyone should go through the suffering some people experience. I've stated this before, but this was really mind-boggling, as if someone was torturing me physically as well. And when I thought about how many years, I had to live still, and how many more agonies I had to bear, I wished I had a heart-attack and curled up and died right then and there. I can't imagine how the unfortunate people of history endured what they did. And I do feel lucky that I don't go through that kind of physical torture.

I think I'm currently enjoying the high of having come out of that decrepit state, in which I crawled on the floor and hugged the refrigerator among all of the other things I described. I wish this could last, but I fear this might become a trend now. It was really relaxing, in retrospect, though I felt like I was dying at the time. However, I did want to die at the time, and lived the wonderful juxtaposition of trying to strangle myself, and breathing deeply, because I thought the air I was getting was no longer enough with the severe heart palpitations.

The more I think of the work I have ahead of me, and my inabilities, the more I feel like a fish struggling for air, and I feel like I'm losing my mental balance.

So in the end what I want to say is: I thought I could sympathize with people going through extreme pain before, as I had also felt sad and thought I was possibly depressed. But what I just experienced about an hour ago far exceeds the threshold of mental pain, desperation and hopelessness I thought one could experience. If hell does exist, I imagine it can't be any worse than this. But then again, there is probably even worse things I haven't experienced yet."
2058,2014-11-20 17:59:42,"I confess that I feel like people judge me upon first sight at this campus. It's not because I'm a minority group, or my gender, or anything eccentric, it's because of my weight.

I have felt self-conscious getting food so many times on campus that I've lost track. I try to eat healthy and people are in complete shock that an overweight person even knows what spinach and kale are and if I eat unhealthily people think I'm gorging myself into oblivion. I even took it upon myself to try and work out at the AC and I felt like everyone there was either trying to not get caught looking at me or scoffing at me.

I honestly feel like I can't win and I already have fairly low self-confidence. On one hand I don't want to let the negativity get to me and on the other hand, it's hard not to."

It's horrible and I'd honestly hope that this post doesn't get any likes, but I truly do want this to go away for him. This is hurting me so much but I feel like I can't be the only one. I don't know why I'm so hurt like this."

They tell people the proper way to think and feel and then call those people racists, bigots, et cetera if they don't share their rather binary and divisive worldview of oppressors and oppressed. Stop lumping people into different groups and telling them how to feel and you might get a better response."
2062,2014-11-20 00:09:49,"Up to this day I still think that there are huge accent discrimination here but no one admits to that. While being Black might bring problem when people just look at you, having a foreign accent will bring a lot more subtle and unconscious discriminations even in justice-aware environments like here. And apparently no one cares. Even for groups which explicitly want diversity discrimination still happens. Asian American cannot represent Asian international students. Same for other racial groups. People make so many condescending remarks that they don't even realize sounds bad. I guess most of us would not approve saying something like ""This is really good work for a female"" or ""this is awesome work for a black student"", but why are people saying things like that to international students EVERY SINGLE DAY and think that it's praise and we should smile and say ""thank you"" and think we are crazy when we are angry at such statements?"
2063,2014-11-20 00:56:52,"I confess that I read into social situations way too much and it causes me a good amount of stress and worry whenever I feel left out of something. When I was younger, I had a severe social anxiety disorder I have since overcome, but I believe remnants of that anxiety still exists. I wish I could convince myself it was all in my head, but I have a suspicion there's something real to me feeling left out of situations too.

When I first came here, I had some trouble making friends. I've since made friends, but because most of them developed a bond with each other before I really came into the picture I don't feel like I'm as close with them. I have friends, but I don't think I have very many GOOD friends. Nobody ever texts me to get food. Nobody ever tells me about parties and social gatherings unless I ask them. I think they might even have a separate group message without me. I take ignored texts personally--I would rather be told no outright than left in the dark so I could at least do something about my situation.

I don't want this to become another ""look at me, I'm sad about my life"" soapbox confession, because that's not my point.

My point is, we're becoming adults. High school and middle school is over. Be nice to people. Treat them with respect. Don't belittle people. Stop leaving people in the dark--be blunt. Be honest and open about how you feel, even if it's negative. It feels shitty for anyone, but people currently suffering from/with a history of anxiety feel even worse. The truth hurts, but being stuck in limbo hurts even more. Face your issues head on and attack them."
2064,2014-11-19 23:10:53,"I’m tired of hearing people complain about “social justice warriors,” “activists,” and generally anyone cares about anything that’s not themselves **just because they aren’t perfect and nice and sweet as cherry pie all the time**. The issues we’re bringing up about these people aren’t unique to them.

Why do people want to be doctors? To help people? To make money? Because it’s what they’ve been told to do? Because they just enjoy it? Because they want to be “successful?” Are these mutually exclusive?

Why do people go into any field? Do people usually do anything for one set reason? *Everyone* does things for tons of different reasons, and it’s ridiculous to pretend that people who are socially active are the only ones who ever do things wrong, or don’t say things as nicely as they could have, or have bad reasons for wanting to do good things.

I’m all for promoting healthy criticism of each other, but let’s at least be honest and recognize that at the end of the day we’re mostly a bunch of teenagers and young adults just trying to figure ourselves out and have some impact on a world that we’ll never really understand. Yes, people make mistakes. Yes, that includes “problematic” people. Yes, that includes “social justice whatever-you-want-to-call-thems.”

(sorry for caps)
DON’T LET PETTY ISSUES BE THE REASON YOU IGNORE THE SERIOUS ARGUMENTS PEOPLE ARE PUTTING FORTH ABOUT INJUSTICE. Also, let’s not falsely equate feeling ashamed of privilege or being yelled out by your fellow tuition-paying students is the *same* as being continually messed over by employers, and city planners, and police, and the justice system, and politicians, and just about everything else."

I can rationalize that he and I aren't a good fit for each other (we just aren't a great match personality wise) but every time I get around him, all the work he's put in to get me to respond to him works against me and I can't leave him. Even though I know we shouldn't be together, as a sub it's nearly impossible to find the courage to tell him that. I'm nervous that I'll never be able to leave him and I'll be stuck in a relationship that, although sexually satisfying, won't make me happy."

2068,2014-11-19 22:58:58,"I confess that I hate the concept of White Privilege. It's just fucking stupid.

Why would you describe the suffering of one group of people by shaming another group for not having gone through that suffering.
Every time I see people post about White Privilege, or Male Privilege I just wonder what the fuck I am supposed to do as a white dude. Am I supposed to feel bad for being born a white man, am I a worse person now? I sure fucking hope not.

It seems like a culture has risen recently that says fight fire with fire instead of put the fire out. Instead of saying ""don't be racist"" and ""don't be sexist"", I hear people say ""all white people are lucky to be white, all men have it easy, they're privileged"".

You can let people know that racism, sexism, and all other forms of discrimination exist without shaming them for not having suffered the discrimination themselves. Stop ostracizing white men, its destructive to progress."

It really hurts because that means that all of our conversations about social justice, which have meant a lot to me, have been pointless. He is clearly minimizing a lot of struggles marginalized communities feel in society (myself being one of them), and probably thinks I'm too ""politically correct"" (as if that is even a thing). It's a little sad because I thought of him as someone really informed or at least really open-minded. I don't know if I should confront him about it or just give up on him altogether."

2072,2014-11-19 20:14:15,"I confess that if you're sick, you should stay away from the library. I get that you're dedicated towards studying but all of you coughing, sneezing, and sniffling make it really distracting, even with my headphones on. Plus you're a lot more likely to get whoever is sitting at the desk sick. Go somewhere where you aren't likely to get someone else sick if you can."
2073,2014-11-19 12:04:20,"As a member of a Wash U greek organization, I confess that greek philanthropy at this school is despicable. Let me give you a picture of how greek philanthropy works. Every greek organization puts on philanthropy events for the other greek organizations and for the student body in general. These are meant to raise money for good causes and promote the fraternity/sorority name. The main reason a greek organization participates in these philanthropy events is so that the other greek organizations will, in turn, participate in their event. Each event has an entry fee (where the money raising comes in), so each greek organization requires members to pay a certain amount in dues to cover these participation fees. So essentially, all of the money has already been raised. The philanthropy events just shuffle it all around. It's a big circle jerk where each greek organization donates a little bit of money to each of the other philanthropy causes. Why can't these organizations just use dues to donate directly to their own cause? That would save time, effort, and (most importantly) money. If these organizations weren't so concerned with looking charitable, they could actually be much more charitable.

And Thurtene...that's the worst part of it all. Greek organizations raise so much money during the year so that they can pay for Thurtene. But Thurtene refuses to tell people how much money they actually raise for charity, begging us to ask if the actual dollar amount is just so embarrassingly small, they don't want people to know--I mean, every other charity in the world loves to brag about how much money they raise. So next time you ""donate"" money to greek philanthropy, just know that you're mostly donating to the reputation of a bunch of privileged Wash U students, and some portion also gets lost to putting on a carnival."

Don't get me wrong, I am so happy for the people who got into Joe's, but at the same time, I wish I was one of them. I feel like a child with a tantrum, but it was something that hit me hard, so I don't know what to do about it. I just want to know if I did anything wrong, or what it is about me that they did not like.

2082,2014-11-18 20:16:34,"Regarding the Ferguson decision, I have not heard a single story from either the media or politicians which I believe to be impartial. The structural system of our country seems far too censored and biased to be trusted anymore. I can hardly imagine what the jury is feeling right now knowing that their decision is going to make international headlines when even the information they receive is likely biased. It would be absolutely great if we, as the people, could actually get some impartial and factual information out of the media and politicians.

Please do not mistake my position, I am very sympathetic to the side of the protesters. I believe that there are tremendous injustices being done by society against the black community which likely led to the shooting of Micheal Brown.

However, I do not believe that the officer should be held accountable for his actions if he sincerely believed that Micheal Brown was a threat. The decision that the jury is making is whether  the officer is culpable for the death of Brown. I do not have the information to determine this but I really wish I did that way I could actually take a side in this protest. Until that day comes, I will remain impartial.
I do appreciate the efforts of protests which point out the injustices being done against the black community everyday. I do not agree with the ones which assert that the officer must be held accountable. I do not believe that anyone in the public has the right to assert whether the officer is culpable because we do not have the information to determine that. We should not deride and make him a pawn simply to further a movement and make a point. I do not believe that this is the intention of most protesters, but I have seen some calling for immediate conviction of the officer. Unfortunately it is often the squeaky wheel that gets the grease, as they say. This leads to misconception and division. Let's do better as a society. Violence need not beget more violence.

As a further point, I appreciate the efforts of organizations like Anonymous which tried to make public information regarding the incident. However, hacking the twitter feed of the KKK and posting a picture of one of them hanging from a tree is doing nobody any good. This is only going to infuriate people who obviously have no regard for basic human rights and freedoms. Nothing good comes of such an action."
2083,2014-11-18 19:59:35,"It breaks my heart that our community is so divided. Everyone has rights as American citizens. In order to have your rights protected as an African American, you must be a saint. But if the individual was not a member of a minority group, one's rights would be protected whether he/she was a saint, murderer, drug addict, thief, cheat, etc. That's just sad. I don't condone illegal activity at all, but making poor decisions is not enough to claim someone does not have rights."
2084,2014-11-18 18:27:37,"I will probably get some hate for this, and that is fine. I feel I should put this out there with the Ferguson decision about to be announced any day now. Although none of us can say for certain what really happened during the incident, frankly, I have no respect for someone who goes and robs a store and beats up the store owner, which is what Michael Brown did. I don't think we should be glorifying a person with low morals, even if he was described as a ""gentle giant""."

I understand that they are busy, but it also is a waste of time and money. I'm not getting better, my time for the appointment is being shaved off for the appointment, yet I still have to pay for the session in full.

2089,2014-11-17 00:35:43,"I can't stand how people automatically assume that if your family is well off, or if you aren't on financial aid at this school, or whatever, that that means you haven't had to work for anything in your life, or that you got in here just because your family could pay for it. I come from a family with money, but I still had a job all throughout high school, and even here I spend my own money when I want things. Of course I recognize my privilege and the fact that many things in my life have been made easier because my family can support me financially and provide me with the resources I need. However, I got into Wash U because of my hard work in high school, which was my own, and did not have to do with my family's financial situation. I continue to succeed thanks to MY work. I work hard in school just like everyone else. I have overcome hardship just like everyone else.

On a different note, my parents and grandparents worked hard to achieve success so that they could support their children and make a better life for their family. Isn't that exactly what most of us are at this school trying to do? It makes no sense to try to make someone feel guilty about the fact that their family has already done this for them.

No person, rich or poor, is better than one another. But just like it is inappropriate to shame someone for their lack of money, it is equally inappropriate to shame someone for being financially well-off. Do not invalidate the hard work of either them or their family."
2090,2014-11-17 00:09:45,"I am in love with someone who will be studying abroad next semester and I am worried that once he is abroad he won't care about me anymore. Friends have suggested that I just let him go because its whats best for him, but I dont think I am ready to."

I say this phrase resonates with me because I'm severely depressed. And yet I'm coming to WashU with no financial stress and I can pretty much buy myself whatever i need; food clothes, entertainment. But I'm not happy. I'm unhappy almost all of the time; I'm just lonely and sad.

And when I can't motivate to do work and talk about trying for lesser pay jobs they scoff at the idea that I'll be able to get by or that pursuing something I love is better than busting my back in classes I hate. I just want my message to get across I guess. Don't waste your time on things you don't enjoy for the sake of them. Do what you love and what inspires you. Yeah you can't compare people who are poor and people who are depressed, but no matter what you'll get through life. Just pick a way to go through it that makes you happy and don't judge someone else for what they have."
2092,2014-11-16 01:16:49,"Every Friday I wake up and think this week I won't have sex with some random guy but every week I let myself down. In the few weeks that I've been here at Wash U, I have had sex with over 25 different guys. Last week I even slept with a 30 year old guy I met at a bar. And this is after coming from a high school where I had sex with just one guy. Every day I think I won't but come the weekend with a little or a lot of alcohol inside me I end up going back with someone to their room. Many of the guys were so unfazed by my willingness to fuck them that they weren't even prepared and didn't have condoms, but that didn't stop me. Best part is I have a boyfriend who does not know about any of this. He doesn't go here but he assumes that when I party all I do is drink, and him finding out is something I fear more than getting an STD because I really love him. I don't know why I'm like this and what to do. I can't seem to stop."

I like him and he's not bad looking either, but I find our relationship kind of awkward. I'm trying to think about how to bring it up to him that I want to get on better terms with each other and see how it goes from there. Like maybe we could get dinner or something together to actually be on a better relationship, too, but at this moment it's just like two strangers trapped in a living room of nothingness... Hopefully we could room together in the future too and maybe beyond college, but at this point I just want to fix our relationship in the present and maybe become something more. After it happens then I think college would finally start putting the metaphorical pieces of the puzzle together for me."

For the most part the people who need to know, know (I.e. companies hiring students, graduate schools, etc.) When people are complaining it is more of an ego problem than anything else.  This attitude sucks and people who do this really should try to get over themselves because newsflash: you're not intrinsically better than anyone else in this world, including people at colleges that ""aren't as good as WashU.""

Focus on whats important. Getting a good education, making great friends and memories, and learning life long lessons outside of the classroom that will help make this world a better place."

2102,2014-11-12 19:34:15,"I used to be like a lot of people here. Freshman year first semester was really hard on me. I had no friends, no motivation, and the rigors of premed had absolutely beaten me to the ground. I had no one to talk to, and I am not the type of person who shares my feelings, so no one really knew what was up.

Now I am a junior, and my life has completely changed. I am still premed, absolutely loving my classes, and joined a fraternity and have friends everywhere on campus.

I'd like to give you guys the same advice that helped me. Don't waste time with self pity. It will only bury you further into the ground. the first step is to accept the situation. accept that right now, things may be shitty. they may not be in the future, but right now thats how things are. Once you accept things, then just set little goals to change things. dont make them big and vague, but small concrete things. I started with say hi to 10 people today. just do something out of your comfort zone. Staying in my comfort zone had only led to self pity, so there wasnt really anything ""comfortable"" about it. Move up and start challenging yourself more.

Looking back I can say this stuff wasnt a big deal, but it seemed like it at that time. Risk things! If you have no friends, starting a conversation can only increase the number from zero.

if studies suck, there are some options. To those premeds, ill say that if you really are interested, hang on! the intro classes are bullshit and i got mostly Bs on them, but now I am getting As on my advanced level courses. the reqs are just hell.

for others in different lines, i offer similar advice. remember that the first couple classes are weed outs, so they are testing to see if you really want to pick up a line. If you have the enthusiasm, then hang in there! If you find you are really lacking enthusiasm, start fulfilling distribution requirements. this will let you diversify your classes and hopefully figure out what you want to major in.

Final Advice- fuck everyone, do what you need to to find your passion. If there is a club you want to make, go make it! it is actually not difficult. The only REAL thing stopping you from happiness is you. if someone else is, then fuck em"

It's a habit that I find incredibly rude, and I've tried nicely mentioning the issue when it pertains to me. Nothing has changed. It's a habit that turns me off a lot, and I'm starting to develop a disgust for my friend a little bit more each time I see it.

People do not understand that equality is two way street. Yes, I believe that racial inequality is a major problem. Yes, I believe that social and economic inequality are problems.-- just because I am a republican does not mean I'm evil, racist, or privileged. But as people go on republican hating tangents in class, they do not realize that they are not treating me with equality.  I don't care if you don't agree with my political ideology-- the beauty of America is that you don't have to agree with me! But I do expect the same respect with which I treat people of different views. Today, I stop feeling ashamed. I'm a republican and proud of it."

2110,2014-11-12 00:50:29,I secretly want to have sex with my boyfriend so badly but I haven't even let him touch my butt or boobs.
2111,2014-11-12 00:40:32,"If I could rewind my life a few years, I'd definitely go to my state school instead of Wash U, not only because it's closer, costs less, and all that, but also because it's a Division 1 school. College sports is really almost a quintessential experience because it brings students together and gives them something to be proud of. Since no one pays attention to D3 sports, there's little to be proud of at Wash U. And I also confess that I think Wash U's prestige factor is nothing but hot air. Going to a prestigious school means everyone will recognize your school for it; if you have to explain what city your school is, then it means people don't recognize it and it's not a good school; it's as simple as that. I've regretted coming here so much that I actually have been telling new people I meet outside of Wash U that I attend my state school."
2112,2014-11-11 19:07:34,"I am a student worker on campus, i know it's my duty to serve visitors, but all workers should be treated with respect! Today during my shift, a woman came to me and asked me where was a certain event that happened at 2. I looked up online, there was no event consistent with her description, so i asked her if there were other keywords that might be helpful for searching. She was really rude and said 'I don't think there is a lot of event happens at 2' with a super grumpy attitude. So I went over all event that happened at 2, there was again no correct result. I apologized that there was nothing i could find to help her, and suggested her to go to the department right next and to see if the event was there. She replied she just went there and the person there told her to come to me; and she asked me to CALL MY SUPERVISOR!!! Eventually, i found out that the name and time of the event she gave me were all wrong (that's why i couldn't find anything); and during the whole process she was harsh and mean like it was my fault her event didn't show up as she described. I have always love my job and i am happy to serve everyone, but to her, i would say, she is a totally bitch"
2113,2014-11-11 15:11:35,"So long ago I figured out I was gay, and went through the tumultuous coming out process and got very comfortable with my identity.  These days, however, I'm starting to get more and more attracted to girls, which is a serious problem because I can't just tell people I'm bi all of a sudden- it would betray everything they thought they knew about me.  Plus my family would end up thinking I was confused and flaky."
2114,2014-11-11 05:31:37,"I am a freshman who is freaking out about housing next year. I have a lot of friends in general, but I sitll havent found a core group of friends who I can reliably hang out with all the time. There are not a group of people exactly on my freshman floor who I can see myself living with, so I do not have that immediate group of friends on m floor. I dont know, I just feel like everyone already knows who they are living with next year except me."
2115,2014-11-11 05:03:38,I must confess that I kind of hate this school for having so many attractive AND nice people. How am I supposed to narrow down my prospects??
2116,2014-11-10 16:58:40,"YO so I got a smart phone just like most people these days.  I think the technology is just fuckin amazing and super convenient, I mean it's like having a little computer in your pocket at all times.  However, sometimes I am saddened when I walk around between classes and see a ton of people looking down at their phone instead of taking in life.  I mean don't get me wrong I do that shit sometimes and ya if you gotta be in contact with someone then sure it makes sense, but how about we put away our phones for once and just enjoy our surroundings and take in the world because it's pretty dope!"
2117,2014-11-10 16:58:41,"I'm a male student who frequently skips 2 meals a day. Usually I'll have a small snack like a granola bar for breakfast and then I'll make something like pasta later on at night. I eat a lot of pasta because it's something I can save money on by making a few nights' worth at once. I would like to eat more often, but I simply can't afford it. Driving is not an option, and taking the bus to the grocery store there and back is time I really don't have. I figure I'm definitely not getting all the nutrients I need, but I'm really surprised how well my body has adjusted to my new ""diet"". I lost a bit of weight which I gained over the summer, and I definitely enjoy my dinner much more. This has made me really appreciate what I have, and I recognize a lot more clearly what it means to have food on the table."
2118,2014-11-10 15:42:42,There seems to be a lot of us lonely people at Wash U looking for quality relationships.  I wonder if a programming savvy person could devise a college dating website for Wash U students that was less superficial than Tindr.
2119,2014-11-10 15:26:43,My suite mates don't realize that I cry myself to sleep every night because I'm so tired of being alone while they are all in relationships. I need people to stop seeing me as just someone they can hook up with. I'm tired of being used and tossed out. I just feel so alone.
2120,2014-11-10 00:21:45,"I find the world unfair on which I, as a tutor, earn the same money per hour by explaining concepts and solving problems to people non-stop for an hour with some of the camera operators in the lectures who basically goes into the booth, turn on the camera, set it at an angle that sees all of the boards at the same time (who cares about whether you can read the stuff on the board, right?) and turn it off at the end of the lecture. Oh, and you also don't have to have the audio recorded... (This rant is definitely not meant for the camera operators who do a brilliant job of following the professor with the camera and zooming in/out at the right places--you all keep up the good work!)"
2121,2014-11-09 22:48:48,"I confess that I was raised Catholic, and attended Catholic school for 12 years, but no longer believe in God or identify as a Catholic. However, I went to Mass a few weeks ago, and though I thought most of it was bullshit, it all felt like home to me--the songs, the prayers, the actions. I know many former Catholics have a falling out with the Church and hate returning to Mass, but I almost enjoyed it. It was like catching up with an old friend who I don't want to remain friends with but it was still nice to see each other...if that makes any sense. I'd love to believe in God or a higher being that can drive my life forward and give me confidence that I won't just die and then disappear into oblivion, but I just haven't been able to do so. I just wish I could find a religion with all the love and caring that I found at Catholic school but with none of the God or Jesus stuff. I have such a high respect for people who are deeply religious and have such great faith, because I just can't find any kind of personal satisfaction in religion."
2122,2014-11-09 21:04:49,"I confess that I have a serious problem with procrastination. Sure, I know most people struggle with it too, but for me, it seems like I can never focus on one assignment without having to go onto Facebook or listen to YouTube. It's even gotten to the point that I would spend an hour or so browsing the internet with no purpose. Initially, since it kind of started at the end of my high school career, I thought it was senioritis. However, as I progressed through my college career until now (I'm a junior), it has become more prevalent. The worse case was just a few weeks ago when I have a paper due and I finally decided to do it a hour before the due date. Unfortunately, I did not get it finished, and I'm pretty sure it was a terrible paper. Plus, I blame my procrastination on why I received a C in Bio I, Chem II, and Orgo I (which was a summer course).

While I currently have a 3.21 GPA, I feel inadequate compared to my friends and peers who are struggling but are able to maintain a GPA above 3.5. My friends and my parents often comfort me by saying that ""Everyone does it."" That's true, but I feel like I do it too much. And the thing is, I tried a lot of techniques: scheduling; planners; setting thirty-minute limits; studying with others; studying away from my room. They either don't work or work for only a short amount of time. Maybe I'm just too weak-willed.

I know that there are people who are not doing as well academically as I am, and I know that everyone struggles with procrastination, but I would like to at least manage it better so I don't end up with a GPA that is undesirable for the grad schools I am applying. Does anyone have any suggestions?"
2123,2014-11-09 21:48:52,"I confess that I no longer identify as Christian, and it has made all the difference. I was raised in a Christian community and I honestly had a pretty good time at church, but one thing never sat right with me. There was always an undercurrent of fear. We would dance and sing, but we were always warned that hell awaited us if we didn't do right. I still identified as Christian until my sophomore year of college all because I feared going to hell if I didn't. I don't fear hell anymore. Since renouncing Christianity, I am able to contextualize myself and the world around me in an open and free way. I'm not saying that irreligiousness is necessarily the best route for people as many religions do in fact do great things for people, but if you are only clinging to a religion due to ANY type of fear then you may be wasting your time."
2124,2014-11-09 21:14:53,All I really want recently is for some guy to pull my hair and let me bite them and have ridiculous crazy sex. Is that so bad?
2125,2014-11-09 18:21:55,"I confess that my freshman year I struggled with anorexia, depression, and considered suicide at one point. Three years later, I have overcome these struggles (mostly, I still have lapses sometimes) and am finally mostly happy with myself and my relationships.

SHS was probably the worst resource I went to because the doctor tried to scare me into eating. I understood my internal organs could fail and I was a few pounds from being hospitalized, but when someone tells you to eat 3000 calories when you're used to eating close to nothing, you kind of freak out. At least I did. But I did really want to get better, maybe just a little more slowly SHS thought I should. They were trying to help, just not in a way that worked for me.

Making new friends and joining clubs with people I enjoyed, helped  relieve my depression and anorexia. When I was happier, I would start eating more. It also helped when I began setting small goals for myself (like running a half marathon, finishing knitting a scarf, finishing a paper). I planned my time around student groups, work, and alone time. Just creating schedules made me feel like I was living with a purpose and helped me regain control of my life. I really wanted to get better, which was what ultimately helped me overcome my anorexia especially. Yea, my grades were horrible my freshman year, but I utilized cornerstone on campus and was able to raise my GPA significantly by my senior year.

Before I end this rant, I want to mention one thing. A person can become depressed when they feel they lack to a purpose in life and have an inability to form or maintain relationships, either platonic or romantic. What I do not understand, however, is when people say that they're happiness is dependent on having a boyfriend. Some of my friends who have been depressed have told me that they think having a boyfriend will make their problems go away because a boyfriend is supposed to always love you. I disagree with this completely.  I had a boyfriend throughout all of my issues. Yes, he helped to some extent, but having him around did not solve my problems. The point I am trying to make is that having a boyfriend can help, but will never remove the underlying issues. More likely, your depression and self-loathing will pop up in your relationship and have negative consequences. It did in my case, but we were able to overcome this and it eventually strengthened our relationship.

I don't really expect anyone to read this, but it was on my mind and it's nice to finally write this. I've been trying to work out how I finally got over my anorexia and depression and writing this was immensely helpful. I can't ever say that I would want to repeat my freshman year, but I think I turned out better because of it."
2126,2014-11-09 18:33:56,"In light of the recent Victoria's Secret ""Perfect Body"" campaign, I confess that the aversion to skinny women being called beautiful makes me feel hideous.  I have been a size 0, been called anorexic and referred to psychologists and eating disorder specialists for years.  I want to be thin and be able to love my body without feeling like others resent me.  I agree that all body types should be called beautiful, but I don't think thin women should have to be ashamed of themselves in order to achieve universal acceptance."
2127,2014-11-09 18:12:57,"I confess that I often skip meals, not because I think I'm trying to lose weight and not because I'm trying to save money, but simply because WashU food is overpriced and I don't feel like buying more meal points or cooking for myself."
2128,2014-11-09 17:47:58,"I confess that I feel overloaded with homework and exams and final projects and clubs and trying to have a social life, and I don't know how to handle it all. My grades are unsatisfactory but I'm studying my hardest and doing my best. I feel like I have no friends and I'm freaking out about who I'm going to live with next year. I'm just really anxious and having a tough time, and it seems like everyone else has their shit together but me."
2129,2014-11-09 16:31:11,I confess that i am pretty shy. I wish that I was more outgoing. Any suggestions on how I can be more outgoing?
2130,2014-11-09 13:35:12,"I understand the importance of preferred pronouns and changing them daily to fit whatever mood you're in, and I'm glad the greater WashU community is usually cool with non-heteronormative individuals, but I think the pride community is too nice. Students go by ""zi/hir"" and that's all jolly, but once you graduate and get out to the real world, NO ONE CARES. Most jobs and people won't care if you're zi/zir or they/them. You'll be whatever you were assigned at birth and that's the truth."
2131,2014-11-09 13:47:14,"I confess that I feel incredibly isolated. Everyone else seems to be able to connect with other people and understand social interaction, but I'm just constantly baffled. I want to understand that"
2132,2014-11-09 13:10:15,"I act really confident, but I'm actually SUPER conflicted about my sex life. I'm in a love/hate relationship with hookups and casual sex."
2133,2014-11-07 01:21:20,"So the last few weeks have been absolute crap for me. Academics have been consuming my time and my spirit (with less than spectacular results), I've been feeling incredibly down, I've spent next to no time with the people I care about and I've gotten really sick to the point where I'm visiting SHS biweekly. I've lost my voice and appetite, I get hardly any sleep and fun's more like a vaguely remembered  friend from middle school than anything tangible.
The last time I was in SHS, I got called up as another student entered the lobby. He beat me to the desk and asked for an appointment and got told to fill out a little slip.

 As I despondently walked up with another twenty bucks and my insurance card thinking ""this is my life, can I return it for another one"" I briefly glanced over at the guy and his slip:
CAUSE OF VISIT: ACCIDENTALLY SWALLOWED PENCIL
Thank you sir. I don't know who you were before this and where you went after, but I felt so much better after reading that damn slip of yours. May you prosper and never shit a splinter."
2134,2014-11-06 23:51:21,"Earlier in the semester, I think during early September at night, I was upset about something and ended up crying on the phone with my mother in that area behind Mallinckrodt,as it's usually empty by that time.  A tall, handsome guy walked by and asked if I was okay.  I tried to smile and say fine, but I think I was just so embarrassed that I may have come off as defensive.

It may seem silly, but I've felt horrible the past couple of months about possibly coming off as rude to one of those rare students who will stop and ask a stranger if they're doing okay.  So, if he sees this, I still really appreciate the gesture.  And I hope my reaction doesn't discourage him from being as kind to the next person."
2135,2014-11-06 23:39:22,"I confess that I just found out the girl I've been dating for a little while now has been doing the same thing with multiple other guys while feigning exclusivity, and she still hasn't come clean.  If she'd told me at the start, maybe we could've worked something out, but now I just want her gone.  I don't appreciate being manipulated and used, and I have self-respect.  I just wish people would be honest and up-front, at least that way I don't lose all my dignity..."
2136,2014-11-06 00:40:24,That awkward moment when you're not sure if you came out to your friend while blackout or if it was a dream
2137,2014-11-06 00:28:25,"I confess that I'm as confused as ever. I'm a senior female who was raised in a conservative family and always thought that I should live by ""traditional"" values when I was young. In high school, I never had an interest in drinking or hooking up... I liked spending quiet nights with my boyfriend at the time. When he and I got into different colleges, he wanted to stay together but I listened to my friends who urged me to be ""free"" from responsibilities. They told me that I should just worry about myself and just focus on having fun when I got to college. So I took their advice and showed up to college as a single woman! I felt awful leaving my boyfriend behind... but I figured that it was just part of growing up.

Not wanting to be a party girl, I spent my first semester dating a couple boys... and it wasn't long until I found myself in another relationship. Maybe I just felt scared being alone... but nonetheless, I tried my best to be a good girlfriend for him. Everything seemed fine until we got back from winter break and he admitted to me that he cheated on me when he was home! Heartbroken and upset, I swore that I wouldn't let any boy hurt me like that again. I spent my spring semester drinking for the first time and going to frat parties... forcing myself to hook up with random guys but then not allowing myself to develop feelings for them. I thought I could be stone cold. Like Post #1681, I became addicted to the attention that came with hooking up... but each time I left the guy's room or he left mine, I would feel completely empty inside. Like what I was doing just wasn't right. I was trying to be this strong independent feminist woman, but all my efforts to put up emotional walls just led to all of my emotions being bottled up inside, consuming me. While I'm not suicidal, it has gotten to the point where I've thought about hurting myself.

I just want to be happy... I put on this fake mask that I'm this tough person who can handle anything. But in reality, I miss caring for someone else and having that person care about me in return. I'll never admit it to my friends... but I wish I could learn to trust a man again because I don't want to hook up anymore. I wish I was in a happy relationship... I just feel like it's not going to happen though."
2138,2014-11-06 00:44:26,"I confess that when I was taking my tampon out today, some blood flung onto the stall door. Then it was a race to wipe it off before it dripped on the ground. Oops..."
2139,2014-11-06 00:25:28,"I confess that I used to go to frat parties (God knows why, probably too drunk) and would tell my friends I was leaving because I ""wasn't feeling it."" Oh no. It was because I was so afraid of potential interaction. I was literally scared shitless of dealing with people because I'm a pussy. Good game, fear. You won."
2140,2014-11-05 13:53:29,"I think that professor Trobaugh is really Rand Paul in disguise. Shit, he probably fights crime by night too. This is better than Indiana Jones!"
2141,2014-11-05 12:07:32,"I confess that I've written so many washu admirers posts about myself that when I saw one about me I didn't write, I was genuinely surprised."
2142,2014-11-05 11:08:34,"I confess that I am a sex addict. I’m 21 and I’ve already had sex with more than fifty people. It’s reached the point where I have to sleep with at least one person a day in order to satisfy my addiction. I have to balance having four or five fuck buddies at a time in order to make sure that at least one is available when I want sex. Well, guess what? I’m a heterosexual, attractive woman. This makes it even harder to break my addiction because it’s always so easy to find a generally attractive man that will be more than happy to have a one-night-stand or no-strings-attached relationship. It was easy to learn how to expertly and quickly pick up men for hookups.

When I first starting having all this sex, I did it as a kind of crazy social experiment. My desire was to prove to myself and others that a woman can play the same game as men in our hookup culture…that it was easy to have a random hookup with a man and not care at all to ever see him again….that I could use men just for my sexual pleasure in the same way that many men use women. This desire stemmed shortly after I was raped by two men. After that happened, sex lost all its emotional value for me. I was frustrated and angry over this value that I lost, so I sought a mental revenge against men. I would use them the same way they had used me.

Alas, my emotionally hollow sex life has only made me feel more frustrated and angry because now, in addition to having lost its emotional value, sex is starting to lose its physical value. It’s hard to get turned on when you’ve seen and done it all often. I feel guilty for the way I use men, especially when they fall for me and I reject them. To be fair, they usually fall for my body or the way I sexually please them, not for the whole me. But I refuse them the chance to try a traditional, exclusive relationship because I can’t bring myself to trust a single man and because that would require me to stop myself from sleeping with another man, something very difficult to do when I have a sex addiction. In my sick mind, all men only want to use me, when in reality, I’m the one using them."
2143,2014-11-04 20:16:35,"I think my girlfriend kind of assumes that we'll live together after we graduate. I'm not so sure how to bring up the fact that I'd rather not officially live together with a significant other until we're married. I mean, we've been dating for a few years but I feel like saying something like that will send the wrong impression. Any suggestions?"
2144,2014-11-04 19:59:37,"I'm still attracted to my RA. At first I thought it was just the excitement of being in a new place with new people, but even now that everything has calmed down I find myself wanting to spend more  time with him. I know that there are certain boundaries that shouldn't be crossed, and I would agree that it would be inappropriate for an RA to have relations with a resident, but damn. I really feel like we get along well and I want to know more about him, but at the same time I feel like being around him more is just making it worse. I don't know what to do."

2147,2014-11-03 19:00:41,I've had sex with both a girl and a guy (separately) in my bed in a 24 hour span. Neither knew I played for both teams.
2148,2014-11-02 19:25:42,"I confess that I'm intensely uncomfortable at parties, so uncomfortable that I enter a vicious cycle of discomfort, drinking to cope, and worse discomfort from drinking while upset. I keep going because friends want to go, because of a rare few times where I've had a good time, because what else can I do on weekends, and because where else can I try (but fail) to get sexual gratification. I'm not here to bash so-called ""hookup culture"", or party culture. I just wish there were a place for me, in them or somewhere else."
2149,2014-11-02 19:55:43,"I don't know what it is about me, but a lot of people think I'm a virgin. Some people even think I've never kissed anyone. Even this girl I was seeing this summer thought I was a virgin. I wish I gave off a not-a-virgin vibe instead of giving off this virgin vibe. I don't want girls that I find attractive to think I'm a bad/clumsy lover. I'm not saying I'm the best. But I do know what I'm doing."
2150,2014-11-02 19:48:45,It took me several extra years to come out of the closet because I didn't want to feel like I had to hang out with the SJW and become one myself. Luckily I found that the gay community is far more interesting than the washu gay community would suggest

2153,2014-11-01 19:27:52,"I confess that my eating disorder has gotten so bad that I've decided I need help, but I just dont have the courage to go to SHS because I've talked to Connie and other ED treatment team member before and they thought I know way beyond average on nutrition and can approach the subject from a scientific and objective way. I am also involved in some of the groups which promote healthy eating on campus. I'm not thinking I'm gonna disappoint someone or something by seeking help but I just can't let that image of me shatter to pieces."
2154,2014-11-01 19:15:53,"I confess that I am overweight - by ""the size of average Wash U student"" standard, probably not by the BMI standard. Last week when I was heading downstairs to get an omelet my boyfriend asked me to buy one for him too. And that is the most awkward, uncomfortable experience ever. I might be overthinking but it just feels like everyone is judging me, like ""how dare this fat b***h dare eat two omelet shouldn't you be ashamed of that"". There was a guy in the line before me who also ordered two omelet and I'm certain that the chef was less surprised when he ordered. Well it can be perfectly explained by guys generally eat more so it's always surprising when a girl eat as much as a guy do. Well I don't think people in the line mean to judge me that day (I might be wrong though)...but considering that after I've told my boyfriend I'd rather to stand in the line twice than ever order two serves of food again right away, I'm still taking time to write this confession a full week later, I'm really bothered by my thoughts."

I know that guys often like to pay for the first date, but it doesn't seem like he should pay if he needs to work a job to pay for the dinner when I just need to go into my bank account. But it also feels awkward to bring up..."
2157,2014-11-01 03:24:57,I learned how to cook from watching the chefs in BD while waiting on line.
2158,2014-11-01 03:05:58,"I confess that I've told some of my friends that I've had sex when it isn't true. Oh the depths guys will sink to in order to ""be cool."" I didn't want to be the only virgin, so I became one of many liars. Honestly it's hard to live with."
2159,2014-11-01 03:46:11,"In response to the Loft hate, I used to live in UTerrace.  It was small, dark, smelly, and within apartments, there was half an inch or so of space between the walls and the ceiling.  In my time there, there were riots, shootings, carjackings, and countless muggings within a block of where I lived.  There was an armored truck permanently posted on the intersection of Skinker and Delmar.

I still loved it.  I loved living on the Loop, and I loved getting to know its denizens (talk to homeboy with all facial the piercings if he's still around; he's a cool guy).  Living on the Loop provided a thoroughly different experience from what I might have had on campus, and the 11 minute walk to the library - or two minute bike ride - was never overly-burdensome.

For those complaining about the Lofts, I'd invite you to appreciate what you have.  Your accommodation is far superior to what mine was, you have a unique opportunity to experience one of STL's cultural landmarks, and of course, the heightened university presence will, I suspect, lower the level of criminal behavior, making the Loop safer for everyone, not just the WashU community.  It may not be what you wanted, but it's hardly deserving of the animus it seems to have inspired in some of its residents

But more importantly, treasure your transitory time at WashU while you have it, and don't let it be marred by dissatisfaction with your housing.  It will be over far too quickly."

2161,2014-10-31 15:18:14,"I also hate living in the Lofts. They're a huge ""fuck you"" to the U City community and the students. I hate the fact that I'm living in a glitzy building while there are people panhandling outside my window. It's not that I hate the panhandling; I'd just rather live in something more modest while others out there are suffering.

I was essentially forced into the Lofts, because I planned on going abroad. This meant I had to live in ResLife housing, because no one except Quadrangle is going to give you a 6 month lease (and there were no apartments left by the time I looked). Come time for housing selection, I had a shit lottery number, and ended up with the most expensive housing option: the Lofts.

I'm not going to donate a dime to this school. Instead, I'm going to donate to organizations that help the people outside my window."
2162,2014-10-31 10:39:15,"I confess that I hate living in the Lofts and I wouldn't do it again if I had the chance to do it all over again. It's a building built on broken promises and shoddy work. Plus those who administer the buildings seems to have an overinflated sense of purpose. We are adults living in apartments, not children living in boarding school. I don't need security guards monitoring me or my activities, I don't need overzealous staff telling me what I can and can not do, and I certainly don't need the University pretending like they are doing anyone favors by ""letting"" us live here when half of the apartments are empty anyway. This is and was a waste of money."
2163,2014-10-30 23:35:20,"I once stole 15 pounds of cheese (5 Parmesan, 10 Cheddar) from the pizza station at the DUC. To be fair though, I believe I am justified because I view the cheese as communal property of the school. Don't ask me to share though, I already ate it all."

2166,2014-10-30 18:25:24,"I confess that the boxed water at WILD tastes super gross. I know it is more environmentally friendly and cheaper, but I think encouraging drunk people to drink good tasting water over soda is worth the price. I think SPB should do what WashU did at last year's graduation and provide canned water."
2167,2014-10-29 00:35:25,"I hate, HATE, when girls say ""he got me drunk"" ... Did he force alcohol down your throat? Inject it through an IV? People have such a hard time taking responsibility for their actions."

2169,2014-10-28 20:36:28,"As a guy, it's frustrating that I can't sexually perform well at all unless I really am attracted to the girl, which could take days, weeks, months to happen. I've tried hooking up a few times before, but every time was a massive disappointment to the girl, just because I wasn't into it. This starts to form a vicious cycle, because I feel pressure to perform really well when I finally do get intimate with a girl I really like, but to perform well I need experience, and I can't get experience because I don't want to really hook up casually."
2170,2014-10-28 15:13:29,"When I was young, maybe six or seven years old, my aunt used to touch my penis. She said that it was okay because we're close, and that I was a good boy. At the time I was too much of a ""good boy"" to say no to my own aunt. Only later did I understand that I had been molested.

That was more than a decade ago, and the memory faded away quite a lot, but it still feels like a rock is sitting inside my chest every time I think of her. I wonder if she remembers her deeds."
2171,2014-10-28 13:19:32,"I confess that, after reading many posts against Wash-U's administration, I personally am still here BECAUSE of it. I've never felt like ""just a number"" at this university: I've had to go on multiple medical leaves because of family issues, depression, and lack of motivation due to the wrong major. At any other University, I would've been kicked out by now for having a GPA lower than 2.0. Instead, I've had uplifting, personal conversations with the Dean of students, multiple faculty advisors I've exchanged personal e-mails with, and a myriad of professors who've taken personal interest in my journey here. Best of all, I'm here on a full scholarship (I only pay for my meal plan, health plan, books, and activity fees) and it will be extended to cover the semesters I've missed. Student-wise? I've made ONE friend who's kept in-touch with me, even though home is less than half an hour away. I might get some flack for saying this, but sometimes there are more important things a University has to worry about than the community around it and other societal issues. And for all the students struggling, sometimes all you have to do is ASK FOR HELP!"

2173,2014-10-28 11:20:35,"How is it fair that I work my ass off at a campus job to pay for my living expenses, clothes and medical bills, but my friends get a free ride from their parents?  So many kids at this school drive really nice cars that they didn't pay for, and they don't have to work or pay taxes."
2174,2014-10-27 17:59:37,"I have so many feelings about WashU. I love the people I've met here dearly. There are incredibly amazing, inspiring, knowledgeable people here. I have met my best friends here. I hate the administration though. WashU is part of a community, a city, a nation, and a world that is working through deeply rooted issues and systems of oppression, and yet we do so little. Every action I see from the administration and if I'm honest the student body and myself is to improve an image. We never reach the heart of the issues.

But mostly, I feel thankful to WashU. Because of the incredible, inspiring staff, students, and faculty I have met in my time here (I have so much love for you guys), I am who I am today. Yes, who I am today is not who I ultimately want to be. I have a hell of a long way to go before I reach that point. But I do know that WashU has placed me on the path I want to follow and I don't know if I would have found this path if I wasn't here."
2175,2014-10-27 17:15:38,"The new WashU Confessions profile picture is really depressing. Please change it. I usually just lurk, but I'm posting to say that seeing the new logo in my newsfeed makes my mood go down. We need that sunny background to counteract these oft-depressing confessions!"
2176,2014-10-27 17:03:40,"I'm proud of what I've done at WashU, but I feel so inferior to everyone else because I'm not in a frat. Even the sight of Greek letters on shirts/jackets around campus makes me feel small and powerless."
2177,2014-10-27 17:48:41,"I no longer feel connected to anyone; none of my frat brothers, none of my closest friends from last year, my parents and I only sporadically text, and my only interaction with my family is seeing lame facebook statuses.
I don't even care."
2178,2014-10-27 17:23:42,"I confess that when I saw someone write that Che Guevara was a ""hero"" on a poster, it made me very upset.  My stepmothers family endured brutal persecution at the hands of Guevara's murder squads.

2180,2014-10-27 17:27:45,"I confess that I walked in on another girl purging in the bathroom at Bear's Den. I looked down and saw her bent over the toilet. All I can say is that I was there three years ago and it's not the way to go. But I wonder what she's going through, because when I started hurling at 18 it was because a guy had gotten me drunk one night, took my virginity and then made off with my best friend. It makes me think that eating disorders aren't about the body at all."

2182,2014-10-27 17:52:49,"I have multiple learning disabilities and as a result I have a tremendous difficulty reading and (sometimes) writing. I am able to cope fairly well with these disabilities as a part of my own reality, but the more stressed out I get, the more affected I am by my disabilities. It's gotten to the point before where I can't physically read words on a page. My friends often (without intention of harm) make fun of me for my reading, spelling, and speaking abilities when I slip.

I'm writing this post because most people assume that if you're attending a school like Wash U you're well prepared and intelligent, which means physically reading and writing come naturally. I'm guessing it's very hard for some people to understand how emotionally and mentally straining it is for many people with learning disabilities (especially those who don't have access to resources) to deal with academic pressures when it's sometimes so difficult to translate the medium which information and concepts are being presented though.

I can't tell you how many times fellow students, teachers, and even professors have labeled me as lazy or apathetic because I didn't finish my readings or essays. The truth is, sometimes I can't finish my work; sometimes I can't understand the letters staring at me as words; sometimes I can't speak coherently; and sometimes I can't express my most complex and most simple thoughts properly. It's important to be respectful of all people's thought processes. Never dismiss somebody's disabilities because of their intelligence or achievements."

2184,2014-10-26 23:36:53,"I confess have a somewhat laughable dilemma and really need help! But, let me preface this by saying I don't consider this racist and hope not to offend anyone.

I really find a girl I know through mutual friends attractive, and kind of get the vibe that she's into me too.  The problem is, she's asian and has an exact replica of her on campus. Like straight how i met your mother doppleganger status! I'm also very distantly friends with that girl too, so if I mix them up, you see the predicament.

I've never been good at remembering names, but it's especially difficult when distinguishing asian people. I think it's because I come from an area that doesn't have many.

Anyways, WHAT DO I DO?"
2185,2014-10-26 15:41:55,"I have a thing for kissing guys who have never been kissed. I have no idea why, I just really want to do it. (I've only actually acted on the urge twice.)"
2186,2014-10-26 12:13:56,No one knows but lately I've been struggling with disordered thoughts about eating. Today I ate breakfast even though I told myself I wasn't going to eat anything for the next three days. I'm pretty damn proud of myself and wanted someone to know :)
2187,2014-10-25 21:49:57,"Yesterday, I decided to forsake WILD and have some alone time. I grabbed dinner at Fitz's and all went well. Then, before I was about to leave, a man carrying a pitcher a beer for his friends approached me asking why I wasn't with some ""fine b****es."" I laughed it off nervously, hoping that he would leave while not trying to insult him. He left, only to come back later to pursue the topic again. I then provided a false excuse: I had a girlfriend at home. With that, he tried to make a half-moral by saying that I should keep my options open career-wise, but then added that I should do the same with women.

Now, mind you, I was not offended by anyway. If any, I probably felt a little more conscious about my status as a single, heterosexual male, but other than that, I'm fine. However, I just wanted to inquire the Wash U community on one thing: Is being in a relationship so imbued in our culture (US moreso) that being seen alone in a restaurant or movies is seen as an anomaly or an affront to your masculinity/femininity? Once again, I'm not hurt in any way, and I don't have a problem with friends; I just wanted to know the general opinion about this issue (if it is one)."
2188,2014-10-25 20:40:58,I'm the one who farted at WILD. Sorry.
2189,2014-10-25 20:30:11,"A few days ago, as I was buying lunch at BD, one of the male workers said “you should be a model”. I was of course flattered at first by the compliment and said thank you, but then he continued to ask “why are you here? Why aren’t you a model?” and I preceded to laugh and say it was because I’ve always wanted to do science. By that time, our interaction at the cashier was over, and I was on my way. While I understand he was trying to be nice and give me a compliment, I can’t help but feel as if I am constantly having to explain my choice to pursue academia. I am a female sophomore BME student with dreams of getting a PhD and running my own research lab, but in the year and a half I have been here, I have been told numerous times “you’re too pretty to be at Wash U,” or like the cashier at BD, “you should have been a model”. I know they are well intentioned compliments, but every time I hear them  all I hear is that my nights spend studying until 3 am and the times I’ve had to sacrifice what I love for my career are all worth nothing because I’m ‘pretty’. That I, as a woman, should value beauty above all else and strive to be attractive for men.  That no matter how hard I work, my accomplishments will always matter less than my outward appearance. Yes, I am a woman. Yes, I am what you may call ‘attractive’. But I am so many other things. I am in a scholarship program. I have over a 3.75 GPA. I am committing my life to artificial organ research because my grandfather died on the transplant list.  I am here because I worked my ASS off to be here. I am here because my parents are putting a second mortgage on our house to pay for my schooling. I am here as a woman, but more importantly, as a person. So next time you tell me I’m “too pretty to be here”, dig a little bit deeper, because I can assure you I have much, much more to offer."
2190,2014-10-25 20:23:12,I spent WILD drinking alone while watching netflix.
2191,2014-10-25 20:18:14,"I did LAUNCH a while ago. I think I lost the ""Warm and Fuzzies"" we did; the people in my group and I don't talk much now but I was going through a really rough time when I came here and what they wrote was really comforting, even if they did it just to have something to say. I can't find the thing I put them in, and I know I brought them back with me. I'm really scared because some of those messages helped me get through a tough period and I like those memories."
2192,2014-10-25 20:06:15,"I just got caught shoplifting. And I'm weirdly okay with that. I'm not sure what to make of this. I think I actually felt relief when I was caught - it might have turned into a really bad habit. I know this might affect my job prospects but I'm glad that I got caught in the beginning. Somehow I feel like I don't have to pretend to be perfect anymore. It's official that I have this dark side. My main source of panic is my parents finding out. It might be a one time thing, but I've managed to build up this model child image of myself and they are going to be so disappointed. But I'm hoping to resolve this at my end - as an adult - because this might just be the push I needed to see myself as one and begin to actually take into account the consequences of my actions."
2193,2014-10-25 20:01:20,"I confess that as a senior I've never went to WILD. Well technically I went once stayed for 5 mins and left because the music was way too loud for me. I am pretty much aversive to loud music, wild party, alcohol, and the like. This has nothing to do with religious reasons...I'm not affiliated with any specific religion...I just don't like them. While I do want friends, I would much prefer socializing over a dinner or a movie, or go to an amusement park or cardinals games together, or even go to the gym or library together. Not sure whether that's why I basically have no friends. I feel that saying that I never drink and don't want anything alcoholic more than a small glass of wine in fancy meals for the foreseeable future would make people look at me as if they've seen a madman."
2194,2014-10-25 20:55:21,"I confess that I'm taking 21 credits this semester as a senior while applying to grad school, and will take another 21 next semester. Throughout my Wash U career I have never taken less than 18 credits. Same as the post (forgot it's number) on how much he/she wish people to stop judging because he/she is taking 12 credits, I really wish people to stop judging because I'm taking more than the average 15. I even had a professor who kicked me out of his lab because I was taking 18 credits the next semester (and my class load never got in the way of finishing lab work. Never.). After he let me back in the lab this semester, I accidentally told him I am taking 21 credits, and he lectured me for a full 45 mins on how I should go out and have fun and actually ""live a life"".

This drives me mad. Okay I am not the party and drink type, and I have never been to any party-party nor taste a sip of alcohol at Wash U. But that is my personal choice and I'm simply not a party person. I have a significant other, I spent a reasonable (maybe not) chunk of time playing video games and board games, I have finished a 10K and am preparing for a half marathon, and while I am indeed a little socially awkward, I do not have any problems with socializing with people or doing interviews. And above all, I am having a lot of fun at Wash U. I can graduate by the end of junior year but j choose to stay for senior year just because I love life here at Wash U and really don't want to leave. After all, I'm taking a lot of credits because I want to learn a lot of things outside my major which I probably will have a hard time finding a chance to learn post graduation, and these classes constantly make my day.
Calling for a bit more of understanding of personal choice from another side of story I guess."
2195,2014-10-25 20:46:22,"I just got a hug from my professor, and it was one of the kindest gestures I've received from a professor. I had spent the past hour crying in his office (because of life stress, not his class), and he tried to give me advice and encouragement as best he could. Before he had to leave, he asked if there was anything more I wanted to ask, and I asked if I could have a hug. He hugged me and said everything was going to be ok. I joked that I would have asked sooner, but I didn't think professors were allowed to hug students. He said he didn't think they were, but he'd make an exception for the circumstances. I get that those kind of rules exist for a reason, but I'm glad there are those who will bend the rules when someone is in need. And I'm really touched that a professor would take so much time to make sure I'm ok even though I'm just one of many students who's taken his class."
2196,2014-10-24 18:55:24,"I confess that I'm not going to WILD for very logical reasons--Icona Pop is not my jam and standing in a crowd for hours is not my idea of fun. My relationship with music is a private thing I like to immerse myself in alone. Yet even though I feel like I am justified in not going, I feel this weird shame, like some sort of social outcast simply because I'm not going and the majority of my class is. Hmmm. It's quite strange. Fortunately, my roommate wasn't feeling it from WILD this year either and we're going to have a relaxing evening inside. At least I know I'm not alone in feeling this way."
2197,2014-10-24 17:04:25,"Being a PhD student at WashU makes me feel quite lonely most of the time. It is especially separated from the student community when you stay in Med School campus everyday. When I was back home from work, I just did not have people to talk to. I was very outgoing a person at my college period. But now I become more and more silent. I always wanted to make new friends and hang out with them. But I just did not have a chance to meet people, which is really sad. It takes another three or four years for me to graduate and I really don't want such situation to last that long. Really hope someone can help me with that."
2198,2014-10-24 16:53:26,"I'm annoyed that SHS Mental Health Services is so backlogged because it's hard to schedule an appointment to switch medications, but then I realize it means a lot of students are also struggling with depression and it makes me feel better, if only for a little bit."

2200,2014-10-24 16:42:29,"Working with the University has opened my eyes. Individually everyone is a great person, but something about the institution as a whole makes people act funny. For example don't blame STS for shitty wifi in classes. It's the artsci and engineering deans  that decided to not budget for new routers. B- school dean thought that wifi was important. Also they place those routers strategically. There is a reason that you don't get wifi in crow/louderman until you get out of the room."

2202,2014-10-24 16:23:34,"Compliments Club does nothing but make me feel objectified,annoyed,and uncomfortable. I avoid the underpass on Friday afternoons at all cost because of them. I have dealt with major insecurity issues my entire life and the way that they yell at me and ""compliment"" superficial things only increases my anxiety and nervousness. The way they present themselves comes off as extremely superficial and attention seeking. I understand the purpose of the club, but they need to realize that not all good intentions reap positive outcomes. I don't think they're bad people or have bad intentions, but j also don't think that their intentions are translated in the best ways. It would be more meaningful to express a compliment to someone outside of a two hour time span once a week while holding a poster advertisement."
2203,2014-10-24 03:12:35,"I love my Boyfriend but he is really lazy. He would rather watch Anime, play his X-Box or  sleep all day before actually wanting to get work done. I am really ambitious and think about my future everyday and it is difficult being with someone who doesn't have those ""hustler""/ ambitious qualities. I've talked about it with him month after month and he'll change for a week and then go back to doing work at the last minute (causing low grades) forgetting to take care of important business related things and not being there for me and motivating me just like I motivate him. It's gotten to the point where I basically told him he needs to delete his Anime apps on his phone, put up the X-box and bring up important things in our relationship. We've agreed that until he can start acting like an adult he needs to put childish things aside, however, he keeps asking me if he can watch TV or play the game etc etc. I feel like a mother who has to babysit a child. I can't sit here and let him ruin his life but I also don't want to feel like a mother. I see all these other ambitious guys and I wish he would be ambitious like them...He helps me to see the other side of life other than work but then again he doesn't work hard enough to improve his own life. I feel like this is a representation of what it will be like in the future if we stay together. I love him but I think I deserve a man..not a child...when I tried to tell him we needed a break so he could get his stuff together he cried and well..we're still together..I don't think I wanted to completely break it off either but I'm not sure what to do."
2204,2014-10-24 03:44:37,"I confess that I wish I had a less noticeable appearance. I would be perfectly happy being completely ignored, but everytime I go outside, people always discuss how attractive they find me. Every single time, despite what I'm wearing or doing. Frankly, it makes me so uncomfortable and I would much rather be invisible. I know many people wish for this attention and I should be grateful, but it is sincerely becoming a hinderance. I would trade my looks for a better brain in a heartbeat."
2205,2014-10-24 03:57:38,My boyfriend is twice my size. And 5 times as strong. When I get upset at him I hit him .. A lot... He doesn't hit back because he doesn't want to hurt me.. But I think this is abuse.. I think I need anger management. I do actually hurt him sometimes. This is for anyone who believes men can't be physically abused by women in a relationship.
2206,2014-10-24 03:42:40,"I don't have friends here. I used to have accompanies, but I figured out  that I don't actually enjoy spending time with them: I can't get the real conversations I want from normal friends, and I get more and more frustrated with their company. Therefore I deserted myself, yet I do feel lonely: I literally have no conversations expect for the necessary interactions in class with classmates and professors.

I went through a bad week, and today is especially terrible: I went to bed at 6 a.m. the day before yesterday, haven't slept at all yesterday, and this evening, just when I thought I could finally have a break, I discovered that one of my professors, who I really like and admire, is actually furious about me and labeled me ""the most disrespectful student seen in her 18 teaching years"". I was in horror, since I never meant anything disrespectful, and I am just so ashamed and frustrated that  I spent an hour lying on the floor between the shelves in the library. I was just broken down for a while. I cried a little bit about this, then a lot about my whole messed up life this semester. Yet when I returned home, my suit mates don't even bother to say hi, just as always. We had some not-so-pleasant conversations about a box of shared eggs, and neither of them noticed that I am dejected and apparently have just cried on my way home.

I am also struggling academically, which is my own fault, but sometimes I feel I am so broken down inside that it is incredibly hard to muster the mental strength required to survive Wash U.

I guess things WILL turn better: not actually better, but more and more bearable, as I will get used to it as time passes. Thank you for reading this: just imagining about people reading my words gives me strength to pull through tonight."

I get A's or high B's in my classes. I've worked in more labs than most people my age, been published, and I have a large group of friends to be around.

I'm well liked by the people that know me and I'm the most outgoing of my close friends. I'm also the one they trust to talk about all of their problems. They trust me. I feel like I should be able to tell they care about me.

The life I have right now should be perfect and yet I just feel empty. When I try to talk to my friends about my problems, they tell me to stop being bitter. When I talk to my parents, they tell me that I have had a better life than most and that I should get over it. They all treat my problems as jokes; conversation pieces to be had over dinner. They treat my feelings as after thoughts and simple issues just because I help them solve their problems so easily. It is easy to be logical for someone else. It is hard to be so logical when all you hear is that your problems are insignificant.

I throw myself into my work to make my emotions numb. They tell me to keep busy and the pain will go away. They tell me that if I'm busy, there will be no time to feel pain. Well I've been busy. I've built a résumé longer than half my college essays. I've worked out so often that my feet have bleed and I've passed out. I've surrounded myself with people that ""care"" and yet I feel alone.

I feel alone because I have yet to find a friend who sees me for how I am. I feel alone because the people who tell me they care treat me like I'm insane. They make me feel different but tell me I'm just like them. If I was like them, then why don't they treat me like a person and less like a dog. Someone they can call to them when they want to talk, but they expect to take care of herself when they are done.

I've lost trust in people. I trust strangers more than I trust ""friends"". I tell strangers how I feel, yet I don't trust their sympathy. I think that if they get to know me, then they will treat me like my ""friends"".

I don't want sympathy for what I'm saying here because I know that I won't really be helped by it at this point. What I want is for this to never happen to someone else. My ""friends will never see how I feel because I now hide my feelings in sarcasm. I hide my sadness in journals. I am too afraid to get close to people, so I now just move through life numb to sympathy and indifferent to the problems of others. I want people to look at their friends and remember some very simple things. Extroversion is not always happiness. Sometimes sarcasm hides truth. Your words have meaning. Sticks and stones may break bones, but words can kill people. Depression has many faces and sometimes it's a smile."
2213,2014-10-23 15:21:52,"I confess that whenever someone laughs at me for saying that the B school is hard  I get slightly depressed. Their comments about ""B-School Pre-School"" etc. have really started to get to me. When people say things like this I cannot help bur question my own abilities. I'm struggling in the B school. I think that it's difficult. By saying that it's a slacker major, it makes me feel like I'm not even close to being as smart as any of the pre-med or engineering students. I'm not in the B school because I heard that it was easy. I'm in it because it's something that I am truly interested in and passionate about. I hate being told that the B school is easy because it makes me feel dumb for not even being able to do well there. Why should other people be able to tell me whether or not my major (my future career) is a ""real subject""?"
2214,2014-10-23 15:52:53,"I confess that before I came to this school, I believed that the world was 6,000 years old. I was raised in a conservative muslim family, and I was told that if I ""strayed from the path"" that I could not be saved. I have always been fearful of retribution in the afterlife, even after I secretly became an atheist, because I have been brainwashed my whole life that apostates deserve damnation. I just want to thank the school for enlightening me and making one less ignorant person in this world. Many things I have learned would be considered obvious by most people, but for me were huge leaps. I am a new person now, and I have this school and my new friends to thank for that."
2215,2014-10-23 02:51:55,"The only Wash U Admirers post I've every gotten, I wrote about myself."
2216,2014-10-23 01:14:56,"I've been wanting to get this off my chest for a while but haven't known exactly how to say it until now.

When I was little I was spanked on a regular basis by my quite muscular dad on a regular basis, at my mom's request, even for small things such as spilling milk. My mom was fundamentalist and got angry with my grandma when she gave me a pack of Pokémon cards at age 6, because Pokémon is short for Pocket Monsters and monsters were evil (along with aliens, witches, ghosts, zombies, and magic powers). She would often rip pages out of magazines before giving them to me, not even letting me see the back of the page, because of ""demonic"" content such as a Harry Potter ad.

I was homeschooled all of K-12 even though I wished to be in a more typical setting and frequently made said wishes known verbally. My only real chances at socialization in my earlier years was a weekly church service, and my mom's reasoning for keeping me homeschooled (as opposed to a Christian private school) was that I was ""inexperienced in dealing with other people"".

My biggest desire until age 12 was to be on a Little League team (my dad had been in the minor leagues and I looked up to him). I asked my parents many times, even offering to pay the $300 fee myself with money I had saved up for years from gifts from my grandma, but was denied due to being ""inexperienced socially"". Instead my mom took away my favorite video games (all E-rated, another of her demands which continued well into my teenage years) and didn't give them back for as long as 4 years. Everything seemed fine on the outside, but that was just because the few times I saw other kids I was so excited at the relative freedom that I literally couldn't be sad. But when I got home I would cry myself to sleep, wishing I could be anyone else.

I got my family's old computer put in my room at 13 and promptly went around their parental control system. I would still go ""on the radar"" and go to an a site they approved of a couple of times a day so my parents would see it on their e-mail record. About every hour my mom would walk into my room and I would have to go to Task Manager and even occasionally pull an intentional BSOD.

The next year my mom changed churches because the youth group was too ""worldly"" with their mentions of Myspace and YouTube. A month later my favorite MMO virtual world (a very family-friendly one that she approved of) closed down. With most of my video games still gone and most of my avenues for contact with others demolished, I attempted suicide twice but failed.

When I was 16 I was removed from my last social group (a homeschooling co-op) because my mom hated that grades K-12 were all together (it was ""just wrong"", she said). For the next 2.5 years, I saw no friends in real life and had problems focusing and severe brain fog along with total emotionlessness outside of a constant listless sadness. At times I would read anger-inducing websites for many hours just to experience a few seconds of SOME kind of emotion.

My mom wanted me to go to a local religious university, but I had higher ideals. I was able to push through my brain fog enough to learn computer programming and suggest to my mom that my résumé might look better if I did a science project. This project was intentionally security-related to aid me in my secondary plan -- to get my mom to stop watching me on the computer. I convinced her (without saying any words to this affect at all) that I was doing a very important project on the side for the government and nobody could see me do it. Luckily it worked, and she never found out about the glitch in the parental controls.

I actually WAS doing a side project, but not for the government -- instead I worked from 5 AM to midnight every weekday to do school (I sped up the DVDs to save time), study for the SAT/ACT, begin to fill out college applications, and (mostly) work on a major web programming project that would boost my résumé and make me some money. After getting perfect scores on my entrance exams, my parents (mostly at my dad's urging) started to look at actually decent universities for me.

Luckily, I got into some of them -- including Wash U, which I am now attending. I feel a lot happier here on occasion, even though it's taken me years to adjust to the relative culture shock of no longer being in the bubble I was raised in. Still, nothing is perfect... all those years of pretending to be hiding something while actually hiding something else have gotten so deep into me that I developed pretty bad social anxiety, and the intensity of my course load doesn't help with that (when I'm actually busy, I often say no to things and then worry that the person thought I didn't want to be with them). Also, all the time of my parents berating me for every little thing has resulted in me being very afraid and paranoid of doing anything remotely ""rebellious"" or anything I'm not already good at, even though I personally want to live a more exciting life, and sadly my paranoia has probably led a lot of people to think I'm personally strongly conservative when actually I just have a lot of irrational fears rooted from a time when going even a little bit ""wild"" would have resulted in serious harm to me.

Up until now, I have only told one friend about all of this -- I even avoided telling my grandmother when she babysat me as a kid out of fear that my parents would punish me for doing so (which they had specifically threatened to do if I said anything). Incidentally, my mom still claims credit for getting me into Wash U, even though her plans would have prevented me in multiple ways from coming here."
2217,2014-10-22 23:03:57,"I know many already mentioned this, but I feel like the engineering school could teach us a lot better than what it's doing now. Mechanical engineering especially. I'm not making excuses - I get pretty good grades and I work hard, but the truth is the school just fails to teach effectively except for maybe a couple of professors per major. Frankly it feels like the school is throwing me a shovel and a pick to build a castle. Erecting new buildings doesn't help us. Please invest in a better curriculum."
2218,2014-10-22 23:42:58,"After a couple months of changing doses and medications my psychiatrist finally found the perfect medication and dose for my SSRI. I feel like I'm on top of the world. I feel like the person I was before all of this shit happened. I just want to tell everyone how happy I'm right now!!

I just want to thank the people on here for putting up with the depression posts- people like us sometimes don't have a support network other than our therapists and it feels good at times to vent out problems that we feel. Thanks for listening/caring about one of my posts a while back it does mean a lot."
2219,2014-10-22 18:21:11,"I hate it when people judge me for only taking 12 credit hours this semester. They always scoff when they hear it, or call me a slacker, or tell me that my life is so easy and I have to reason to complain about school. The reason why I am taking a light load is because I had lots of mental health problems this summer, and I didn't want to overwhelm myself with classes that might push me back over the edge. On top of it all, I have to go to 3 and a half hours of therapy each week, plus 2 hours total drive time which is another time stressor in my schedule. By not taking a ton of credits  I made the right choice for my health and people should not judge something that they don't know the reasons behind. Why do people even brag about taking huge course loads in the first place? Congratulations on never getting enough sleep and always being stressed out! If that's something you're proud of, then fine, but don't try to make me feel guilty or feel like a slacker for taking care of myself and my health."
2220,2014-10-22 18:09:12,"Dear Large Corporate Business,

I am humbled and surprised that you are giving me the opportunity to interview for your internship. As an Arts & Sciences student with a non-quantitative-material-heavy major, I understand why you may have been hesitant. You have a sea of eager B-School students who have been preparing for your case interview since they emerged from the prenatal executive suite. As for me, I leisurely browsed CareerLink, kind of drunk and wearing boxers, and threw in an application because my mom said I should ""probably get an internship next summer.""

But alas, I think what you do is interesting, and I do want to work for you--and with some training (that you aptly offer in the ""internship description""), I think I have what it takes. I may not have taken a math class here, but give me two angle measures of a triangle and I'll be damned if I can't find the third one. I may not know what a case interview is, but I will spend a lot of time preparing for one just in ""case"" you hire me. I am good at understanding people and communicating my ideas, and while my course of study might be unorthodox, it makes me DIFFERENT from the business majors and has given me a unique perspective that might end up being valuable to you.

Also, I will be studying abroad next semester, so if you offer me your internship this fall, I will be able to fuck around in Europe and not worry about this in the spring. So please, Large Corporate Business, take a chance on me. I promise I won't let you down.

Sincerely,
Liberal Arts Major"

2222,2014-10-22 18:08:15,"I regret choosing Wash U. My major here is not exactly one of the school's flagship departments, and to be honest a lot of the courses have been taught awfully. No, I'm not using bad teaching as an excuse for bad grades because at risk of sounding arrogant I don't need to; my grades have been quite good. What frustrates me is that I could have gone to my home state's main public university, saved my parents tens of thousands of dollars, and gotten a computer science degree that was just as if not more competent than the one I'm working on here. 

Unfortunately I didn't know that I would want to study this major when I was going into college, and, like the dumbass that I am, just chose the most ""prestigious"" school that I got into.  Obviously Wash U is a great place to be, and I'm very grateful for the opportunity my family has given me by getting me here financially. Given the chance though, I would go back and choose differently in a heartbeat. Hindsight really is 20/20."
2223,2014-10-22 03:42:20,"I didn't deserve to be accepted here. The only reason I feel like I was is because I am currently paying full tuition, with no scholarships (given from WashU). Although WashU was my dream school, I definitely do not feel smart enough to go here. I have constantly struggled to do well in classes, and have NEVER felt confident coming out of an exam relating to my major, or for my core classes. 

As an engineer, sometimes I feel like maybe it is just this particular path I chose to take, but I honestly think that I would struggle in any other major just as much because of the general rigor or this institution. I constantly feel guilty because my parents are paying so much for me to attend, and I am always letting them down with my academic performance. It may seem like I am just not working hard enough, but my friends criticize me actually for how much I am constantly working and studying. I feel incredibly lucky to go here everyday because WashU is everything and more I hoped it would be. I just constantly let myself and my parents down because deep down, I know I should not have been accepted in the first place."

I went to the career center twice last year, but when I told the advisors that I had never had a job they just looked at me, almost disgusted and said ""Charmed life."" both times. It made me really uncomfortable.

I am very fortunate, but the way the advisors just kind of sent me away saying that they couldn't help and I should just scoop ice-cream over the summer so that I could put something on the resume at all. I did a summer program instead that really taught me amazing things and was an incredible experience. But now I've still never had a ""real job"" and I'm so embarrassed that I'm scared to go back to get help trying to make my embarrassingly short resume into something I could actually use to apply for internships."

2234,2014-10-20 09:07:37,"The whole idea of it being okay to call someone ""privileged"" makes me mad, and mind you I'm a minority saying this. The fact is you haven't got a clue about the personal struggles and battles every individual has had to go through in their life whether they be white, black, poor, rich, straight, gay, male, female, etc. You really have no idea about the burdens that they have had to carry and there could be so many: dealing with disabilities, illness, family members with disabilities and illness, relationship problems, etc. And you honestly can't say that someone has gone through more ""hard times"" than another person based on their socio-economic status, gender or race. That's not being fair because again, A) You will never know everyone's entire story and B) how do you get away with calling a rich person ""privileged"" in comparison to a poor person who grew up in the getto? What if that wealthy person had to watch their loved one deteriorate from Parkinson's or something? I don't see how you can compare extremely painful hardships of two people, much less hardships you're ignorant about, and veto one as ""privileged"". How can you sleep with yourself at night?"

After graduation, I'm happy to see that the activism-for-attention pretty much stops. No, I'm not discrediting real activism, but it would be ignorant to say there are no people at WashU who are claiming certain things concerning their race for attention.

After current students' graduations, it will be interesting to see who continues on their protests, anger, and comments, and who simply stops and will be quiet because they are ""too busy"" or realize that the area they are in and their coworkers in the job actually aren't racist, even though strong racism continues elsewhere. I'm not saying this as a challenge or question, but just a true rhetorical query that I will be looking out for.

I confess that I would appreciate it if you would please stop yelling. You have every right to your opinions, but do not try to drag in those of us who are not interested.  I would ask you to look at what progress you have made.  On campus, any progress has been minimal, and clearly there is a significant apathetic crowd if previous posts are anything to go by (or look at the Peabody movement, or rather the lack thereof).  It is understandable to want to change the way things are, and I am by no means saying that you shouldn't do that.  I'm just saying you won't do it in college.  If you want to change anyone's mind or actually communicate in a meaningful way to people who have the ability to change things, then put in the time now to be in that position later in life; be realistic with what you can actually accomplish now.  Go to law school, or become a lobbyist, or learn marketing strategies so you can help a rally or something.

I appreciate the sentiment, but you are doing both us and your cause no good by trying to stir this up right now.  Whether we agree on this or not is irrelevant, as we are not in the position to make any sort of meaningful change.  You could say that we will eventually be, but who is to say that a facebook post is going to stick (hypocritical, I know), and who says it won't make things worse, and who says it won't do more harm through polarization than good?

I can't stop you, but I would ask you to consider how you're spending your time arguing on WashU confessions about matters upon which we have a minimal impact, and evaluate whether posting inflammatory statements and attempting to rile up campus is not only a good use of our time, but if it might be causing more harm than good.

For those of you who read all the way to the end before deciding to bash this post, thank you, I appreciate your taking the time to understand where we're coming from."
2259,2014-10-18 02:06:28,"Posts #1562, 1561, 1560 and 1559 absolutely blew my mind away though I'm too scared to comment or ""like"" any of them. But seriously you guys, the four of you gave me hope for this country when I thought there was none. We need to take back freedom of speech and have real debates without being afraid of the PC police! I am truly inspired."
2260,2014-10-18 01:00:29,"Sometimes, I get really jealous when I see people studying hard. I don't know where they find the motivation to do so. Getting out of bed for the day is a daily struggle for me, so I feel really inadequate when everyone else seems to be working so hard. I used to be able to work hard, but now I can't. And I feel really guilty, which makes it even harder to leave bed."
2261,2014-10-18 01:47:32,"I was pretty receptive to this whole Mike Brown thing until protesters started shouting ""fuck the police"" and everybody decided to defend Vonderrick Myers after he fired on an officer (sorry, you can't shoot bullets with a sandwich). No wonder cops are afraid of black communities, I don't even blame them anymore. If people are serious about improving relationships between black communities and white police officers, maybe they should recognize the police killed in the line of duty as an important contributing factor in the conflict instead of rallying hundreds of people to spit on and threaten officers (not to mention loot businesses- these people aren't being productive in resolving the issues of their own neighborhoods). But if I ever put my name on this I would never get a job, so good thing the SJW thought police are there to make sure that I'm quiet about my disagreements instead of being open to candid conversation that might actually change my mind."
2262,2014-10-18 01:29:34,"As a POC, I think all this white privilege discussion, while not inaccurate, hurts our community. It gives people an easy out if they aren't successful and teaches them to pin their struggles on white people. Yeah it's harder for us to be successful, and yeah a lot of that is because of systemic racism, but it's possible for us to take advantage of a society that's working proactively to integrate pro-minority policies, and constantly bringing up discussions that divide us don't do anything to help the problem. If anything they just make white people pissy and defensive, even if for PCs sake they outwardly go along with it. Not to mention that policies like AA only degrade the value of any achievement today..."

Let me make this clear, just because my skin color may be a shade different than yours does not mean I need help standing up for myself. I can take care of myself. I don't need a buffer or a special sign or any other kind of hand out to protect me from the world. My ethnicity doesn't make me a handicap. Offering me a ""safety zone"" based on my ethnicity is like giving me training wheels for life. It is the most ultimate form of racism; and I stand by this so fervently that I will comment and attach my name to it if this gets posted."
2265,2014-10-17 20:14:38,Confession #1553 really boosted my confidence as a black woman on this campus. I confess that Ive always felt an insecurity about being black and have always assumed that Im unappealing. Im curious if other black girls have felt the same way but i have never asked any of my friends... but usually if i ever find any guy attractive I conclude that id never have a chance simply because im black. I think it's all a result of where and how I was raised... but idk if im the only one who feels this way..
2266,2014-10-17 20:15:40,I confess that it pisses me off that the wifi so often doesn't work in the bathrooms on campus. Pooping with no wifi is boring.

2269,2014-10-17 11:50:43,"I confess that it gets easier to say goodbye to my life at home when I leave for college. I've just established a life here at WashU and am happy with it. When I miss home, I tend to just miss my family and pets but I don't think about my home friends as much. In fact, I feel a lot closer to my friends here than to some of my high school friends. Does anyone else feel the same way?"
2270,2014-10-17 11:32:45,"I confess that I think that 90% of the black girls here are absolutely GORGEOUS, but I just don't interact with many. Not even to exoticize anyone  but I simply want a black girl friend."
2271,2014-10-17 11:19:48,"I confess that I judge people based on their number of profile picture ""likes"" on Facebook... the more they have, the shallower they are (especially if they always post them on Sunday evenings)."
2272,2014-10-17 11:00:49,"I confess that the one thing that annoys me more than ANYTHING at this school is when people think they're somehow better than other students here because they went to some private high school where the tuition was higher than that of WashU.

It's normal to have pride in your high school, but they drop the names of their schools in normal conversations and just expect that everyone knows exactly what they're talking about. It doesn't matter if your school is the 4th best boarding school in the country. I still had never heard of it until I saw the 7 shirts you're constantly wearing.

In my opinion, the quality of education is no higher whatsoever than what you could get from a standard AP or IB program. I mean, it's all fundamentals anyway. It's more likely that your parents spent the $40,000/year for the sole purpose of getting you to conform to their ideal lifestyle. The same uniforms every day, the same way of thinking about the world, etc.

I'm honestly so happy I didn't have the opportunity to go anywhere but a large public high school. It forced me to become more self-sufficient, brought me all types of experiences, taught me to question everything and think for myself rather than blindly accept what generations before you have laid down as fact, and it allowed me to be a kid."

2276,2014-10-16 21:34:56,"I have very few memories of my dad while we had a good relationship. One of them is very simple. Every Sunday he would visit and bring me Starbucks. I didn’t like really strong coffee or anything (I was in middle school), but fall was always a special time. It was always a tradition for him to bring me a pumpkin spice latte and something sweet like a scone or a cookie. The good times didn’t last for very long after that, and now he’s dead. So call me a “basic bitch” for getting something pumpkin flavored. I don’t really care. Because for some reason that’s what fall means to me, and it helps me remember the good times I had with him before he ruined my life and his."

2278,2014-10-16 18:42:58,"I'm ashamed because I have feelings for a guy (who probably doesn't feel the same way) and it is making me doubt my long-term long-distance relationship. I've been with this guy for two years, but I like someone else, and it makes me feel guilty. He is the only guy I have dated, but I feel like I should be with other guys too just to see what it is like."
2279,2014-10-16 18:46:11,"I feel incredibly lonely here. I don't seem to fit in with any groups of friends that I've hung out with and I feel like an outsider to everyone. Everyone suggests to join campus groups but I've looked through them and I frankly feel like I wouldn't fit in. I don't really associate any of the ethnic groups, I can't sing, I'm not athletic, I'm not a business major or premed, etc. This was a huge problem for me in high school as well and I had very few close friends, never dated anyone, and never had a friend group that I really fit in with.

2280,2014-10-16 17:51:12,"I secretly wish that I would appear on the Wash U admirers admirers page. Is it so wrong to want to be noticed/ thought of? I feel invisible to guys/girls, which kinda tugs at my self-confidence."
2281,2014-10-16 17:34:14,"I confess that I am disgusted by the ""hater"" culture on campus. People say they're open and accepting, but the second someone has a controversial, usually non-leftist opinion, they switch to saying, ""Keep your opinion to yourself, nobody wants it here"" or ""You're just racist/sexist/homophobic/ableist/misogynistic."" or ""Stop being a hater."" I've also noticed this passive aggressiveness about it, saying ""Thanks"" after they give their opinion, as if it is law, or posting a smiley face with a really nasty reply.

We should be accepting of all ideas and open to listening to those with different ones. Many of us grew up in liberal homes, but some of us also came from extremely conservative ones. So far, on campus, the only people I've seen allowed to express their opinions without ridicule are the former. As someone whose parents actually were racist/homophobic/sexist, I would like to try to understand different groups of people, but I really don't want to associate with the people who are oppressing me into not sharing my background/beliefs unless I've made a conversion and completely denounce my past."

Some days, I'm so somber about 'bae' that I go to www.google.com/images and look up pictures of biscuits, gravy, and cornbread (among other viands) in order to assuage my pain. The people I've met at school so far, are pretty chill, but have yet to surpass the food's magnificence. Maybe one day I'll be okay, but until then..."
2283,2014-10-15 23:44:20,"This is very dark, but I confess that a lot of people ask me why my hair is short (as opposed to pictures of me when it was down to my hips) and I tell them I had to cut it off after an accident. But the truth is that two years ago  I got into a fight with my boyfriend and he grabbed me, grabbed my hair and chopped it off with a scissors. It was an abusive relationship and I left him back in our home state... I barely call. He still thinks we're together but luckily I know he can't afford to come looking for me. I feel free as a bird. Glad that's over."

I confess I feel like I'm missing out on the ""real"" WashU experience that unites everybody here. Your freshmen floor caters events for like 'the first gen chem exam' and calc exam and things like that that I wasnt a part of. People on here complain about the 'competitive atmosphere' at washu and the obsession over grades and I've never felt that. I want to be in the loop, but I'm somehow accidentally too far outside the mainstream of the washu experience to understand what everybody's talking about."

Sometimes I wonder how will people react if I call out their names on street."
2287,2014-10-15 21:13:25,"I know I'm not as smart as a majority of my peers here. Friends tell me I'm much smarter than I think I am but the fact of the matter is that I'm not. I'm already done stewing over it, I had that existential crisis winter break of freshman year. I am not as smart as my friends and am going to have to try a bit harder, and even then might not get the same results. I have to come to grips with that, I have accepted it, and compartmentalized it. What I cannot handle and what I confess it this: I hate what this school has made me: a poser. I hate that I have to act smart in order to fit in here. I hate that I have to act like I know what I'm talking about when the truth is I have the tiniest idea. I hate the whole try hard atmosphere and I hate the obsession with grades and people's incessant whining. Sorry for the rant but this has been cooking for a while, just like my nerves. Y'all are gonna give me a fucking ulcer. I'm over this, man."
2288,2014-10-15 20:03:26,"I confess that I'm having a lot of trouble fitting in at Wash U so a friend advised me to join one of the ethnic associations on campus. I had a very traditional upbringing unlike most Americans and I want to bond with other students that had that too. But my multicultural heritage stops me from fitting into any cultural stereotype.

I lived in South America with my mother but we were known as the ""European Persians"" living within that Latino community. I speak Spanish but I have nothing in common with any of my Latino peers (no offense). However I don't have an arabic or muslim last name either. My first name is portuguese and my last name is Hungarian, because of my father.  On top of that, I have much stronger Native American and Mongolian features than anyone else in my family. What one earth do I join? Would I be made fun of if I joined the MSA? Should I join Ashoka? Or simply the Latino Association, despite not really identifying with them even though I'm quote on quote ""hispanic""? :/"
2289,2014-10-15 17:31:28,"I confess that I'm mostly happy with all parts of my college experience but one; sex. Simply put, I'm bad at it. When I'm sober I finish way too quickly, and one or two drinks gives me unconquerable whiskey-dick. I have a fairly high sex drive, and the few times I've been successful I've enjoyed it immensely, but for some reason the physical process doesn't work for me. It's gotten to the point where I start intentionally sabotaging any relationship (or one night stand) that looks like its going to lead to sex, because every time I disappoint a girl it just compounds the problem. I don't really have a point to this confession, but goddamn does it suck to miss out on a huge aspect of college because of something I can't seem to control."
2290,2014-10-15 16:24:29,I think Fontbonne has a better mascot than WashU.
2291,2014-10-15 16:04:32,I think I might be addicted to weed.  I've started smoking daily and even though like I need it daily and I have addiction symptoms but it's just so much a relaxer to me that it helps me start each day that much more happy.  I'm not sure this is a bad thing and I feel like without it It would be harder to stay sane at Wash U.  Also I feel like my personality has changed for the better because of it.
2292,2014-10-15 16:36:34,"I confess that I agree with posts like #1529, #1526, and some of the other controversial/unpopular posts on here, but I'm too afraid to ""like"" them. Honestly I'm afraid of the judgmental backlash, and I have several friends who I know would never speak to me again if I did. Anyway, it's still good to know that some people at Wash U still have some common sense, even if they can't express it publicly."
2293,2014-10-15 16:20:35,"I didn't ""like"" confession #1529 because of fear of retribution. Sometimes, people really are just petty."
2294,2014-10-14 23:01:37,"Sometimes I get really annoyed with the WashU population. I don't get why everything anyone says or does has to turn into a critical analysis of our ""perpetuation of the patriarchy"" or a new strain of racism or whatever other politically incorrect social issue we want to get riled up about. Sometimes things just exist and happen. Although there could be some underlying wrong, we don't have to consistently bring it to light. I get being an activist about things, but let's breathe and spend time on what events and situations that really matter. Let's stop being petty and try just being happy for two seconds."
2295,2014-10-14 23:10:38,"I confess that my RAs this year are awful. They haven't asked for any resident input, and just spontaneously run programs about things that are important to them, and then when nobody shows up, they wander the dorm knocking on doors.

To all you RAs out there who aren't getting the turnout you want: maybe you should ask your residents what THEY want to do, instead of putting on the programs that YOU want."

2297,2014-10-14 20:15:41,"I confess that I am against the protest going on at SLU, as well as anyone here at WashU that is still defending Vonderitt Myers, a man who evidence now shows is guilty of shooting at the police.

I have many friends that support this movement, and I sympathize with them, as well as the countless others that want nothing more than to be able to feel safe in their communities. But Vonderitt Myers was not an innocent bystander that was attacked by vicious police. He's not a martyr. He's a criminal that purposely chose to shoot at a police officer, and I cannot support anyone who stands behind him.

We should all be able to live without the fear of being targeted by those police that are meant to protect us. But what this movement fails to realize is that the police act the way they do because they too are scared. They're scared that they could be on a routine patrol and be suddenly shot at and killed solely because they're a police officer. They're scared because they walk by crowds of people everyday that want them dead. They're scared that one man with a gun can take them away from their families in an instant. People like Vonderitt Myers only make that fear stronger. That is why Myers is a detriment to this movement, and anyone who wishes real progress to be made should denounce him and his actions."
2298,2014-10-14 19:39:42,"Am I the only person who has periodically decided not to do his/her homework because it was just too difficult? Sometimes, the culmination of the overwhelming workload and the abstruse material have forced me to capitulate. I want to be diligent, but my GPA has to suffer at times so that I can maintain sanity."
2299,2014-10-14 17:00:43,I confess that I'm pretty sure my blood is turning into diet coke.
2300,2014-10-14 16:00:45,"Today, one of my old high school friends told me the only reason he's studying what he's studying and motivated to do it is because of the talks we have. He said that my encouragement over the past couple of years through brief Facebook conversations has meant everything. Now I realize that no matter what happens on my exam today, I at least have that. I think inspiring someone has to be my biggest accomplishment up until this point in my life. I'm not saying I'm some incredible mentor because in reality all I did was say ""you've go this"" and ""I believe in you."" I'm just saying that it's good to know how much the little things you do for a person helps."
2301,2014-10-14 16:00:48,"I confess that, thanks to my dad's emotionally degrading reactions to any small failure on my part, I almost break down in tears anytime I think about asking a girl on a date. I'm so convinced that she'll say no (whoever she is) that I can barely bring myself to think about it, which I then regard as a failure on my part. I feel like a boy because I'm in tears of fear as I write this, even though I'll be 23 in a few months."
2302,2014-10-14 16:00:49,"The fact that a girl always wins Mr. WashU really annoys me. Why does WashU have to be so politically correct and fix ""problems"" that don't necessarily exist. There is still discrimination against women (just like there is discrimination against men and really everyone), but the guys that perform in Mr. WashU and the guys that watch it aren't thinking, ""THIS SHOW IS THE CONTINUANCE OF THE PATRIARCHAL SOCIETY. LONG LIVE MEN!"" I respect the women that perform in Mr. WashU but can we please retain some normality at this university. If we get caught up over water bottles, male talents shows, and reusable to-go boxes then we are going to miss the true problems in society."
2303,2014-10-14 02:04:52,"I met a European friend on some penpal website 2 years and 9.5 months ago, and we've been chatting and writing messages to each other on a semi-regular basis.

At the beginning we used to talk quite often but lately we've been talking less as she's gotten very busy with work, which I'm cool with. The problem for me emerged when I noticed she's online multiple times a day almost daily, but it usually takes at least 2-3 days (often up to a week) for her to answer something that would only take a couple minutes. I asked her about it, and got no answer back.

I haven't socialised a lot so my idea of ""friends"" may not be close to what's been socially accepted. But I feel like one would usually want to hang out with/talk to their friends as often as possible.

Yesterday I had only enough time to just bring this up, and she said she considered me as a friend but she didn't mind if I considered as a mere acquaintance. That I believe isn't characteristic of a friend, and I somehow think that she's deceiving herself into thinking I'm her friend, but deep down I only happen to be someone she knows well. Which makes sense because we've never met in person.

But I'm also thinking I may have gotten this idea of ""friends"" all wrong and maybe I'm overreacting. I wish I never thought of all this in the first place because she's the one I got closest to in the past 8 years, and it helped me survive Wash U without friends."
2304,2014-10-14 00:15:53,My professor emailed me saying I have missed too many classes and it is going to affect my grade. I would rather just deal with the lower grade - and even that is making me beat myself up and feel very anxious - than ever admit the reason I am absent is because my depressive tendencies and insomnia make it impossible to get out of bed sometimes.
2305,2014-10-13 23:08:55,"I'm in a long term, long distance relationship.  I'm crushing on one of my friends at school."
2306,2014-10-13 23:28:56,"Sometimes there are confessions on here that reveal an uncomfortableness with lacking dating/sexual/relationship experiences. It seems like a lot of this stems from a fear of not conforming to normalcy, of being behind in an imaginary race. I thought I'd just mention my own path because it seems like it isn't mainstream enough, you might not be aware such life choices exist. I wasn't in a relationship ever until my senior year here, I ended up sharing a bed with my bf for over a year before actually having sexual intercourse, and then we graduated and got married and now we're happy simple real world adults. Just do whatever you are comfortable with and everything works out. That is all. Don't worry about what anyone else is doing, you do you."
2307,2014-10-13 22:51:57,"I went to a small, private high school, and most of the kids there were white. I was one of the only Indian kids in my entire school. Most of the students only liked other white students, and so I felt really unattractive, although when I look in the mirror I don't think I'm bad-looking.
I thought that coming here would be different, because there are so many different kinds of people. I know that it's not a right to be liked and found attractive, but I thought here would be different."
2308,2014-10-13 22:00:58,"I have Celiac disease. As great as Wash U is about dietary restrictions, it really sucks not to be able to take advantage of all the free food there is on campus and it can make it hard to relate to/hang out with my friends. They don't mean to do it but anytime they talk about trying out a new restaurant I have to check out the gluten free options and more often than not I can't eat there. I don't want to make it a big deal by saying something especially because I want them to have fun and do what they want, but everytime somebody mentions free food, or going out for dinner, or really anything about food it makes me feel (unintentionally) excluded."
2309,2014-10-13 21:17:11,"I confess us junior BMEs have become a really close bunch this semester - more than I imagined possible, mostly because we don't have the time to talk to anyone who isn't taking QP."
2310,2014-10-13 21:49:12,I went to sex in the dark with the hopes of learning more about sex but all I got out of it was how much more sexually active everyone was than me.

2311,2014-10-13 21:31:14,"I believe Darren Wilson and Michel Brown are both human beings deserving of compassion, empathy, and respect. They are not symbols, caricatures, or martyrs for a cause. They are simply persons that are as complex as any of us, with a a corresponding flaw for each time they made a person smile. I believe the best way to honor them is to approach this debate with love in our hearts, but given the current climate, I am scared to say this out loud."
2312,2014-10-13 21:49:15,I wonder if my Christian friends at Wash U would still be there for me if they knew I used to prostitute myself.
2313,2014-10-13 20:51:20,"Okay. Honest question that I'd be eviscerated for asking anyone in person.
The death of Mike Brown was obviously an unwarranted tragedy. But why are there campus protests for the death of Vonderrit Myers? He clearly wasn't innocent.
It's hard to preach that ""all lives matter"" when you choose a gun-wielding, life-threatening felon as your martyr, especially when there are no protests for the dozens of innocent black men killed every week."
2314,2014-10-13 20:16:21,"As a white student here on campus, I am absolutely disgusted and ashamed of many of my peers' responses to the protests surrounding Ferguson and Shaw, which range from clueless to ignorant to racist. As members of the St. Louis community, the lack of empathy and respect for St. Louisans who are fighting for basic equal citizenship rights is appalling. I urge everybody to have some empathy for Michael Brown and Vonderitt Myers (and countless others), at least for the sake of empathy, and to refrain from victim blaming because above all else, their families have lost their sons. To those of you who are posting things on YikYak about the protests and how you think they're stupid, try to imagine what is at stake for the protesters. I challenge you, as a WashU student, to learn something about the other side's perspective. To those of you who are posting straight up racist shit, think about how unsafe that must make your black peers feel. Be better."
2315,2014-10-13 20:06:22,"I confess that some of these recent ""the right guy won't ask me out"" type of confessions (except 1506, that shit's lame and he deserves whatever misfortune befalls him) are annoying to me. I'm extraordinarily shy, so asking you (whoever ""you"" may end up being) out would take a monumental effort that, given the not at all insignificant chance of getting rejected, just isn't worth it.

But that isn't what's annoying. The annoying thing is that, in the 21st century, you still expect us to be the ones to ask you out. Why can't you ask us out? Just because we're scared or unwilling to ask you out doesn't mean we won't say yes if you ask. We aren't (for the most part) assholes who will reject you out of hand, nor are we all sex crazed barbarians. If you know of a guy you want to ask you out, but he won't do it, ask him first. Odds are he'll say yes."
2316,2014-10-13 18:25:24,"I confess that the other night, I got hammered as a nail, then got nailed by a girl that I absolutely would have never slept with if she didn't start giving me a blow job while I was as drunk as ever and nearly passed out in my bed. I never thought I would be ""raped"" because even if both people are schwasted beyond proper decision making it seems like the guy is the one who is usually to blame.

      Anyways... I woke up the next morning, and I felt ashamed, a little annoyed at the girl and a little annoyed at my friends, but mostly just ashamed that I made the judgement call to get so drunk that I would do that. I want to say i got taken advantage of, but unless she slipped something in my drink, or had convinced me to drink more than I wanted, i can't see how I could just blame it on her. I don't want to sound insensitive towards people really beating themselves up over something like this, but in cases like this where no one was forced in any way to have sex, it feels like we the people who chose to get too drunk to make a proper decision are the ones to blame. Why should I report someone and try to get the school involved, when the obvious solution is to not to be so irresponsible with my drinking?

       Honestly, if Wash U is so concerned about date rape, maybe they should allow students to illegally use marijuana, rather than illegally drink... Shit, not only would we all be too busy watching cartoons or talking about the universe to ""rape"", but there'd be a whole lot less stomach pumping (There still may be some for the occasional over consumption of cereal), and with the money made from food services they could probably cut tuition by 10 percent."
2317,2014-10-13 18:47:25,"I confess that I don't hook up and I don't date much. I'm really shy. But last week a crush of mine in my class offered to carry my books and asked me out. It was the sweetest, most romantic thing I had ever experienced. I mean he followed through with asking me out perfectly, like I had always envisioned it.

Our first date was amazing. There was plenty of mystery and a lot of flirting; and then the second date (the next week) was even better. I don't usually like to jump into feelings. But he acted like he was crazy about me. He even said so. And honestly, everything he revealed about himself was everything I ever wanted. He talked about the future, meeting my family, and having a relationship.

Then halfway through the night he pulled me aside and told me he wasn't ""the relationship type"" and that he couldn't keep dating me because he had an open relationship with a girl who had been sleeping with him for a year.

My feelings: lead on, humiliated for showing so much public affection, foolish for believing that the guy of my dreams could even exist and stupid for thinking that something that too good to be true could really happen to me. I just want to disappear. I wish I could lock myself in my room with my pasta and my books.

It's not even about missing the guy or wishing he was mine. She can have him. I don't like liars. It's about not seeing something so fake right before my eyes. I don't think that I'll ever date again."
2318,2014-10-13 18:11:26,"I confess that I try to eat as much free food as possible, and hot damn WUSTL has been killing the free food game this semester. Shoutout to the B school for the all you can eat BBQ and all those wonderful events in Bauer. But for real, don't give out free pizza. That's lame."
2319,2014-10-13 16:09:28,I'm becoming really frustrated with the hook up culture here. Sometimes I wish a guy would just ask me out on a date. Is that so much to ask?
2320,2014-10-13 16:50:29,"I have been extremely insecure about my appearance my whole life. It is only in the last year or two that I have actually become an extremely confident person. I never saw a downside to that until I realized that the more secure I was that I am an attractive person, the more unsafe I felt as a woman. I could never relate to women who talked about not being able to walk home feeling safe or women who were tired of being harassed because I was too insecure and thought that kind of thing only happened to attractive women. I really wish that my newfound confidence didn't have to come with these new realizations about the world around me."
2321,2014-10-13 16:30:32,I confess that seeing all of the solidarity my peers are showing with the St.Louis community around the deaths of Mike Brown and Vonderrit give me hope and inspire me to think outside of myself
2322,2014-10-13 16:46:34,"I confess that I want this school to be more widely known. SLU is the #1 trending topic on Facebook right now because of the protest/sit-in yesterday. This is our chance to get some recognition! Imagine if we had that spot, how many more people wouldn't think it's in Seattle or DC. Seriously, let's start some shit and boost our profile."
2323,2014-10-13 13:13:35,"Sometimes I feel like I've committed myself to a business rather than to a school. 

Granted, I'm thankful for the financial aid that Wash U gave me, and I have had some amazing professors. But I can't help but feel like I'm just another student for the school to make money off of. I realize that this problem is true for all major colleges in the US, but the bottom line is that education shouldn't be a business. Not at Wash U, not anywhere. 

Unlike many of my peers and fellow students, I don't come from a rich family. I don't own a car and I've relied on public transportation for most of my life. Being forced to pay so much money for food and housing is a foreign concept to me, and it kills me to see so many people being able to easily afford the things I work so hard to have. 

I feel like I don't have the money to be able to enjoy Wash U properly. It makes me wonder if going to a private university was the right choice for me."
2324,2014-10-13 03:36:37,I confess that I'm so lonely so much of the time. I broke up with my ex 2 years ago and to this day I can't trust any guy enough to let him in and I'm scared that I'm pushing all the good ones away
2325,2014-10-13 02:00:38,"I confess that I know I'm attractive, but the kind of guys I like are always too afraid to approach me or make a move. It's gotten so bad that I fantasize about being raped, and then I think I'm a terrible person."
2326,2014-10-12 22:04:40,"I confess that if the Cardinals lose this game, I'm going to poop on my roommate's bed because he's a Giants fan and obnoxious about it."
2327,2014-10-12 21:01:41,"I confess that the lack of socioeconomic diversity on this campus is depressing. My parents could barely even afford to pay 1/3rd of my tuition even if ALL of their income went directly to my education.

I dread holidays. I dread going home and dealing with the drug use and occasional domestic abuse. I dread hearing my mother apologize to me every holiday that she can't give me more. I despise the sense of guilt that I have when I actually accept a gift that I know she could barely afford to buy- or used credit or a loan to purchase.

With the pissing contest of everyone complaining and having the world's largest problems, I don't think I can ever explain things like this to people on this campus."
2328,2014-10-12 21:53:42,I confess that lesbian porn makes my world go round.
2329,2014-10-12 20:02:43,"To the asshole who dumped everyone's laundry on the floor of Lopata House:

We get it. Your laundry is important. Very important. There was absolutely no way your dirty clothes could have waited another five minutes for a machine. That's totally cool.

What's also totally cool is the fact that you thought it would be okay to just go ahead and dump out the contents of not one, but EVERY MACHINE onto the floor. Both washers and dryers. Totally cool.

Maybe the best part, though, was the fact that you saw fit to, I don't know, mix all of that laundry together, in several nice big wet piles across the room (remember, wet laundry + dry laundry = more wet laundry). If there's one thing I look forward to, it's picking through other people's wet laundry to try and fine bits and pieces of my own. And I'm sure they appreciate it too.

So if anyone happens to find one of my shirts, a pair of boxers, and maybe a few stray socks within their own clothes, please, PLEASE don't thank me. Thank the asshole who decided it was a good idea to send a tornado spiralling through the basement."
2330,2014-10-12 00:25:45,"I looked at the door to my room this morning, and I found a message written from a person who lived in my room last year. It said, ""I used to live here"" and ""You don't know the things I've done here"". I was so creeped out that I told my RCD and they're looking at the security footage.

I'm sorry to the person who did this, my actions were probably a little rash. I hope the consequences aren't too severe."
2331,2014-10-11 23:47:48,"I confess that I recently had my first counseling appointment through shs. The issue for which I decided to go is not pertinent to this confession, but I wanted everyone who has posted on here about needing some kind of help to know that it was a genuinely good experience. My day started off pretty terrible but after the appointment I felt a lot better. I really encourage everyone to take advantage of that resource if you feel like you need it. It's really hard to ask for help, but getting help is so worth it. Taking care of yourself is worth it. You are worth it."
2332,2014-10-11 23:18:49,I'm at a point in my relationship where I think we are going to get married down the line if we don't break up within the year. If something doesn't change soon it's just going to happen. Is it horrible that I think I would be okay with or without her? I hate that I feel this way and I hate that I don't need her.
2333,2014-10-11 23:20:52,"I love this page and feel that the admin is awesome for putting the struggles of so many people out in the open. That being said, I can only hope that compassion fatigue doesn't set in on the WashU community because of the plethora of posts on this page. The tendency to stop caring is natural, but I urge people to recognize and resist it."
2334,2014-10-11 21:55:53,I'm terrified that my ex has screwed me up so badly that I am never going to recover and be able to be in a normal happy relationship.
2335,2014-10-11 21:50:55,I started playing Runescape again. The old version of the game just makes me feel so nostalgic and happy.
2336,2014-10-11 21:09:56,"I'm a black student and I don't participate in organizations like ABS because I feel like any group centered on race indirectly encourages self-segregation among students. I acknowledge that many people think students of the same race may share common interests and experiences because of culture, but I feel like this inhibits people forming relationships outside their own race. I mean if you look around campus at any given time, it seems like minorities are traveling in cliques. I'm not saying it's bad to have friends your own race, but if your friendship circle is 75% your own race, I think you need to branch out more."
2337,2014-10-11 21:33:57,"Whenever I get emails from wash u telling me to be an ""ambassador,"" I'm tempted to do it and tell as many people as possible NOT to go to wash u. Partly because it would be fun and partly because I truly dislike (I wouldn't say hate) this school and deeply regret coming here, it was one of the biggest mistakes I've made in my life. Sadly it's too late to transfer."
2338,2014-10-11 21:56:58,"I am absolutely terrified that I have met, dated, and been dumped by my soulmate. It has been six months and I still cannot assuage the heartbreak I feel over the thought that he decided, after getting to know me better than anyone else and at times better even than I know myself, that I am not who he wants to be with."
2339,2014-10-11 12:19:11,"Sometimes when I get in an elevator, I pretend it's a TARDIS. That way, instead of getting off at a different floor, I can get off at a different world, or time, or dimension. Sometimes I add the sound effect."
2340,2014-10-11 12:05:12,"I think a big reason why people aren't getting laid more is because of the awkwardness (and kind of assholishness) of sexiling. I wish WUSTL built some rooms where you could go for the night and have sex, maybe pay a little fee with Bear Bucks."
2341,2014-10-11 12:55:14,"I confess that I'm really sorry for bumping into Julianna [XXXXX] on Friday and spilling her food all over the ground. I can't find her Facebook and I don't have her #. So I just wanted to say I'm so sorry, I was in a rush and I should stopped and helped you pick all that fruit up :-/"
2342,2014-10-11 12:36:15,"I confess that I'm annoyed. Everything's a learning experience, so can't you fucking tell me that I'm bad at sex? I don't know what the hell I'm doing, so can't you do just a little more teaching than just leaving disappointed? I feel like a failure every time you do (as in like twice ever)."
2343,2014-10-11 12:24:20,"I really, really miss my old dog.
He was the one thing I thought about everyday coming home from high school. Most people don't even get how close I was to him, and that's fine, because he brought me too much joy and love to even care.
He's at a different home now, but I still think about him almost everyday and wish he was here with me to play and hug and just have. I'd take him over any friend here because he was my family.
Miss you, bro."
2344,2014-10-10 19:59:21,"Ok, I know I'm not supposed to ask questions here but I'm getting desperate. How exactly do I find people to date and/or hook up with? I promised myself I would lose my virginity by the end of the year by any (legal and non destructive) means necessary, but it's not happening. People tell me I'm fairly attractive so I don't think it's that, and I can fake being confident when I need to. I just need to find a way to get in the door. I've tried clubs but I don't really like any of the clubs here. Would you recommend Tinder? Most people I've talked to said it sucks. I'm 100% serious."
2345,2014-10-10 18:43:22,"I confess that now that I've graduated WashU, I appreciate my experience more than I thought I would. I definitely had my ups and downs at WashU (thanks for the low GPA), but overall, I have to say it was definitely worth it. I learned a lot about myself, met great professors, and made some amazing friends. Thanks WashU!"
2346,2014-10-10 18:54:24,I just really want a cooking buddy.
2347,2014-10-10 17:25:25,"I confess that as much as I love washu and the friends and experiences I have had here, I feel like I can't compete academically. I just got back a couple of exams from my classes and I didn't even meet the average for any of them. This is my last year to prove to my parents that I belong here by pulling my GPA up (it's pretty shitty right now), otherwise they're going to pull me out. I thought I could do it but now I keep doubting myself and I'm not sure what to do anymore. I feel like if I try my hardest and my best, I could manage to do it, but my motivation is so low that trying in and of itself is hard. It doesn't help that I've been having to deal with depressive thoughts and issues for the past couple years and haven't really had treatment yet. I feel so lost."
2348,2014-10-10 16:57:26,"I confess that I get emotional when I see worms struggling on the sidewalk when it's raining. It's our fault that they are there, and it shows how poor our land and water conservation practices are."
2349,2014-10-10 15:51:28,"have asked if I'd consider starting the new Wash U Admirers page. I've been getting a number of confessions requests that are Admirers-style anyway. 

The short answer is: I'd love to, but not yet. 

The bottom line is that I don't know what's going on with the Admirers page administrator, and he/she could be going through personal issues in his life. That admin may or may not come back, but in the meantime, I shouldn't be trying to take their audience. So I don't feel like it's within my boundaries to try to revive the Admirers community - at least not right now. 

For now, I'm the Confessions administrator. Admirers is a different community, and I know what my boundaries are. Maybe after waiting a bit, if people would really like Admirers to come back, I could start that new page. But for now, I'm going to wait it out. 

So I can revive Wash U Admirers, but first, I'd really like to see if the old page is really defunct and how popular the demand for a new page is. Running pages takes time and web hosting costs money, but I'd be willing to do it after some time has passed if the community really wants it."

2354,2014-10-10 02:15:37,"I came into college with the idea of living in the moment, no regrets, and a lot of times that meant that my portion of men would come from hookups. For the time it served its purpose, but although I never thought I would say this, I'm a junior and I'm ready for a boyfriend. Not only am I ready, I really want one. I am a very pro-believing there are tons of awesome guys out there person, and all guys are certainly not the same. There are great guys out there that want the same I do too. I won't go on Tinder or any of those things, but I wish we would somehow meet and make our lives better in that way."

2356,2014-10-10 00:10:40,"In the midst of musical diversity, I feel musically isolated at Wash U. So we have Disney acapella and jazz in Holmes and even k-pop dance groups, but we don't have one measly club dedicated to hard rock or metal? I know most people probably don't think this is a big deal, but it's frustrating not having people to discuss common musical interests with. Sure, Ariane Grande is great and all, but where's the Amon Amarth? Where's the A7x? Or at least some Metallica! Are there really no fellow head bangers out there?"

2362,2014-10-09 19:32:49,"I'm really anxious about the teachers in my major talking about me  to each other. I'm anxious about people talking about me in general, but I care about what my teachers think of me more than random other kids in my class. I haven't done exceptionally well in any of my courses, and I never say anything smart or interesting. It's a small enough major I know the professors all know me. But I don't think they like me, or at least I've never given them a reason to.

I admire and respect those professors, and I'd like to be able to be able to keep in contact them after I graduate for help and resources and recommendations. They're also good people who I'd love to get to know better.  But I always get the feeling that they think I'm an airhead who is wasting their time. And I wonder if they'd be wrong. I want to believe I'm smart, but just ill spoken. But maybe that's just because if you talk enough about random stuff eventually you're bound to say something clever by accident.

I whined about a computer program one of my teachers uses, and I remember the look of exasperation in his face and my stomach is in knots. I want to apologize but they've probably already forgotten it's happened.

I'm being paranoid, but I'm so scared that they are all informing each others opinions about me and think I'm not worth their time."
2363,2014-10-09 12:17:52,"I came to WashU over an Ivy because I received a very generous scholarship, but more importantly, the people I met seemed to be more genuine and caring, the campus was beautiful, and I figured that the academics, while rigorous, would not be as stressful. But now I'm a junior, and I'd be lying if I said that I didn't regret my choice. I've never been more dismal academically in my life since I came here. Each semester, I tried to start on a clean slate and tried to study really hard for exams and start papers earlier so I wasn't scrambling last minute. But even when I did that, I never got good results, which leads me to not start earlier for other assignments and exams as well. I got out of a midterm just yesterday that I know I failed, and it's been eating away at me and bringing back the stress that I always felt here. This is a class I need for my major so I can't drop it. That isn't all - I feel like I have only a fraction of the friends here than I did in high school. And most of my closer friends aren't people that I met here. Meeting people here seems to be a lot more fleeting, and other than my fraternity brothers who I love, I can't seem to get people to stick around in my life. I'm not trying to disparage anyone here - I honestly just wanted to get this all off my chest. I envy all those people who are so well-known and liked around campus, those people who can say hi to such a diverse group of people on a single walk down campus, those people who, on top of killing it socially, are getting on the Dean's list and amazing internships. I know WashU isn't inherently a bad school, but it seems like I personally can't fit in here. And that's why I keep wondering if I made the wrong choice when I was a measly 18 year old. But now I'm stuck here, too late to transfer, with a tarnished GPA, and have to ride it out. Certainly doesn't help that my dream career requires graduate school."

I can't take it anymore. It feels like I have nothing to live for, except for my family (that is far away) and my grades (which, recently, haven't been so hot). Whenever I get a terrible grade, I feel like just another aspect of my life is going down the drain. Counselors haven't helped and I don't know what else to do.

2370,2014-10-08 23:49:12,"I confess that as an Asian, I have got 13 not-A-range grades over my past three years at Wash U, including a C, in a class that is very much related to my major, and a D+ and a F, both in my major. I ended up retaking all three classes, and I still got a B- after retaking that D+ class, although the other two turned out fine.

All of these shit happened in my first 3 semesters here and since then I had worked super hard and finally got my GPA back to a reasonable range and am eligible for honor societies, Dean's List and honor thesis. I tried my best to make it up by TAing for  two of the three classes I've screwed up.

However, as I am applying to grad schools, I am really freaking out. PhD programs are more competitive than I have ever imagined. Top schools receive almost 200 applications per year and they admit like 3 students. I have been pre-grad for the past 10 years (no kidding) and have been doing researches since Freshman year. I really want to be in a top program and I am willing to work hard, take a gap year, whatever to get there. Yet I am afraid that my first three semesters have done irreversible damage to my future. Although everyone assures me that no one really cares about the first semesters but what if every applicant has a crazy high GPA and they just throw my application out without looking at anything else?"

As a junior, I've been to 3 different Christian fellowships on campus, and I didn't particularly feel welcomed by their communities... They were very nice, but it always felt superficial. They were either extremely exclusive (unintentionally) or not tight at all...  At this point, I kind of just gave up on finding a community of brothers and sisters with the same faith.. But since everyone is so friendly & helpful on WashU confessions, I thought I might as well try and ask: is there any Christian groups on campus that actual has a great community that will genuinely welcome new members?"

They kept asking me for proof of my A's and even threatened to call the school! So I finally gave in and told a half-truth - that I had gotten one C (more like three). First of all, I am already disappointed in myself enough, I don't need their disappointment too. And secondly, it (they) were my first C ('s) ever! Wash U is hard, and they don't understand that. They just see me as imperfect, no matter how hard I try."

I have been fighting for too long. For so much of my life. And I am growing weaker, more tired. I know I was a burden on my closest friends last semester. They don't need to go through this again."

2377,2014-10-08 14:21:25,"I have a question to the admin: Would it somehow be possible to submit pictures that don't contain anything identifiable along with a confession? How would I go about doing that?

====

You can upload the picture online to an image hosting site and send me the link. If you're concerned about removing all data in the picture file, you can use an exif metadata remover online (http://www.verexif.com/en/) before uploading it, but when I post it online, Facebook will automatically strip the image's metadata anyway. 

I've been thinking about adding image uploading functionality to WashUConfessions.com, but that'll take some time to do and I've been swamped in work the past few days. I'll work on it when I've got time if people would really like that though!"

If I didn't, I wouldn't be going to school here, or maybe I would be if I got a bunch of financial aid or something. The thing is, is my dad always pushes me to try and find more money at this school, and I constantly encounter roadblocks because of need-based everything. I would feel bad, if I end up getting funding instead of someone else who ""needed"" it more, but when I'm doing work for this school for free because my area won't hire non-work study students, I'm not exactly thrilled. I'm just sad that I literally can't get paid for doing work that takes a lot of time and effort. But its relevant to my future so I do it anyways. I am privileged  for sure, but sometimes I feel a tad exploited because my work is always free. Except psych experiments, my other job..."

2381,2014-10-07 17:48:32,"I feel like as a member of greek life  it's even easier to be generalized and stereotyped based on the fact that you're in it at all than in regards to your particular chapter or frat. It's the rudest thing when people who aren't even involved in Greek Life say things like ""that's not even a cool sorority"" or ""that frat's lame"" as if they can't believe anyone would take pride in being in it due to it not reaching ""top"" standards. As someone who is involved in Greek Life, I feel like 75% (at least) of members recognize that there's more to it than just ""being the best,"" it's about finding a community of people whom you can identify with and having a blast with them. For someone who is a complete outsider to Greek life and especially the rush process to make such a vapid generalization demeans the whole thing."
2382,2014-10-07 17:40:34,"Last year I was seeing a guy who may have been the most perfect person I've ever encountered. He made me happy, secure. He crutched to BD in the rain just to sit with me. I was afraid to tell him so many things - that my father was ill, but I couldn't go home. That I'm ill, and I won't ever get better. I clung to him, and predictably drove him away. Our mutual friends blame him, and I hate it. He was the kindest person in the world. I'm the one who drove him away. Even now, though I go out with other guys, he's the one I miss. Every time I see him, I lose my breath a little. We don't talk anymore, and I can't find any way to express how I feel. But if he wanted a second try, if he ever came back, I'd drop everything."

Sometimes I wish there was a societally acceptable way to ask a friend if they wanted to share a bed with you and snuggle. And yet, I'm finding that while I used to be relaxed and carefree about this, I notice myself now wondering if the other person is assuming things that aren't true, or if I'm leading them on unintentionally, or wondering what people would think. I hate that I do this now, because even though there are nights I ache for companionship, I feel like I'm not sully enjoying it on the occasions I get to have it."

I think the main problem is that I am not confident enough to show my feelings to another person and that I am always keeping my feelings to myself.

2387,2014-10-06 21:33:41,"I know there are plenty of great Greek organizations on campus and I really love my own, but my best friend joined a sorority that has turned her into the worst version of herself and it's made me seriously question Greek life as a whole. Because of the influence of those girls she's become catty, shallow, and stuck-up. She spends all her time dirty rushing pretty freshmen (she'll even trash my sorority in front of me) because she's been told that's how her chapter will win recruitment. And when she came home a few weeks ago on the verge of alcohol poisoning from their ""sophomore hazing night"" not a single one of her so-called sisters bothered to help take care of her or even check to see if she was okay. Honestly I'm so torn because I want her to be happy, but I don't know how to tell her that her sorority is making her into someone I can't consider a friend."

2389,2014-10-06 21:14:43,"as a relatively recent wash u alum, i regret not taking my studies more seriously.  i coasted through college taking the easier classes/electives where possible and getting a decent gpa, instead of challenging myself and really pushing the limits of my brain.  i wouldn't trade the fun i had, but i wish i had taken my studies more seriously.  i'm doing a lot of independent studying on topics i'm interested in now, but i don't have as much time with a full-time job and various programs that i'm involved in.  i'm writing this in hopes that it will make anyone currently at wash u, or any university appreciate the 4 years you guys have to expand the potential of your brain.  Never again will you have complete freedom and resources to learn anything you want.

learn a new language.  take classes in different schools.  take business school classes if you're in the art school.  take a graphic design or computer science class.  most importantly, learn how to learn.  that's the skill that you get to spend 4 years developing with no distractions.  if you can properly learn to learn, you're better positioned for success than someone with an inflated gpa taking easy electives.  gpa only matters in college.  in the real word, you're measured by the value that you create.  that value increases exponentially if you know how to learn and continue doing so after college."

Now that I'm a senior applying to grad school, I feel like they're holding it over my head in the sense that they're constantly talking about how ""I really can't apply to X school because they spent *so* much money on my education already."" I've loved my time at WashU and I can't imagine having gone anywhere else, but if I had known it would've been such a problem, I might've chosen differently."
2394,2014-10-06 15:23:53,"I feel like a lot of people at Wash U fail to understand something very basic about human beings.

Guys, somewhere out there there will ALWAYS be somebody who doesnt like you. It might be your hair. Might be your religion. Might be your sexual orientation. Might be some even more ridiculous bullshit reason. In the real world, there isnt a bias report system. Sometimes you just gotta walk it off."

My family always tries to make me eat way past being full because they want me to change my weight, despite my already eating more than them.
It's great that we have a movement towards body acceptance, but why does that always have to come with skinny-shaming?  So many songs dismiss ""skinny bitches"" as fake and snide - how is that body positive?
Why is it okay for people to make fun of my weight?  Insult me for it?  Try and change me?"

2400,2014-10-06 15:55:12,"Honestly I'm kind of fed up with all of this stuff about consent, alcohol, and rape. I definitely think sexual assault is still a huge problem on campuses across the country, but when I hear people here say that ""you can't give consent under the influence of alcohol, and therefore that's rape"" it makes me question the credibility of everything else you say. A sober or buzzed guy taking advantage of a clearly hammered girl is obviously a predatory, aggressive act. But if two people are drunk at a party and go back and have sex, and one of them regrets it the next morning, that's not rape. Do people not realize that if we say alcohol=no consent=rape, then 90% of sexual activity in college would be considered rape?"
2401,2014-10-06 12:30:14,"I confess that my experiences at Wash U are reminiscent of an experience at McDonalds. They show you the ""menu"" with happy students, a beautiful campus, and ""tons"" of activities for student to get involved in. Happy students- scarce at best. Granted the campus is beautiful, but when you're advised not to venture too far beyond, you're bound to get tired of it. As for student activities, if you are a pre-med or engineering there are tons of options for you. If not, you're like a vegetarian who for some inconceivable reason goes to McDonalds to enjoy a meal.

I was thoroughly disappointed with my freshman experience, and though I came into this year optimistically, my enthusiasm is long gone. I feel that I've been tricked into purchasing a meal that cannot possibly live up to the high expectations set for it. I know the University couldn't care less about my opinions, and that nothing will change, but if someone on staff is reading these, please please consider paying more attention to a humanities department, or a foreign language department. We're students here too... And as I always say, everyone deserves to enjoy their McDonalds."
2402,2014-10-06 12:16:15,"Some people complain about Wash U Confessions being too depressing or candid or what have you, but I confess that I love how open this page has become.
I think it speaks more for the school that we have such an open forum for all sorts of discussion rather than having a watered down page full of bullshit confessions like ""tall girl in library ur hawt date me plz ;)))"""
2403,2014-10-06 12:05:20,"I confess that I regret telling anyone when it happened that I might have been sexually assaulted.

I was so confused at the time, there were so many layers to the incident, and I personally didn't remember anything that happened. When I woke up in the morning, I looked around and felt my stomach drop and horror wash over me as I saw my clothes in the corner and someone I considered one of my best friends asleep beside me.

I know drunken hookups aren't exactly uncommon, but when I recounted the night separately to a few close friends, each one independently came to the conclusion that what had happened was rape - he wasn't as drunk as I was, and I was blackout.

But I didn't want to think of myself as a rape victim, and I couldn't put the burden of that label onto my friend - it felt so wrong. How could I consciously continue to be friends with someone I thought had raped me? How could that one night erase years of friendship?

It hurt more to temporarily give up that friendship than it did when some of the few people who knew chose sides or blamed me for what happened. Because the thing is, people don't want to change their lives for your problems. They tell you that under no circumstances can you have another alcohol-related fuck up, yet they get upset when you won't come out and drink with them. They tell you that you can't be friends with someone who would hurt you like this, yet they want you all to hang out and carry on as if nothing happened. They wanted me to change my life without having to feel the ripples suffuse through theirs, and that was the most frustrating.

I don't think he raped me - the intent wasn't there. The horror I felt may have paralleled that of an actual rape victim, but I can't honestly say that the situation wasn't my fault. I don't drink anymore, and we are friends, but I wish I had never told anyone else what had happened. If no one knew, then no one could judge me for being a hypocrite, for causing so much drama at the time and for trying to act like none of this ever happened now that I'm finally emotionally okay."
2404,2014-10-06 12:49:21,"I overheard someone the other day talking about going to the birthday party of someone who posted here a while back. I know a lot of people respond to messages saying ""feel free to talk to me"" and stuff, but I feel it's like a whole other level of awesome to take the time out of your (no doubt very busy) weekend to make someone's birthday feel special. Whoever it was who followed through on that, good on you. You're the kind of people every good person deserves in their lives."

2406,2014-10-05 21:12:24,"I feel like my placement on any sexual orientation spectrum is a mess highly conflated by personal experiences and misguided childhood perspectives. It isn't necessary or appropriate to explain myself to other people. Alternatively could everyone just stop talking about me, or any other human being as a run of the mill heteronormative person? Unless of course they go ahead and tell you their run of the mill heteronormative, then its fine. The model of assuming people's non-visible orientation as default hetero until proven something else is downright annoying, and often connotes that any identification outside of that requires some sort of evidence to prove its validity. I understand that if people experience male-female attraction it may seem natural to pose questions or statements that make the assumption others do too. Just consider that people who don't feel like you do could be getting alienated."

2408,2014-10-05 21:40:26,"WashU is so bullshit sometimes. The science departments, based on some bullshit rankings, are among the best in the nation. I am taking bio and physics this year, and I expected one or both of these courses to have been run a fraction of how well the chem department is run.
        But no, every bio lecturer here is among the worst teachers I’ve ever had; some are condescending, some talk completely incoherently, and they all just straight up don’t teach the material well, then they expect you to make huge leaps in logic on the exams (which are always way harder than the practice material) to figure out things they never explicitly taught.
        Then theres physics, where even though I know several of the lecturers are very good, they run the course in a way that you literally have to teach yourself most of the material… The lectures are convoluted and do not get the major points across. And then they give you exams way harder than the practice material they’ve given you. I actually know less physics now than I did a month ago.
        I am pissed off. Why am I asking my parents to pay 60k a year for me to teach the material to myself? WashU ropes in students with its artificially inflated rankings, beautiful campus, and programs which are basically implemented so WashU can brag about itself — I mean for God’s sake I sprained my ankle last Friday and didn’t get it checked on campus out because SHS fucking closed at noon!
        All the time I wish I had gone to my state school, and I’m ashamed of myself for not having the courage to leave. Before I came here I assumed WashU was rigorous because the material was hard, but now I know that WashU is rigorous not only because the material is hard, but because they don’t fucking teach it."

I have done it many times through both Chem and Calc and at both I felt completely inadequate and stupid. I thought it was a meeting for kids who did not understand the material to work together to finish it, but instead it was always, at least in my case, the chance for one or two kids who knew everything to shine and feel confident and make me feel like crap because I didn't know anything. I always felt the unhappiness of the others when I needed to redo a problem or needed it explained to me. The other group members do not want to waste time and not finish the set or not leave early just because one or two people do not understand it. Instead, I usually just sit there and be quiet and only volunteer for scribe so I would not need to say anything and hold the group up. However, I wanted to try to really understand since Calc is so hard for me so I spoke up more but this didn't help and showed my ignorance. Just the last time I went, one of the other members spoke to me like I was an idiot and obviously thought he was doing a favor by ""teaching me"". I understand trying to help, but the air of being better than me is very disheartening and does not make PLTL enjoyable. So now I am reverting back to not speaking at all and dread PLTL. I feel this actually hinders me because I feel so behind, but I am to scared to speak up to get help. I emailed some tutors but I have had no response and some of  the math TAs are sometimes rude and unhelpful and are not a weekly thing I can utilize to help every week. Any suggestions?"

Things haven’t been perfect so far, but that’s totally okay because I’m in a good place in life right now, and I’m happy with that. So is it so wrong that I just want to stay away from all the unnecessary (and often drunken) drama that constantly seems to be going on? Why does it matter who didn’t call who and what someone thought someone said about someone else? Because I’m so done with that."
2413,2014-10-05 13:46:35,"There has been a lot of talk about racism on here recently, and what I'd like to say is that while the infamous #1341 certainly isn't %100 correct about the black students on campus, I can understand his/her sentiment that lead to the post.  When any activists on campus (regardless of race, gender, or cause) become so deeply invested in issues that seem small (whether they are actually small or not doesn't much matter), it can be perceived almost as these activists ""crying wolf.""  I think that were they to focus their attention on a smaller number of really big issues, these groups would have more clout on campus.  When they react so strongly to things that I or other classmates might not even notice, they come off as overreacting.
That being said, I believe that everyone should have the right to express themselves, in whatever form that takes.  If an event upsets you, say something about it, do something about it.  But at the same time, not everyone else can be expected to express themselves in the same way, nor can they be expected to take issue with all of the same things and hold the same ideals.  Wash U students are all passionate about something, but they will never all be passionate about the same thing.  We will disagree, argue, and protest.  Just remember that while you have a right to protest for your side, so do the people you are protesting against."

Part of my recovery included eating healthy and working out regularly and it has changed my life completely and I don't know if I'd be where I am right now if it wasn't for that. My roommates are really unsupportive and keep pressuring me to eat unhealthy or skip workouts because it makes them feel bad for not working out or eating healthy, and I don't know how to tell them that it's one of the few things keeping me sane."

2417,2014-10-05 06:38:41,"To be completely honest, going to this school has made me feel really smart. I'm doing a rigorous double major, and the higher level ""harder"" classes have just been more doable for me. Classes are fun; they take work, but they always end up being rewarding in the end if you commit yourself.

So to people who are struggling: it's either because you don't have the right mindset, or because you aren't smart enough. Which do you think it is? You only have control over one of those things.

Frankly, stupid people end up successful all the time (we've all seen it). Don't focus on your capabilities, focus on your mindset. The world is a tough competitive place, and you can't afford the luxury of worry. Work hard, work smart, and do the best you can: then you have nothing to apologize for."

Anytime someone asks me about my personal life and my relationship is brought up, I almost always get responses ranging from slightly skeptical to flat out rude. I am tired of hearing people try to bet on ""how long that will last."" Yes, being in a long distance relationship is hard. It is not for everyone. But it is a personal choice between two people that does not merit condescending and negative comments and responses from people who don't even know our story.

I want to live like the Busch and many other old money families did and build my own private rural utopia.

Every time someone tells me I just have a ""big body"" or ""large shape"", I feel like shit because there's almost nothing more I can do. There reaches a point where losing weight for me will actually be unhealthy. Guys try and pick me up, and they groan, even though I told them not to try.

My Dread Lord has commanded me to imbue upon this world a sense of chaotic antimatter to cause energetic pyrochromancy, and I am close to task completion.

2426,2014-10-04 20:43:56,"As an LGBTQ student, I feel so disrespected and excluded on this campus. Going to Pride Alliance actually makes me feel worse about myself. All I wanted was a community of people who feel the same way I do, but what I found was a cliquey competition for who's got it worse and who's the quirkiest. I just want friends who understand what I go through and feel. Even outside of Pride, the rest of campus feels so heterocentric, and I get intimidated by the lack of LGBTQ visibility in classes and around campus. Can someone help without being counterproductive?"

Comments/statuses negative toward the administration deleted, one time even logged in to find ""I"" had made a bunch of pro-admin comments on the Save Boo Boo page last school year (I guess I left my page up at home).  Mom has literally called me for my facebook password before so she could go in and do it herself when I wasn't near a computer, threatening with sanctions at home if I didn't comply (I did).  Some of the times she decided to herself, other times her co workers and higher-ups have asked her to because they knew she could make me."
2430,2014-10-04 16:03:12,"While we are on the subject of discrimination, I feel that there is too much swole-shaming going on around campus. Negative perceptions about my personality are often inferred. People are surprised when they discover I am not vain or judgmental.

Members of the opposite sex seem to look at me as an object and not understand me for the multidimensional person I am, and it is heartbreaking. Potential partners have turned me down because they think they would become self conscious about their bodies. People I eat with often comment on the amount of food that I eat. They either make it seem as if I am privileged to eat that amount ""guilt-free"", or that I am wasting resources by taking care of myself. I get scoffed at when I set bedtimes on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday nights. Family and strangers often insist about how ""being too muscular"" is ""unhealthy"", and try to intervene in my lifestyle choices.

When I propose a portion of my lifestyle to people asking help, they oftentimes reply that my solution would overshoot their goals- discrediting the hard work and discipline for my lifestyle.

I believe that we should act upon the realization that stereotyping and discrimination comes in more flavors than gender, sexuality, or race. Unfortunately, I am afraid to talk to many people about the ways I feel marginalized as a result of my lifestyle choices."

My post was up and when I saw it there were 74 likes and around 7 comments (on Friday). Later that night I looked for it again and it had disappeared. I suppose I should have made a copy of what I'd written because I no longer have it.

Can you ressurrect my post? I hope you can understand why I'm not sending you a PM. If that post was identified as having been written by me, I would face sanctions from the university and very likely lose my job altogether.""

Anonymous poster,

Your post (#1299) is still up here: https://www.facebook.com/WashUConfessions/posts/952301184796697

Facebook shows the most recent statuses first, so it was just bumped down the page a bit after more confessions went through.  

I really do appreciate that you spoke up about these problems. I completely understand why you didn't send me a private message.  As a side note, I really appreciate the general level of trust that's been given to me and rest assured, these confessions are completely anonymous and will not be censored or edited. 

I have not yet received any complaints from the University, but even if I did, I would not let them censor the thoughts of the community or break anonymity."

2438,2014-10-04 15:23:26,"If I hear one more person spouting off the fact that ""women only make 77 cents for every dollar a man makes"" as an argument for why society is so sexist, I might have to stab myself. If you actually look into the statistic it doesn't mean that a man makes more than a woman if they're in the same job. It means that on average across the US men tend to take more dangerous, higher paying jobs, and work more hours. The statistic is comparing average income across the nation, not individual cases. If it were true that women were only paid 77 cents on the dollar for the same work, every company would fire all the men, and hire women because it would be cheaper."
2439,2014-10-04 15:02:28,"I confess that I am questioning something that has been a very important part of my life here at WashU. I've been a member of the Compliments club for 4 semesters now, and I've been out there every Friday that I could be. I love seeing people smile when they get complimented, or laugh at us when we say something stupid, and I truly believe that we brighten up peoples days. In the two-ish years that I've been doing this we've never received anything but positive feedback. People have come up to us and told us how much they appreciated it, tour guides make a point of telling their tours about us, and so on.

This Friday however, a girl came up to us and told us that what we were doing was verbal harassment, and that we were actually scaring a lot of people. I was surprised, and a little upset, because no one had ever expressed that view before, but when I thought more about it it made sense that no one ever had. Someone who was intimidated or scared of our group was probably pretty unlikely to engage us, or tell us how we made them feel. I, and I'm sure I speak for everyone else on Compliments, would feel awful if this was an opinion held by a majority of students, or even just a few. We do what we do with the express purpose of cheering people up and making them smile, and the idea that we are doing the exact opposite of that is really troubling.

So however you feel about Compliments, please let us know. Comment on this post, come and talk to us (we're usually by the underpass midday Friday) or find one of us as we're leaving if you don't want to talk to the whole group. we won't get offended or hurt by whatever you have to say, we just genuinely want to understand what everyone's opinion on us is. Like I said earlier, all we are trying to do is cheer people up on a Friday, and if that isn't what we're actually doing please let us know."

Being poor is only a disadvantage if you let it be. A lack of money has been a wonderful motivator. My economic status came with an open mind, a love for people, and a deep drive for success. Not to mention, my fellow poor people have a depth and level of realness that's hard to find as I climb ""the latter""."

Eventually I saw it posted and was thrilled to see the comments and likes. Now my post is gone. Do you edit/censor posts prior to being posted only or do you take them down after they're up if someone gets upset and complains? Does the University have any control over what's allowed to get posted here?

2447,2014-10-04 03:34:41,"I'm all for the feminist movement in other countries, but I think you the movement has achieved the maximum it can here in the US. Personally I think the purpose of the movement in this country is an attempt to change stuff that is so culturally ingrained that it's nearly impossible to change.

I might feel this way because I was raised in a different country (A country where women don't have anything close to what you guys have here), but I just can't see what the purpose of the movement is here.

I feel that racism is much more prevalent and much more of an issue than feminism, in my day to day life I don't see where women are treated differently because they are women- you guys have all the same opportunities."
2448,2014-10-03 23:39:42,"This is kind of difficult for me to say, but I'm starting to think I was emotionally neglected as a child.

My mother grew up in poverty in Asia, under a widowed single mother with 5 children.  They knew families who were literally starving. As a child my mother went through the sudden death of her father, and witnessed in an unrelated event a fatal explosion in which she was showered with human guts.

My parents took me out of school for five years. During this time they encountered serious financial issues. My father was away at work most of the time, but as a man from a traditional family was emotionally absent. My mother worked as well, but always came home extremely upset. She had serious depression and anger issues. She told us we ruined her life, she regretted having children, she wished we were never born, she wanted to abandon us and go back to Asia.

I feel so guilty, I feel like I have to make up for the fact that I was ever born. The only reason I have made it this far is because I have to prove to her that I am worthy of being loved. I love her, I need to make her feel happy.

My 3 other siblings, stuck with only each other for company for most of the day, replicated these behaviors with each other. We have trust issues, we are cold and subtly hostile to everyone, ourselves, definitely each other.

I know of only one person who I could call a friend on campus. I eat lunch with him for an hour once a week.

I know there are lots of people in the world with real problems, but all I know is living hurts so much inside and I feel like I cannot relate to other human beings. I feel like I'm in cage of despair, looking out at everyone else enjoying their lives and each other's lives, loving each other.

I spend most of my day
1. doing homework
2. doing menial office tasks as a student worker
3. regretting the past, fearing the present, dreading the future
4. struggling to sleep at night, to stay awake in the day

Is this real? Am I just making up excuses? Do I have the right to claim that I truly suffer?"
2449,2014-10-03 23:47:43,"Sometimes I feel like there's a subtle bias against higher socioeconomic people, like the post that said black students shouldn't raise their voices about stuff if they're not from poor towns/neighborhoods. My family's pretty well off, my dad grew up lower-middle class but got a degree and worked hard to be successful. I'm aware of and thankful for the major advantages I've had because of that but I feel too often people assume that if you're not on financial aid you were born with a ""silver spoon"" and everything's been easy. Economic advancement shouldn't be stigmatized."

2451,2014-10-03 20:27:48,I think it's really sad that we don't have more multi-racial relationships on campus. It's unfortunate that a lot of people assume that an individual of another race just won't be attracted to them solely based on their color. The sadder part is that it's sometimes true. I hope that people are more willing to step out of their relationship comfort zone in the future.

Or a man opening a door for you? Seriously? Grow up. (Oh man I'm going to get so much hate for this!)"
2457,2014-10-03 20:24:57,"I thought this place is called Wash U CONFESSIONS. We confess here things that we don't want to say elsewhere and the anonymity is a big part of that. I am always fascinated by how people get so upset here when they see something they don't approve. Why do you even care? Why do you even take the time to judge people? You don't like it, fine then just don't follow it. This place is meant for people to lash out, so nothing but the honest thought should be invited. Next time before you judge so quickly and even take screenshots of the post so you can invite more judgement from your facebook friends, think about it. Maybe it's exactly that kind of attitude of yours that push people to confess here. Are you telling me that you don't have dark thoughts that other people might not approve?"
2458,2014-10-03 20:11:58,"Before coming to WashU, I was indifferent to Christians. In my first few days at WashU, I bumped into a number of Christians who kept inviting me to churches and whatnot. I didn't grow up in an especially liberal city, but my hometown's essentially indifferent to religion. Naturally, I declined their invitations to tag along to church services. I'm an atheist and I told them so.
Big mistake.
Some even told me I was going to hell, that I was doing something sinful and prayed for my salvation alongside a bunch of other bullshit that I don't even believe in. Others chastised me for saying, ""Oh my God..."" or ""Jesus Christ!"" in public. Keep in mind this was all within a few days of arriving on campus, when I was still adjusting to living away from home and wondering if I made right decision with my major selection. The added stress did not help. The lone atheist group was dead back then, and maybe I could've spoken to my RA about it-- but hey, he's an active member at the Catholic Students Center.
I've graduated now and have moved elsewhere that's more tolerant of diverse faiths. But hey, the damage's done. Now whenever I see someone who has a cross necklace or meet a person who attends church regularly, I pretty much write them off permanently without getting to know them. At times, I'm tempted to just harass them on their beliefs just to spite them and make them feel as uncomfortable as I had felt during my four years at WashU. I don't. Why? Because my-lack-of-belief in God has obviously told me what your bible study failed to tell you, dear, narrow-minded 'Christian': treat others the way you want to be treated."

2460,2014-10-03 20:22:12,"Hi,

My name is (xxxx), I'm African - American, Female. I stayed in a shelter for some years of my life (The Salvation Army). I too grew up in some neighborhoods that a lot of people would avoid. My family needed government assistance for years of our lives, and it was not because my parents were lazy and didn't work. I am at Wash U because I worked hard so that my children can have more opportunity than I and my parents' had growing up. So #1341, please check yourself and refrain from making generalizations about the entire black community here at Wash U. You have not lived our lives. You do not know where we came from. You do not know what we've been through. Being at Wash U gives us the privilege of being able to speak for those who are not in a position to do so. To repeat what someone before me has posted, ""it appears that blacks have a double edged sword against them: if you're black, poor, and left victim to police brutality, society says you are claiming false racism. And if you are bettering your reality, studying as a student at WashU, you are too privileged and too rich to fight against racism. So what are blacks to do?"""
2461,2014-10-03 20:12:14,"The recent confession against racial activism shows how harmful the phrase ""check your privilege"" can be. While it is true that a large number of black students on campus grew up in very poor environments, the majority are from middle-class or wealthy families... but that doesn't mean they should care any less about issues affecting others with similar heritage to theirs. ""Reverse classism"" is still classism, and telling people they can't talk about issues they care about just because they have some privilege is very harmful to the movements related to those issues. People who are ""privileged"" have the privilege to speak up and actually be heard and taken seriously. If only unprivileged people were allowed to speak, many movements (anti-slavery, for example) would have had problems getting off the ground. Privilege can be a powerful weapon if used correctly, and privileged people actually caring about the downtrodden is one of the best things that could happen to our society."
2462,2014-10-03 20:05:15,"As a black student myself, I am honestly ashamed of and embarrased by some of my presumptuous and pretentious black peers. Really, we are no different but a lot of us try to make ourselves seem like we're special by overreacting to every little criticism and throwing a fit whenever something isn't 100% politically correct. When we overreact to prejudice, we are simply guilty of prejudice ourselves. And people definitely notice, but most stay silent because we play the black card way too often and they're afraid of expressing their criticisms. But they still hate us- I do too.
To the community: I apologize for all the BS that you get from ""black activists"". I apologize for the black people who have a stick up their ass and construe all criticism against black people as ""racism""."
2463,2014-10-03 20:22:20,"I confess that I am taking a class with the most unforgettable professor I have ever met in my life this semester.  I understand that some people did cheat in his class before, which is absolutely intolerable.  However, his stereotypical and skeptical sentiments and ""ridicules"" against a certain group of international students in my class often create unnecessary intensity in class.  Often times I wanted to say something.  But I was too scared to offend the professor in front of the whole class.  Moreover, aside from his soul-crushing amount of workload, he distributes work unevenly.  For the most recent group project, without any explanation, he assigned the majority of the class with only one simple textbook problem, whereas the other two groups had to present on a whole case which involved reading pages and pages of worksheets.  Enough ranting.  I can't wait to get done with his class."
2464,2014-10-03 16:42:21,"I was a Wash U student in the past. I am an alum and I'm now teaching here. During my entire time (nearly thirty years) I've been disturbed by the way the University operates based on a corporate, hierarchical model where instead of ideas, education and values being of greatest importance, it seems issues related to money, increasing income, fundraising and positive PR direct the primary actions, policies and decisions of the University.

I attended an Ivy League university as an undergraduate. The education of students was the primary value ahead of other priorities (at least that was the case back then). Yes of course that university does a lot of fundraising, but it also encouraged and supported a much greater diversity in the expression of ideas conflicting with mainstream thought as well as ideas contradicting the administration's. There was an open atmosphere encouraging debate and intellectual investigation without concern for retribution and payback.

Here it seems carefully controlling the messages coming out of each school, each dean and each faculty member is more important than encouraging the free exchange of ideas. The university should much more actively support and encourage authentic, honest community interaction and support those in need. Outsiders should feel welcomde to visit campus and students should be encouraged to get to know the residents of the surrounding community.

By buying up so much property and pushing out independent building owners, the university has monopolized housing accommodations. Their policy of providing furnished apartments is a good thing for students however it has hurt many community businesses (viz., Good Works on Delmar). The university should take an active role in supporting local businesses rather than pushing them out in favor of maximizing savings through purchasing good through contracts with large scale vendors.

Wash U has taken on the role of Big Brother in circumscribing where students feel safe and where they ought not venture. Advice given to students like ""Don't go north of Delmar or east of Skinker"" is counterproductive, bad for the university population and bad for the community at large. This advice (purportedly based upon safety concerns) contributes to an 'Us vs. Them' attitude amongst students vis-a-vis the surrounding community.

Wash U treats its students, faculty and staff like it is an all-powerful money making machine we are beholden to and we should feel fortunate and humbled to have the rare, unique opportunity to serve this institution. The true, honest thoughts of members of the academic community are rarely heard. This is particularly true of faculty and staff who have the constant threat of a loss of privileges and/or loss of employment hanging over their heads.

In general, non-tenured faculty are paid far less and given relatively paultry benefits than they deserve. Many staff are similarly inadequately remunerated. For a university with such extensive financial resources, this situation is a disgrace. The amount of money charged by the university for faculty and staff parking is outrageous. Other universities do not extract such excessive fees from those contributing to the vitality of university community."
2465,2014-10-03 12:15:22,"Seeing all these posts from depressed/lonely upperclassmen makes me feel better, because it lets me know that I'm not alone and that others feel the same way I do. I thought I was the only freshman who didn't have friends and pretty much hated life, but now I have hope that there are others out there and that it probably won't go away!"
2466,2014-10-03 11:02:24,"The incredibly offensive confession #1341 makes me ashamed as a WashU alum and concerned about the WashU community. I graduated from WashU with African Americans that were the first to achieve a college degree. Some even grew up in Ferguson and East St Louis. But let's pretend for a moment that the writer of confession #1341's premise that all black people at WashU are privileged is correct... Why should the college educated, ""privileged"" black people that have ""never experienced racism"" not fight for the downtrodden? Is it not all of our duty to society to fight for what's right, regardless of race? Regardless of class? It appears that blacks have a double edged sword against them: if you're black, poor, and left victim to police brutality, society says you are claiming false racism. And if you are bettering your reality, studying as a student at WashU, you are too privileged and too rich to fight against racism. So what are blacks to do?"

2469,2014-10-03 11:55:28,"To the individual who is annoyed with the black activists on campus, believes that we as blessed African Americans have never experienced real racism, and thinks that none of us are from the ghetto: you are very sadly mistaken. First of all, I am African American and I am from the ghetto. I live in one of the roughest neighborhoods in my city where poverty is huge and injustice is real. Secondly, just because we have gotten to WashU doesn't mean that we are extremely privileged.  I was blessed to receive a scholarship and even more blessed that my parents cared enough and were willing to sacrifice to give me whatever I needed to advance my education. Thirdly, I have experienced real racism. I have been called all types of slurs, randomly stopped by the police who thought it was fun to say you were a stopped for no reason other than being black, I have been followed around stores because I am a black and people thought I would steal, and several other incidents. Before you go acting like you know us, please get to know us individually and stop perpetuating the ignorance that got us involved in racial chaos in the first place."
2470,2014-10-03 11:44:29,"I would like to say that I am proud of the African American activists on campus that cause an ""uproar"". Even though they might be more privileged than others DOES NOT mean that they haven't experienced severe forms of racism. As a Black Muslim, I know what it means when you feel like you don't have a voice. It is an honor to go to a university where everyone is not afraid to speak up for not only themselves but for others who dont have the strength to do so themselves."
2471,2014-10-03 11:37:32,"I confess that the fact it feels like WashU curves so many classes pisses me off. I mean honestly, we go to WashU and we're all smart individuals. Professors shouldn't make ridiculous tests where the average is like 50% just so they can always use some kind of BS curve to separate those who got 45% from those who got 55%. How about just making reasonable exams that don't always have to be curved?"
2472,2014-10-03 03:12:34,"After seeing so many depressed messages, I really want to say something to cheer up who would like to be postive. I am a transfer student from a non-English speaking country. 2 years ago when I arrived here, I did not expect any language barriers, because I thought my English was good. However, I had a very hard time understanding the professor first semester. It's getting better but honestly, I still cannot understand everything in class. Seeing all the other students taking notes, asking questions and getting really good grades, I was so sad, because I was a good student (academically) like them too. I cried every other week after the grades came out. There was a time that I really want to quit and go back home. Thanks to my parents. They told me that I am not perfect. I do not need to be perfect and I do not need to compare myself to others. All I need to do is to accept that I am not perfect but I can always do better. It's better for me to focus on my own improvements: getting a better understanding of the course material, being able to speak up and ask questions in class, gaining knowledge instead of focusing on grades etc.. I think many people know this but they might not be able to notice their own improvements. Now, I still spend a really long time doing homework every day. Sometimes I do bad in the exam though I thought I spend enough time on it. But, I know I am making very slow progress.... very slow. I like going to classes every day because I enjoy learning something new every day. Looking back, I just want to laugh at myself: There are so many ways to enjoy a great day and college life. Why did I choose to remain upset and blame myself on not being perfect? Those bad feelings did not help anything. So, cheer up everybody! Life is good! All the difficuties you met were training you to be a tough human being then you will not be scared in the future, because life will always be harder when you become older lol (your parents might agree with this). But do you really care? I think you are awsome. You can handle it! Sincerely, a Senior who really do not want to graduate. Enjoy Wash U."
2473,2014-10-03 02:40:35,"I'm really happy that I have the opportunity to go here. That being said, there are few places as stifling as WashU."
2474,2014-10-03 02:33:37,"I confess that, even though I've often said that I am, and it pains me to say this but...I'm not actually...I'm not actually in a band. I talk about being in a band a lot, and how great it is. But I've never even listened to music before. I don't know what a band is, really. Please help.......I've been living a lie. :("
2475,2014-10-03 02:14:38,"Throughout my freshman year, I was so happy at WashU. Slowly, I've grown to dislike it more and more and now that I'm a senior, I can't wait to graduate. Despite being involved in Greek life, I don't have any close friends and I've never been in a relationship. What am I doing wrong?"
2476,2014-10-03 02:05:40,"I know this isn't Wash U admirers, but they seem to be down, and I have fallen head over heels for the girl with blonde, curly hair who works at the Olin help desk. You always get off work around 10 on Tuesdays, just as I'm coming in, and I am dying to know your name. If you tell me who you are, I will undoubtedly come say HI this week!"
2477,2014-10-03 02:44:41,"When I told my father I was gay, he didn't yell at me, he didn't tell me that he was disappointed (but I knew).  He told me that he didn't think being gay was a path to happiness.  But here's the thing:  I'm in love with my wonderful boyfriend and I'm happier now than my dad ever was.  Point is, don't be afraid to disappoint people. Be the best damn disappointment you can be."
2478,2014-10-03 02:33:42,"My roommate always interferes my sentences, MANY TIMES. Before i finish my first sentence she just spills something totally about her which is totally irrelevent; even if i try to restart my sentences again after she finishes, she will do that again!! It is really disrespectful. I talked to her about it twice, she said she was sorry but never changes."
2479,2014-10-03 02:23:43,"People need to be more courteous to the BD and DUC staff. They're people too, so stop being so damn rude! You are capable of cleaning up after yourself. Don't make somebody else clean up your shit."
2480,2014-10-03 02:12:45,"Reading through all the submissions about depression at WUSTL, I feel truly saddened. Coming from someone who has achieved society-defined ""success"" at Wash U (GPA > 3.9, 99th percentile MCAT, and exec positions in many clubs), I believe the mental struggle exists at some degree  for most Wash U students. Some people may think that because they  have done well, this issue is only for those who have ""underperformed"" at Wash U.

I am here to say that is NOT TRUE. I, along with many friends who also did well in classes, felt excessive amounts of pressure to keep up our grades, do well on every exam, and get into everything we applied for. I have seen, on more than one occasion, friends who have had nervous breakdowns here. Seeing these things, we have to ask, ""at what cost do we obtain our education and is it worth it?""

People often tell me that I am ""intelligent,"" but I confess that I walk into class almost every day scared that I won't live up to people's expectations of me. With every exam, paper, and project, I wonder if I will still be deemed ""smart."" I do not believe I am any better than any other person in any of my classes. With that said, what even is intelligence? I believe intelligence can exist outside of just academic realms. Why does society and Wash U place such an emphasis on being academically intelligent? I believe that the university needs to do a better job addressing the academic pressure students are under and to have more honest discussions about mental health issues.

Sincerely,
A Stressed Senior"
2481,2014-10-03 02:49:48,"I confess that I am a native bilingual, and one of the two languages is English. But I was not born and raised here. I am very much bothered, even offended, when people refer to me as an ESL. I might be a jerk but I just hate that label being connected with me. Yet I am afraid to confront people on that because I am afraid they would think that I'm some sort of hyper sensitive freak or I am discriminating or something. But being called as an ESL caused me a tremendous amount of discomfort and stress every time. Am I crazy or something? What should I do?"
2482,2014-10-03 02:36:49,I confess that I lie to my mom telling her I'm going out to dinner with my floor on my birthday both because I don't want to call her and because I don't want her to know that I don't even have a friend to celebrate it with me as a Senior.
2483,2014-10-03 02:52:52,"I confess that I jerk off to math problems that I can't solve, to relieve all that stress."
2484,2014-10-03 02:39:53,"I confess that much of the time, I hate all of you. I hate you because you can make friends. I hate you because you do well in class. I hate you because you have a significant other. I hate you because you can speak in public without making it obvious that you're scared shitless to do so. And finally, I hate you for doing all of these things (and more) with little apparent effort, when for me sometimes just working up the courage to speak to someone takes so much effort and causes so much strain it isn't worth it."
2485,2014-10-03 02:08:55,"I confess that I love Wash U! I respect the people who have not had  such good experiences but people should know many students are happy here. I love my friends, I love St. Louis, and the only sad thing is that I have to graduate this spring. Wash U is the best college I could have chosen - I would not have grown so much anywhere else.

Also, to all of you who can only see the darkness right now, that was me in high school! I was so depressed I did not make it out of bed most days. Get some help and just keep on going and your life really can become completely different! Give it time and do not give up, you are so capable of living a happy life, something I never believed when I was depressed but it is true :)"
2486,2014-10-03 02:56:56,I confess that I'm a little annoyed with the Black activists on campus. You cause an uproar when anything small happens in the community that might be misconstrued as racism. I'm annoyed because you are more privileged than most of the country. You are not from the ghetto. You are very sheltered and probably have never experienced severe racism firsthand. I'd be more likely to listen to you if you had actually risen from the bottom to attend WashU but I doubt that is the case for any Black people here.
2487,2014-10-02 05:18:57,"I don't understand all these people who do their registration worksheet the day course listings come out. Like bitchh, I don't finish my registration until the third day of class THAT semester. I ain't got time to figure out now what classes I wanna suffer through in five months"
2488,2014-10-02 04:15:58,"I confess that this week, the week before my 20th birthday, I got a C on one of my tests, know that I screwed up the other one, got the lowest grade of the semester for weekly homework for another class, stayed up every single night just to finish work, and have a professor commenting my performance as ""you have all sorts of problems with presentation, but well you are a ESL of course"" (I literally cannot stand it when people attribute things to ESL and talk in a condescending tone. If I have problem with presentation like clarity and stuff I would be more than happy to have people pointed it out to me but please that's MY problem do not attribute that to ESL. I started learning English before kindergarten and according to many researches that almost can be counted in the native speaker range. It's just that I did not grow up here that's it.). I literally cried for half an hour after that class. And now I have an exam ON MY BIRTHDAY (a Saturday), a lot of work to do, no plans, no friends to celebrate, whatsoever, and now I am very reluctant to even be in that class again but apparently add/drop period has passed. Of course it's the best birthday presents. FML."
2489,2014-10-02 04:10:11,I only manage to stay awake during my lecture class because I entertain myself with elaborate fantasies about the class's super sexy TA.
2490,2014-10-02 04:53:12,"Seeing the class listings for next semester made me panic. How the hell should I know what courses to pick for next year when I'm not sure I like my current classes? I'm so indecisive, I still don't know whether I prefer Coke or Pepsi!"
2491,2014-10-02 04:40:14,"Sometimes I purposely and publicly do self destructive things to see if any of my friends care enough to stop me. So far, no one has."
2492,2014-10-02 04:33:15,"I confess that I hate Wash U. I really hate it. There are many aspects of my daily life that can be attributed to this school that make me feel perpetually miserable, and these are a mere few.

For one, I don't feel like I get along with most people here. Everyone seems to be too cutthroat and self-absorbed to bother wanting to extend friendships deeper than ""what answer did you get for number four on the bio exam?!"" I'm not really sure I have that many good friends.

Secondly, this school always makes me feel inadequate. I know it's an academically rigorous university and we all came to this school to be challenged, but this continues to be a hard pill for me to swallow. I do everything I can for an exam, but no matter how well I understand the course material, exams always seem to fly way over my head and I end up swinging a much lower grade than what I feel my understanding is. It's very frusturating.

I've tried changing my study habits, I've tried talking to my professors, and I keep thinking ""next semester I'll like my classes more and do better in them"" but I'm slowly convincing myself that that's never going to happen because, in my experience so far, it still hasn't.

As a sophomore, I thought this year was going to be different but it's turning out to be as exhausting and unfulfilling as last year. I've seriously considered transferring, but I'm too stubborn to let Wash U ""win"" per say. However, I always feel so miserable when I'm here and I just want to be happy again. Is it worth it to transfer junior year of college? Any tips for making Wash U more worthwhile? Because right now, for the sake of my own sanity, it doesn't seem to be..."
2493,2014-10-02 04:01:20,"People keep telling me I'm beautiful but all I see when I look in the mirror is a big forehead, jiggly thighs and a thick waist. I had a pastry today and all I can think about is how much exercise I have to do before the calories are gone, gone, gone. I look at all my friends eat whatever they want and still be skinny and I'm so envious it hurts. I go to bed hungry more often than not but I always end up binging a few days later. I'm scared that I'm developing an eating disorder, but even more than that I'm scared that I like the clean, empty feeling of being hungry. I like seeing the scale go down and my waist get smaller. I know I should get help but I don't want to stop losing, not when I have so much left"
2494,2014-10-02 04:47:21,"I don't know why, but this year has been incredibly difficult for me so far. I can't put words to it. I've fallen so behind in one of my classes that I'm honestly considering withdrawing from it, but it's a pre-med requirement and I know that if I withdraw, seeing as I want to study abroad, there's a very slim chance of me graduating on time if I do. Even with all of that on the line, I still can't find the motivation to catch up on the work. Every morning when I wake up, I can't find the energy to get out of bed and go to the class. When I come home, I have a hard time sitting down and starting the material that I have put off for so long. I have no idea what I'm going to do for the next exam, and just thinking about it terrifies me. I'm even reluctant to talk to a tutor or a TA just because I'm so behind and I'm honestly ashamed that I've neglected the class for so long. I'm not looking for a pat on the back and someone to tell me that I can do whatever I put my mind to, because I know that I can. Actually putting my mind to it is what's been the hard part for me.

I love my major, I landed an amazing job this semester, I get along well with my parents, and I could have never even imagined meeting a guy as amazing as my boyfriend. Because of all of this, I feel like I have no reason to feel the way I feel. I'm doing well in my other classes. I know that I deserve to be here; I wouldn't have gotten in if I didn't. With that being said, I just feel exhausted and unmotivated all of the time and I can't explain why. I get enough sleep, I exercise, I eat healthy and stay hydrated. I feel like I'm stuck in a rut and I just don't know how to get out of it.

I would love to talk to someone at SHS but the appointments book so far in advance... feeling like this kind of comes and goes in waves for me, so I always feel like I'll make an appointment and then feel better by the time it rolls around. Sometimes I think this is just a phase that I'm going through, but lately I've realized that I might actually need some help."
2495,2014-10-01 23:02:22,"I confess that I find it extremely difficult to not judge people that are in Greek Life. It's hard for me to see the value in after just a few days of rushing commiting to letters you don't even understand yet and calling people you just met brothers or sisters. I find it hypocritical and to be completely honest, if I would have known Greek Life was so prevalent in Wash U I would never have applied here.  I don't mean to offend anyone, to each his own--but I think that people considering to rush should really consider their values deeply before pledging. Don't do it just because you think everyone else is doing it."
2496,2014-10-01 23:47:24,I dropped my sorority and I am happier.
2497,2014-10-01 23:28:25,"At age two, I was diagnosed with PDD-NOS, an autism spectrum disorder. I was also one of the very few children who fully recovered, and now I show hardly any autistic traits or symptoms. I have healthy friendships and I do well academically. But I worry that my children will be genetically pre-disposed to have autism. Honestly, it would really kill me not to be able to have a normal relationship with my kids. I'm also frustrated that psychologists know so little about what causes autism, and why I was one of the lucky ones. I wish I had more answers."
2498,2014-10-01 23:11:26,"I confess that I'm just not about the whole rat race of internships and career fairs and job applications, and I kind of (unfairly) judge my friends for ""selling out"" to corporations for big salaries. I know it's because I feel like a loser myself for not being a part of the future six-figure set, but sorry that shit ain't me. It sucks that because college is so expensive everyone feels like they have to make big bucks immediately to justify it. What happened to pursuing what you're interested in? And I know all you can't possibly have a ""passion for finance/consulting"", gimme a fuckin break"
2499,2014-10-01 23:59:28,"Ok this is going to sound really weird, but sometimes I have this inexplicable urge to leave Wash U and join the French Foreign Legion. Having said that I'm worried I would regret it if I did. French Guyana isn't a great place."
2500,2014-10-01 23:47:29,"I kept getting concerned about how I've heard this school handles medical leaves of absence, so I tried to check out the actual policy on SHS's website. Guess what the link led to? 404 error- Page not found.

Actually though. Check it out. (it's actually under a different link on the same page, probably due to some shoddy editing)"
2501,2014-10-01 21:12:32,"I confess that I originally wasn't accepted at wash u, and took summer classes here instead.

The professor was nice,  the people we wonderful, and I even aced the class I took. In the end however I'm happy where I am now, and think that everything worked out in the end. Stay cool you guys"
2502,2014-10-01 21:01:34,"I've seen responses to all of the depression posts to the effect of ""Why are all of you so sad? Life's actually pretty all right."" I've heard close friends of mine make similar remarks with regard to the confessions page in general. So to all of you out there who don't understand what depression is actually like, and who want to understand how it feels and why it's so difficult to escape, I think this comic is one of the best descriptions. I'm hoping this will promote a little more understanding.
And if you're going through it now and haven't seen this, read it too, if only to know you really aren't alone, and that it's possible to make it out alive. It helps a little.

2503,2014-10-01 21:44:35,"I don't know if this counts as a confession, but as a professor here I want to let you students know that we love you and think about you more often than you might imagine. We know that you struggle. Many of the confessions on this page reflect that. Please don't be afraid to talk to us. We want to help."
2504,2014-10-01 20:07:37,"I'm a professor. From what I can tell, whoever runs Wash U Confessions has a thoughtful, dedicated personality. Thank you for illuminating so many of the deeper issues people tend to hide or overlook--for fleshing them out, raw and thought-provoking."

2507,2014-10-01 19:31:41,"I confess that I'm gay and I have a fantasy of walking in my roommate masturbating and then joining him. I know it breaks so many rules and crosses so many boundaries, but I still hope that this happens every time I open the door."
2508,2014-10-01 18:45:42,I stole Seth Karpel's shorts
2509,2014-10-01 18:37:43,"I confess that it seems as though people just aren't as interested in getting to know me junior year. Maybe people already have their groups of friends, maybe it's that I changed a lot during the summer, or maybe I just have fewer social interactions now that I live off campus, but it really seems like people smile for that first minute of conversation, and then can't even summon up the effort to pretend they give a crap about getting to know me."
2510,2014-10-01 18:24:45,"I confess that I feel like I have been body shamed about having facial hair so much that it's ridiculous. People make comments saying I either look like a middle school boy or look like I touch them, and I laugh a little and pretend it doesn't hurt, but it does.

We're all trying out new things for the first time, and I don't shame people for their choices. If I want to experiment and try to grow a little facial hair, please do me a favor and keep your negative comments to yourself."
2511,2014-10-01 14:57:48,"Washu Admirers hasn't updated for two weeks, so I confess that the handsome gentleman wearing a blue striped collared shirt, dark salmon shorts and a tan baseball gap while holding a purple pillow around 10am this morning made people watching TOTALLY WORTH IT today.

2512,2014-10-01 14:37:49,"20 mg of an SSRI and 2 cups of coffee each day- these are literally the only two things that are allowing me to be efficient and ""enjoy"" Wash U."
2513,2014-10-01 14:22:52,"I confess that oftentimes people say I come on too strongly even when I'm being positive. What they don't know is that deep inside I have severe social anxiety, and trying to put myself out there is my way of coping with it. Every time I hear someone saying I'm too aggressive or excited, it crushes me inside because they don't know they are criticizing the only version of me that's actually confident enough to go out and do things, and they can't see the countless hours I spent psyching myself up to even be able to leave my room. Lately that has been a horrible loop that has started to affect my studies because it's taken me longer to get out of bed to go to class, and I feel nobody cares because they wish I wasn't even around."
2514,2014-10-01 03:30:53,I confess that I don't even go to Wash U anymore and I still read wash u confessions. Everyday.
2515,2014-10-01 01:20:55,"Everyone confessing about how depressed they are, yeah changing my life and moving to a new place really isn't easy but life is awesome, why is everyone so sad? Am I the only person who's happy, even if things aren't the best they can possibly be?"

Then I get back to work and thank the world for having me and try and help out"
2518,2014-10-01 01:14:58,"I confess that I have succeeded in reducing my emotional range to the point where day to day operation is easy. I don't know about you, but I'd rather be a robot than a nervous wreck..."
2519,2014-09-30 21:59:11,Shoutout to Aarthi Arunachalam for always having such encouraging and wise comments here--it's people like you who are lights to this school in which I've often struggled to see anything more than darkness.
2520,2014-09-30 21:16:12,I confess that for the first time in three years I feel hope that I could recover from severe depression and anxiety. But I also confess that it scares me to hope that I could get better - I'm not sure I know who I am without the panic attacks and crying all the time
2521,2014-09-30 20:29:14,"I'm sick of people constantly complaining. If becoming a doctor was easy, everyone would do it.  If WashU is too hard go to an easy school. If WashU isn't fun, try actually BEING fun. If WashU is too sensitive/not sensitive enough but you don't have the motivation to do something to change that, go somewhere else or stop complaining. Don't just sit on the internet complaining, actually do something to make a positive contribution to the community."
2522,2014-09-30 20:18:15,"I'm a 20-year-old female who binge-watched every single season of ""Adventure Time"" over the summer. I finished the entire show in a matter of weeks. I will not admit this to anyone."
2523,2014-09-30 20:09:20,"As someone who's gone to three colleges before Washu I can honestly say that I don't want to smell your pot. I was seriously disappointed to see some of my good friends like that post about uplifting the marijuana policies; and I'm even more disappointed that such prestigious premed students haven't looked at any of the latest research on the damages that marijuana does do to you, especially to a woman and her eggs. I mean have you ever even spoken to a pothead? You have to look in the other direction to not notice that they've gotten dumber since you knew them before they started smoking."
2524,2014-09-30 20:40:21,"I love it when WashU has controversies that make national media, like the Halloween Bin Laden costume incident  or especially the Boo Boo bear fiasco, because for real this school needs some more press to get to the point where people have actually heard of it"
2525,2014-09-30 20:19:22,"I feel so exhausted with the community here. Everyone is so ""open"" to others beliefs unless those happen to be conservative beliefs. Then you are just considered ignorant.

2527,2014-09-30 20:01:25,"I confess that my birthday is coming up in a week, and I am pretty sure I would have no one to celebrate it with. No friends, no gifts, no parties, no birthday surprises, as what have been in the past three years. I might get a few posts on FB pages and that's it. It sounds silly but I really want gifts...even if it's a note on my door or a thoughtful, long post or picture with a paragraph on my FB page...anything that is more than mere ""HBD"". From my past experience I know this is too much for me to ask. I have bought stuff I don't need (which I really shouldn't considering my budget) just because I want gifts so badly and giving myself gifts seems the most viable way for me to receive anything at all. I guess I'll have to spend my last birthday at Wash U crying in my own room thinking why am I such a freaking social failure. Usually it's on a weekday and I have excuses like everyone is busy with classes. But this year my birthday is on a weekend day. No excuses. And what's the difference. No one will remembers except myself."
2528,2014-09-30 04:08:26,I love that whoever is running this page seems to be an insomniac. It keeps those of us abroad entertained when everyone else is asleep.
2529,2014-09-30 04:03:28,"My birthday is coming up in about a week and I really hope to celebrate it properly this year. Every year so far I couldn't because I always had exams and now interviews as well, and so did my friends (everyone for that matter). I know it's probably too much to ask (Probably is for me) because my birthday is at such a bad time, but I'd like it if someone would surprise me and do more than just write happy birthday on my Facebook wall."
2530,2014-09-30 04:54:29,"I thought for a while that I wanted to go to medical school, and I've completed all of the requirements, but now I'm starting to second guess my decision. It's becoming too late for me to change my mind, but I don't know what other career paths I would choose instead, and I'm starting to worry that I don't have a passion for anything. Any suggestions how I can figure out what other post graduate options I have?"
2531,2014-09-30 04:38:32,"After not having done laundry in a month and realizing that I actually have enough clothes (and underwear at that) to not have to do laundry for a month (I could actually make it through like another week without laundry), I'm pretty sure I have a problem. I shop to deal with my depression and anxiety, and my constant feeling that I'm not pretty enough to warrant someone's attention. I'm spending money much faster than I make it, and I'm scared that once I leave college it's going to get worse. I just can't help but feel that I'm walking down a dangerous road, and I won't be able to get off of it."
2532,2014-09-30 04:20:34,"If one more person on Delmar rudely yells at me to get my bike off the sidewalk, I will run them over."
2533,2014-09-30 04:23:35,I'm a mostly straight girl who has feelings for a gay girl but I don't know if she feels the same. It hurts. I don't really want sex or anything unless she does. I just want to know what its like to cuddle and kiss her.
2534,2014-09-30 04:11:37,All the posts on WashU Confessions about depression and social anxiety make me feel better about my own recovery from my mental health issues.
2535,2014-09-30 04:01:38,"I like getting my homework done ahead of time, but it's hard when I know none of my classmates are doing the same - if I need help I need to wait until the last minute to work together with people on it, and it seems like no one has down time when I do because they're all frantically rushing. It's like if I want to socialize with people I have to put off my work and be more stressed later to do that"
2536,2014-09-30 04:47:40,"I confess that I lie a lot. I don't know if it's because of my mental conditions or if it's a character flaw, but it's really bothering me that I feel compelled to lie even when there's no reason to do so. Does anyone know a good way to deal with this kind of thing?"
2537,2014-09-29 21:50:41,I confess that I killed what may have possibly been the world's BIGGEST spider in my bedroom a few days back (after a grand battle involving my gym shoe & lots of screaming) and now I am too grossed out to pick it up off my floor.....someone please send a premed and help an arachnophobe out!
2538,2014-09-29 21:52:42,"I'm not gonna lie, it absolutely cracks me up when I see people press the automatic door button, and then they just stand and wait for the door to open so they can walk through. I adore it."
2539,2014-09-29 21:37:43,"I confess that sometimes I feel so alone even though I'm in a sea of people. I feel like everyone around me has made stronger friendships and connections than I have and I don't know if I'll be able to continue making new friends.
I wish I knew how to form stronger connections with people so that it doesn't always feel like I'm more invested in the relationship than the other person, because that is starting to take its toll on me. I fear I'll eventually just shut myself out to avoid the pain of being shut out by others."
2540,2014-09-29 21:25:45,"I can't do this anymore. I have no intention of killing myself but something has got to change. You'd think after four semesters I would understand how this whole ""college"" thing works-- when to kick back, when to crack down, but here I am, flubbing exams that I really should be doing better on. Combine that with the prospect of having to enter the real world and the very real threat of not having a job and I'm a bona fide train wreck.
It comes down to anxiety and depression. I don't use it as a a crutch to say that is the actual reason behind me not performing as well as I'd like, but it definitely contributes in the form of nerves over prioritization, lack of motivation, whatever. Until recently, I prided myself on being super out there, friendly, and extroverted, and only about six or seven of my best friends knew that I suffered from two debilitating mental health conditions and cried myself to sleep multiple times a week. My sleep schedule is horrifying, I don't have class until late morning or noon but lack the motivation to get out of bed. This is getting difficult to hide, and I find myself going to the restroom or taking breaks in classes to go compose myself or skipping out on commitments just so that I don't start crying in the middle of shit. This is followed by me trekking back to my apartment, crying, falling asleep, waking up, and frantically half-assing whatever it is I have to do.
I was really looking forward to college, and I don't know whether it's because of my mental condition, or because I'm not good at making my own decisions, but I just feel done with this whole thing and want it to be over, to the point where right now, I'd really like to graduate a semester early. This is fun, the people are great, but I don't know if this is for me anymore and I really want out. What's more, I want someone to tell me they're having the same thing going on. People can say it's going to be okay, and that everything passes eventually, but what if it doesn't? I'm so scared of that, it's paralyzing."
2541,2014-09-29 21:54:48,As a sophomore I'm entirely torn about whether or not to go abroad. I'm worried I will miss out on things on campus because of being away for a semester and I'll be behind on a job search and class requirements at the end of next year. But then why does everyone say it's so great and never acknowledge these downsides of going away for a semester?
2542,2014-09-29 20:49:49,"I confess that I attempt to put myself into a eating disorder mindset but I have failed. I just cannot be anorexic. Restricting food jeopardizes my daily life so much that I cannot handle a restrictive diet (not extreme at all, ~1000 calorie a day without exercising) for even three days. I've binged and purged a few times but that just grosses me out.
Don't get me wrong. I am a psychology major and have probably read more books and journal articles on eating disorder than a clinical psych PhD student. I know eating disorders are serious, life threatening disorders and are not to be taken lightly. But my shape and weight has gotten into my way into doing literally anything. Seriously, a lot of people diet, but only a few end up with an eating disorder - it's a genes x environment thing and I would like to risk I do not have that genetic vulnerability. All I want is to be thin and have that determination to diet and slim up."
2543,2014-09-29 20:17:52,"Saw the other post about femdom and decided to submit (see what I did there ;D ) too. I confess that I'm definitely into femdom and wish there was a more active community for it on campus.

Shoutout to the Alternative Lifestyle Association... can y'all set up some sort of Femdom discussion group or something? Really not sure how to contact you."
2544,2014-09-29 20:56:53,"Whenever I talk to my parents (everyday since last I got here last year) they always say they miss me and want me to come back home. Secretly, I love living at WashU so much more than being at home. It just makes me realize how much freedom I have with my life, and I appreciate the control I have over it. I mean, yes, I miss my family, but i'm living up dat college lyfe yo."
2545,2014-09-29 20:41:55,"To all the people who feel as though they have no friends, are getting overwhelmed by work, and are extremely homesick: everyone starts off that way. What happens next depends on what you do about your situation. I don't do the casual Friday nights' drinks & hook-ups, which definitely isolated me at first, but I soon found a large group of friends who I can always count on for a good time. I met these friends in TA/RPM/office hours and extracurricular activities/cultural societies. Once I clicked with a few people, our mutual friendship network grew, and soon, I had a full-fledged family here at WashU.
In regards to school work, only take on what you can handle: you are in full control of the classes you sign up for. And sometimes, taking care of yourself (sleeping, personal time off, cleaning) magically improves your grades as well as your state of being. When you study, just focus on studying; when you take a break, forget about the work you have to do. Keep in mind that everyone here at WashU is smart, so don't let comparison steal your self-worth. Sure, sometimes you won't get the grade you want-- but in the end, your college experience is a whole lot more than your GPA."
2546,2014-09-29 14:35:56,"I've submitted a couple drug related confessions that haven't gone through so I'll try again. I like drugs a lot and think it'd be cooler if WashU had a better drug scene--the way it is now to get high quality, decently priced drugs you gotta be on some Pablo Escobar shit. When I offhandedly mention to some people how I smoked the fattest Joint yesterday they look at me like I'm some kind of criminal.

But for real I think WashU should stand up to the administration/WUPD's unnecessarily punitive substance policies that are really just relics of failed War on Drugs era thinking. Why should someone feel safer pounding 8 shots of Smirnoff in their room than ripping a bowl? I've done both many times and only one has landed me at the hospital. If WashU is going to sanction alcohol use, it's ridiculous to criminalize weed like they do. Yet I feel like most people would think I'm some kind of junkie freak if I said that publicly."
2547,2014-09-29 14:13:57,"There are simply not enough hours in a day, and sometimes I need to resort to all-nighters in order to make sure I don't ruin my life and fail my classes. I think this is necessary to make sure I hand everything in by the deadline, and thinking back to all of the times I have pulled all-nighters, I would've been worse off now, if I hadn't decided to skip sleep those fateful nights. I'm pulling an all-nighter now, but I haven't made much progress on any of my assignments, instead I just cried like a madman.
Now, it's 4:30 am, and I'm contemplating sleeping and trying to finish them all tomorrow, which might not be possible and I might actually fail the class in the process. but I'll go to bed anyway because I can't be productive now.
It's odd how there's this facade of safety and tranquility in academic life, while it's just walking on an endless tightrope in a hurricane with no safety net, and a never-ending shower of bird droppings, where one mistake basically means the end of your life, no matter how successful you were once before."
2548,2014-09-29 14:42:58,"To the fucker who stopped right in the middle of Del Mar Blvd before Big Bend in a 35 mph zone just to talk to a girl on the side walk. I couldn't rear end you, but I hope you get it up the ass soon"
2549,2014-09-29 14:03:11,"Current Senior now. When I first came to Wash U I was a relatively laid back guy, made a handful of friends, and did not have a hard time adjusting to the college lifestyle. Over the course of my time here, I've been bombarded with project after project, exam after exam and I started to notice my anxiety getting worse and worse. I've sought out help and gotten enough advice from counselors to fill a book, yet my anxiety holds strong and true. Now I just feel crippled by a constant sense of worry and planning for my future after college is even more crippling. I just don't know what to do anymore and I fear that once I leave this place, I'll have been so conditioned to working under extreme anxiety that I won't get better any time soon. Thanks Wash U."
2550,2014-09-29 14:42:12,This guy I thought I could potentially casually date decided to end things because I wouldn't put out...guess I dodged a bullet there!
2551,2014-09-29 14:28:14,"I just broke up with a guy I've been with since May. Last night I agreed to watch a movie with a guy I met at a TKE mixer. I was really anxious. I don't do casual hookups and I figured that was all he wanted. We ended up watching my favorite movie, cuddling a little. And that was it. Some girls might have been discouraged by the lack of a move. But I'm ecstatic. I just want to see him again. Lesson to guys, sometimes doing nothing is the most attractive thing you can do."
2552,2014-09-29 02:05:15,I've never kissed a girl before and its not that I'm sad about it or anything but I really want to know what its like cuz literally everyone I know has some experience and it feels weird talking about stuff like that when you know you're the only one that doesn't really know what you're talking about.
2553,2014-09-29 01:50:20,"I confess that I think it would be interesting to be dominated sexually. I already have a low opinion of myself, so why not take advantage of that to give someone else (and maybe even myself) some sexual pleasure. I'm a heterosexual man, so it's kinda ladies only. Sorry boys"
2554,2014-09-29 01:30:21,I must confess - I've been here over a month and haven't yet experienced Holmes lounge food or lines.
2555,2014-09-28 17:47:22,I've never been in a relationship and I'm genuinely scared of being single when I'm 30 and should be married and having kids
2556,2014-09-28 17:36:24,"I've been in an a relationship for over a year now, and now it's turned into an LD since I'm here at Washu. He's gotten really mean. Like today, he yelled at me over the phone for calling him at the wrong time (when he was doing the dishes and making breakfast). The last thing I said was, ""I'm sorry I make you unhappy"" and I hung up on him.

If I try to break it off like I've done before, he will tell me all the things he dislikes about me and be like ""okay, go then,"" like he doesn't care; and I know if I try to talk to him about how I feel he will say, ""this isn't our problem, you make problems up in your own head. Deal with it yourself.""

It's been three hours and he hasn't called me back. I'm seriously considering pulling a disappearing act and never awnsering the phone again. I said what I needed to say - ""I'm sorry I make you unhappy"" - so I guess the best I can do is just give him the silence he wanted? :/ help. I don't know what to do about this relationship and I cry about it all the time."
2557,2014-09-28 16:27:25,"I confess that when I see a girl that is particularly attractive that I think she's pretty, but I'm too afraid that I'll be called out for being a misogynist  pig or something like that. Is it really that big a deal to tell somebody you think they look good? Thoughts?"
2558,2014-09-28 14:41:26,I think the Chancellor is a robot.
2559,2014-09-28 14:28:28,"I'm a senior. I am involved in Greek life - both a social and a professional fraternity. I'm also involved in various groups around campus.

Looking back on the past few years, I can confidently say that the best friends I have ever made and will ever make were in high school. I love all of my fraternity brothers, but I don't see them as the ones that are going to be at my wedding. Those will without doubt be my best friends from high school. My friends at Wash U were people to drink with and party with, but my friends back home are the ones who I really grew up around. We have helped each other through hard times and are always together for the good times. That, to me, is what lifelong friends are.

Does anyone else here agree?"
2560,2014-09-28 09:38:29,"Ever since I got here, I've been in a sort of limbo. I know this is a great school and I am beyond fortunate to come here, but every night when I go to bed, all I want is to be home. I miss my family and friends so much that I often cry myself to sleep. It's not that I've not tried to branch out and make new friends here-I have definitely done so and have met some great people. But still, it's hard to connect when so much of the social gatherings that happen revolve around alcohol or hooking up. I don't have a problem with either one if anyone wants to do it-that's their own business. But I personally have found that it is hard to connect when you're not part of that culture.
On top of finding it hard to fit in socially, academics have been far harder than I expected. I'm not doing nearly as well as I hoped, I feel stupid compared to everyone else, I am feeling overwhelmed by commitments, and I just don't want to be the small fish in a very, very big pond. Sometimes I wonder if I made the right decision in coming here. I don't want to sound ungrateful or anything, but I just feel like I'm the only one whose transition into college hasn't been great."
2561,2014-09-28 09:24:32,"When I first got to Wash U two years ago, I was gay. Since then, I gradually stopped being attracted to guys and started being attracted to girls, and now feel very straight. Have any of you experienced a change in sexual orientation like that? I don't have a problem with it, it's just kinda weird"
2562,2014-09-28 09:39:34,"I confess that I feel like a failed college student because I haven't had sex here. As a man, I'm almost embarrassed to admit it anonymously. I would never even try to have sex with someone I didn't know at least fairly well, but I feel unmanly because I don't try to do so. What am I supposed to do?!"
2563,2014-09-28 09:38:35,"I confess that I have decided to write the whole group case by myself.  I am sorry that I am going to  deprive you of your precious chance to practice but I cannot let your sluggishness and callousness to ruin my grade for the third time.  Well, I guess you don't even care."
2564,2014-09-28 09:21:37,"I agree wholeheartedly and can absolutely relate to so many of these confessions, but I'm worried about commenting and reaching out -- or even just simply liking the post -- because I don't want my friends to see through my happy exterior.  I often feel like everyone is always posting pictures to make their lives appear super happy and perfect, but for one second, I just wish that people would stop with the facades so those who are struggling don't feel as alone."
2565,2014-09-27 23:59:38,"I applied early to WashU. When I found out I got in I was ecstatic, because I knew, or at least thought I knew, that it was where I wanted to spend the next chapter of my life at. I hated high school, and every passing day of senior year just brought me one day closer to coming to WashU.
I've been here a little over a month now, and while the first two weeks were incredible, the past few have been miserable. I feel so alone, and I know that it was probably my fault for being so shy at first. Now I'm trying to talk to people on my floor, but it seems like they have already made all the friends that they wanted.
I just can't stand it here, so far at least. I know that my problem isn't necessarily specific to WashU itself, and that I would probably feel this way at any college, but I've been so unhappy lately and I have nobody here that I can really trust and talk to.
I just want to go home and be with my family and friends."
2566,2014-09-27 22:21:40,"I confess that I think everyone just needs to stop and think for a minute. Both the ""social justice warriors"" and those who hate on them. Think about it: what are you really doing? The answer, as far as I can see it, is trying to repress each other. ""Social justice warriors,"" why can I not disagree with you? Why do I need to agree with you to feel like a decent person in your presence? And for those who disagree, on what grounds? SHOW that maybe they aren't right, rather than just saying it. And do it without disparaging people. It's hard to agree with either of you if you can't just agree to disagree, without trying to ""convert"" each other. Honestly I feel like both groups are being unreasonable because neither group can seem to stand disagreement. Can't we just try not to be dicks to each other? Seems easy enough to me."
2567,2014-09-27 22:12:41,I honestly don't think that other schools are //that// much easier than WashU.
2568,2014-09-27 22:52:42,"I've had a boyfriend since the first few weeks being at WashU, and now that it seems like we are over, I'm scared out of mind. I don't know what college is like without him and I love to be in a relationship and to be in love.  I want to go back and be with him again, but he's hurt me too many times too deeply. How do I get over him?"
2569,2014-09-27 21:42:43,"I confess that it bothers me to see kids in military uniforms walking around in an academic environment. I have no problem with them as individuals, but I would like to see ROTC asked to leave wash u. We should be focused on learning and not on militarism; by allowing ROTC on campus we permit an organisation responsible for much of the pain and suffering around the world (the US military) to be part of the face of our university. We allow an organisation that openly discriminates against trans individuals to be part of the face of our university. That isn't something I am comfortable with."
2570,2014-09-27 21:11:45,"The activists/social justice warriors here seem like they're in a constant pissing contest to see who can find the most things to be offended about. It changes the character of the school, it doesn't help actual issues get resolved, and it's demeaning to people who live through far worse manifestations of racism, sexism, etc etc than having an event whose name has another meaning that bothers you or having somebody use the wrong pronoun when addressing you. When women in Syria can drive and Christians in Iraq aren't being slaughtered, then come talk to me."
2571,2014-09-27 20:54:48,I don't find hammocks comfortable. I don't understand the sudden obsession.
2572,2014-09-27 20:46:49,"I confess that I look down on people taking pre-med required classes at other schools during the summer just to protect their GPA from hard classes.  I get it that orgo is hard, but paying for a much easier class is a cop out.  You came to Wash U for a reason; because it's a great (albeit difficult) school.  Avoiding these hard classes cheapens your degree and should be looked upon about as highly as getting a C in a Wash U class.  Honestly if you cannot handle organic chemistry or general biology, it seems to me you're simply not cut out to be a physician."
2573,2014-09-27 20:34:52,"It makes me sad that so many people are missing out on all of the great things Wash U has to offer because they suffer from depression. Depression is real, and it can be incapacitating- I witnessed my best friend struggle for a year before he finally opened up about it to his friends. He was getting help from a counselor, but I started to see a real, positive change in him after he opened up. I know it's really hard to do, but it's also really hard for your friends to watch someone they care about suffer. As embarrassing as it might be to ""come out"" with your depression, it can be equally as difficult for your friends to blatantly ask you about it. So please, trust and confide in your friends. I promise, they will surprise you."
2574,2014-09-27 20:23:53,"I get that it can be pretty cool to be in Lock and Chain, and that it's a great way to get involved in campus life and to make some really close friends. I'm also a huge fan of the emphasis the selection process puts into minority and marginalized group representation within the honor society.  But, and I know they have some secret significance which isn't this, the fact that it all too often comes with POCs walking the campus covered in chains irks me to no end."
2575,2014-09-27 20:38:55,"Washu is dope. My time here has easily been the best of my life. I see all these people complaining about how they're unhappy at washu and how they blame it for certain issues but let's be real washu has an amazing environment, better than most colleges, that allows you to grow, learn and still have a good fucking time.  Let's have some fucking pride homies, this place is the shit"
2576,2014-09-27 14:10:56,I feel awkward that I can't really talk about video games on this campus without people looking at me like I've grown a third head.
2577,2014-09-27 14:55:57,"Since I left high school and came here, I felt a lot better. High school was objectively horrible, it's almost absolutely safe to say I was severely depressed (couldn't go to a doctor because every time my mom ""offered""/threatened to take me, she was yelling at me for not doing something because I was sleeping instead), and I felt extremely isolated from my classmates and friends--generally unwanted.

I came here, and even though I had a hard time making friends, I felt so much better just getting away from high school. I thought it was fine if I still had bad days, but then they started becoming bad weeks, then bad months, and I just had to pretend like I was okay. My suitemates last year didn't help much; I felt like I was being judged continuously by them, and one didn't talk to me unless they needed something from me.

Now I'm crying in my room by myself because I was pretending like everything was okay while I was waiting for the other shoe to drop."
2578,2014-09-27 14:36:58,"I once had to call EST for a friend who drank too much and felt like she was dying. Two EST members came, and only one of them was friendly and helpful (for whom I am grateful) - the other was hostile and rude. The two very loud, very rude, and VERY judgmental WUPD officers - who did absolutely nothing but stand outside and chat between themselves - did not contribute productively to the situation, either. I've always been told to call ""the fistful of fives"" if I need help, but honestly after that experience I can't say that they have my vote of trust."
2579,2014-09-27 14:13:11,"I'm scared to admit to believing in God because I don't want people to think that I'm dumb and judgmental; not intelligent or developed or progressive enough to go to Wash U. I consider the savior of my life to be my melody at midnight, my balm in times of trouble, my creator and refiner, and still.... I am ashamed.

I seek human approval so much that it scares me."
2580,2014-09-27 14:58:12,"The fact that the culture here is strongly 'fat is bad'  really makes it hard for me to love this school as much as I want to. Eating disorders aside,  if you're skinny and say that you're fat, you're immediately assured that you're not. 'I feel fat for eating this' is perfectly acceptable for a skinny person to say, but if you are overweight, everyone just looks at you,  no matter if you've actually been eating healthily for x amount of time, or have been exercising regukarly.  Fuck fat shaming, and fuck not making me feel welcome here when I deserve it."
2581,2014-09-27 12:39:14,"I'm sick of WashU's empty, reactive activism when it comes to the racial issues in the area. No one talks or cares about these things until it becomes trendy to hold signs and yell about something you don't really know shit about. Otherwise the majority of students are content to think about the black half of our city only in the stupid cliche that they all tell each other--""Don't ever go north of Delmar!""--as if to display their street savvy and St. Louis knowledge. Stop that bullshit, it's not all a ghetto warzone where you'll be shot upon crossing Delmar. If you actually care DO something, don't just show up for a protest that accomplished... what, exactly? Maybe start by not treating a whole part of the city as something to be avoided and scared of."
2582,2014-09-27 12:21:15,"I can't stand my girlfriend, but she says she'll kill herself if we split up."
2583,2014-09-27 12:03:20,"So can we talk about how there is an event called Amistad happening on the Swamp right now? I'm a black member of ABS and we were invited to attend, but how can I go to something that shares its name with a slave ship? I get it, that's not what ALAS was going for, but still. Change the name and I'll consider going next year."
2584,2014-09-27 04:24:21,"I am abroad right now, and quite frankly not interested in being friends with the other people in the program. They come from the same recruiting spread as WashU, but are not nearly as interesting as the people I know at WashU. On one hand, it makes me a bit sad for this semester, but on the other hand it makes really grateful for all the wonderful, hard working people here. You guys rock."
2585,2014-09-26 22:01:22,"When will the far radical left movement at Wash U have enough? I generally agree with issues and the theories that they have regarding feminism, social justice etc, however, it seems like they often go too far in their beliefs to the point where they look down on anyone who doesn't share their beliefs or doesn't tolerate opposing beliefs because they, by definition must be hateful.

The last time I checked, Wash U is an academic institution, which I thought meant had an open area for free thought and for a litany of varying viewpoints; however, I find it as a place of repression by those with the most radical viewpoints creating a culture where it is hard for others to speak up or even want to talk about issues, assuming it is not within the orthodoxy of liberal beliefs. Ironically, this is the same thing that the tea party has been criticized of by the left but I digress.

I am not criticizing any single person or organization, but we need to do better  as an entire school. Realizing this is a good first step."
2586,2014-09-26 22:54:24,"Um, so everyone's talking about this ""hook-up culture"" we apparently have. Where the hell is it? I haven't found it....where exactly am I supposed to be looking? Damn you hook-up culture, I'll find you someday!"
2587,2014-09-26 18:50:25,"I am so over the random hook up culture. Am I the only one that would like to just be with one person? Seems like I can't find a single guy that wants that, too. It's made me afraid to text guys, because I fear they only wanted to hook up once, and me messaging them would make them think I'm clinging on."
2588,2014-09-26 18:18:26,"It's common for menstrual cycles to synchronize for girls. Usually nothing similar happens to guys, but I think my roommate's and my shit cycles have synced. It's really a pain in the ass."
2589,2014-09-26 18:10:28,All I want to do is have a deep conversation with a stranger.
2590,2014-09-26 13:15:29,I've had a crush on one of my pledge brothers for a while and it sucks. No one in my frat knows I'm gay
2591,2014-09-26 10:51:32,"As someone who really wanted to be an activist in college, there is nothing more frustrating than hearing ""you don't get an opinion because of your skin color/gender."" It alienates people from engaging in important dialogues and perpetuates resentment against social movements.  Do better, Wash U."
2592,2014-09-26 09:21:34,I've been on leave from school for a little while now and I've finally decided I'm not going back. I'm not sure if it's college in general that is driving me away or WashU specifically. Honestly things seem pretty high school a lot of the time here and it makes me feel like an asshole that I'm bothered so much by it. I feel bad that I'm giving up my opportunities at such a great school but I know in my heart that it's the right decision. I'm telling my parents this weekend. Wish me luck.
2593,2014-09-26 00:13:35,In my humble opinion y'all are depressing as fuck.  Let's make Wash U Confessions a bit more light-hearted to make everyone's day just a little bit brighter with laughter/smiling.  I'll start.  I confess that yesterday I made everyone in the room think my friend farted when it was really me.  #silentbutdeadly
2594,2014-09-26 00:06:37,"Sometime I wish the posts on here about missing an ex and wanting to be able to talk were about me just so that I could know our relationship had mattered to you when we were together. I do truly and genuinely hope you are happy now, but let's be friends! I beg you please!"
2595,2014-09-25 23:05:38,I would just like to give the biggest shoutout in the world to Miss Pam at the crepes station in Cherry Tree. Thank you for brightening up my gloomy day.
2596,2014-09-25 23:47:40,"That's right, I drive my honda fit in sport mode. Because fuck you, that's why."
2597,2014-09-25 19:53:41,"s alright with you guys, I need to hold off on confessions for a bit until later tonight. This deserves proper attention. 

Lately there have been a number of incoming submissions related to depression and suicide. I wanted to put out a reminder that talking to a trained professional could help tremendously. Depression isn't something that someone can just ""get over"", and it isn't a choice - but help is available. 

There are resources both on and off campus for mental health counseling. Uncle Joe's offers Peer Counseling on campus - they're available to undergrads 24/7, and can be reached at 314-935-5099. Life Crisis Services provided by Provident Inc (http://www.providentstl.org/Services/LifeCrisis.aspx) could also be a good resource to use - they're available 24/7 and can be reached at 314-647-4357. 

To be clear, I will not be censoring posts because of this. Everyone deserves a voice, especially those in crisis or who have thoughts that could make others uneasy. I will not be suppressing them, and I think it's important for people to realize that they are not alone.
 
But I'm hoping that reminding people of these resources can make a difference. And a big thank you to everyone who has been encouraging those who are struggling to seek help."
2598,2014-09-25 04:58:42,"I was in the happiest relationship of my life this summer, but it ended. We tried hanging out as friends after the breakup, and she mentioned that she had always preferred white guys. It wasn't the reason why we broke up, but it was still hard to hear especially since we just ended the relationship.

Whenever I see an asian girl with a white guy, it still makes my heart sink. It makes me feel like I'll never be someone's ""preference""."
2599,2014-09-25 04:50:43,"When I was growing up, my parents were demanding. Nothing I did was ever good enough for them. I applied to WashU partly to earn my mother's approval. The day we found out I was accepted in to WashU, one of the most competitive schools there is, my mother broke into tears and hugged me. I was so happy I finally knew she was proud of me. But at what cost? Constantly trying to live up to her ridiculous expectations as a child killed my self-esteem. Additionally, my older brother verbally abused me for years, making me feel even more worthless. I was suicidal in high school but not anymore. Things have gotten better, but my self-esteem is so wrecked I don't think I'll ever heal emotionally. I don't think I'll ever forgive my family because they are the reason that even though I know I have value as a person, I can't convince myself of it."
2600,2014-09-25 04:41:45,"I've spent so much time pretending to be somebody other people will like, i feel like i've lost who i really am"
2601,2014-09-25 04:03:48,"I am an alumni of Wash U, and I just found out about this page. It seems that many of you are very stressed with school life that some are in extreme depression (mainly because you compare yourself with others). As a Wash U grad who lived few years more than you guys, I have to say that GPA and what you do in college DO NOT determine your life. Life is very unpredictable and what you do in college is very small portion of your life. If you are very depressed because of your poor performance, just let it be!! Just live a happy life, and you might still end up with good opportunities. I graduated from Wash U with 2.63 GPA. I basically went to all the parties at Wash U and even extended my ""play-ground"" to Saint Louis University and Fontbonne University. I made friends there and even went to those schools' parties. In short, I was not studying at all!! But I still ended up meeting someone at the party who happened to know a lot of people working at Wall Street, and I ...somehow... (I know. It is very strange) ended up working at the one of the top five investment bank. I was not happy with GPA, but I was happy with my life. Most importantly, I learned to communicate and have happy time with people.

My point is that your life is not over if you have a low GPA as life is very unpredictable. If you can handle your studies and still find time for fun, that's great!! But if you can't, don't stress out!
Okay!  I think I talked too much~ Go to bed guys :)"
2602,2014-09-25 04:30:49,"The day before I left for the airport, I came out of the closet to my best friend. He told me that my homosexuality really changed nothing - I was still the same quirky bastard he knew and loved (as a friend, duh). During orientation, I contemplated outing myself on day one. But instead of making a grandiose ""coming out"" announcement with a megaphone in hand, I brought only radio silence. By default, I became just another straight man on the floor. Sometimes, I wish I had a ""gay lisp"" just so people would be more like ""he's obviously gay"" - that'd make life so much easier for me. I've already developed some good friendships and I'm afraid they'll all evaporate into smoke if people jump-the-gun. Because, of course, gay men want to tear the pants off of every guy they meet (if this were a heteronormative situation, this assumption would sound borderline rapist, wouldn't it?). Well, I could have taken a hella load off my chest with the nice clean slate I got. But now, I've really fucked up. My roommate consistently makes homophobic remarks to my face and I feel too insecure to stand up for myself and the LGBT community. I feel so lost and aimless."
2603,2014-09-24 22:21:52,Shout Out to the Wash U Community where I can forget my laptop for like an hour in the library and come back and its still there :D
2604,2014-09-24 22:08:53,I've never felt more alone. It feels so scary getting old.
2605,2014-09-24 22:52:55,"I was in the ER a couple days ago and the doctor told me I had to get surgery. My parents are hundreds of miles away and were in no position to fly to see me. I didn't know who would be willing to come see me, or who to call and let know, or even who to list as my emergency contact. I was so scared. I felt so alone.
I did manage to tell one friend, who - I'm so grateful - came down and spent the night with me. But I'm still hesitant to tell other people because I can't gauge the depth of my relationship with them. I'm afraid that if I tell my friends they'll feel obligated to be nice to me or spend more time with me. I'm also afraid that my friends might keep contact to a minimum while I'm recovering because they find me burdensome. I don't want my friends to pity me. But more than that, I don't want to find out that the people I think of as my friends are only friends in the lightest sense of the word. I don't want to be alone, but I'd rather be in self-inflicted isolation than be abandoned by others."
2606,2014-09-24 20:41:56,I could write the world's greatest love story about my relationship with gooey butter bars.
2607,2014-09-24 19:07:57,After three years here I've learned to give the perfect amount of fucks to be happy and productive.
2608,2014-09-24 17:52:58,"I honestly just want my senior year to be over, ever since I've been back from abroad nothing is the same. I'm not with the person I was before, I am woefully underprepared for the jobs that I am considering now and I am actually failing a class for the first time. This combination is becoming unbearable and I really just want to get it over with. I am also starting to regret going abroad since even though it was a nice experience I am now behind with any plans I had for the future whether they'd be graduate school or employment. It also depresses me that I've been always looking forward to senior year and now I think it'll just be a bad memory for me."
2609,2014-09-24 17:11:11,"Dear classmate, stop picking your nose in class."
2610,2014-09-24 17:35:12,"As someone who suffers from several anxiety disorders, reading all of these statuses about depression and self-doubt really ring true for me. Still, if I could get through the shit show that was last summer — literally, ALL of the shit hit ALL of the fans at once, and I had to check myself into the ER for suicide watch not once, not twice, but three times — I believe that y'all can get through this. I'm still struggling, but I'm in a better place right now. Every day I'm able to find something that makes me happy to be alive, even if it's just a really good croissant during a class that makes me want to gouge my eyes out.... Anyway,  I have faith in you guys, and, even if it doesn't feel like it, your RAs, your professors, that random guy in Whispers, and the people around you (even if they feel like complete strangers) are there for you.  So — hugs. Hugs for everyone."
2611,2014-09-24 17:25:14,"I confess that I just made a surprisingly decent attempt at beating up my refrigerator. The results: I'm now convinced that I'm a bit insane, and the side of my hand hurts. That's right, the side; even I'm not crazy enough to straight punch a refrigerator."
2612,2014-09-24 17:15:15,I can't believe that we don't talk anymore. I know that we didn't have the best ending but you pretending I don't exist when you see me on campus kills me
2613,2014-09-24 17:05:20,"I’m afraid to tell people the reason I was out of school last week was that I almost killed myself and had to fly home or else my therapist was sending me to the hospital again.
I still think about suicide all the time.
People talk about this stuff like it’s a joke. It’s real and it’s not funny. You don’t know unless you’ve gone through every day with it as the only thing in your mind. At first, it frightens you, the thought, the fact that you are thinking it. But the scariest moment is when you realize it doesn’t frighten you anymore.
I confess that I am depressed and suicidal. I take meds and probably will have to for a long time. Let's start a conversation about mental illness."
2614,2014-09-24 04:56:21,All of the suicidal and depressed confessions on here are heartbreaking. I wish people knew that there are so many resources on campus and more people than you think care about you/ your wellbeing.
2615,2014-09-24 03:54:22,"I didn't get a return offer from my summer internship despite getting outstanding reviews and I've had more job interviews than I could've dreamed of but never got past first round. I've done everything right as any serious job seeker would do but nothing is working at all. Whatever skills I have, no one seems to desire. For a long time I thought employment wasn't right for me but I think living isn't right for me. Why should I keep living if all I'll do is contribute to overpopulation? I confess that I'm really at the end of the line here. Is it all because my GPA tanked after freshman year? I've switched majors and worked hard to get it back up to over 3.5 but just barely, so has the damage become irreversible?

And to my parents: I'm sorry I had to choose to come to a self-proclaimed prestigious school and I'm sorry that all I've done so far is being a financial burden. But I cannot live with the idea of already spending so much money for education all for nothing. I've set myself a deadline. If I have no full time job lined up by the end of Nov., I'll end all this futile effort once and for all. I wanted to come to this school to have a better future opportunity to support you both in the future, and I'm so disappointed that will likely not come true. At the very least, I can make it so you don't have the burden of supporting a child anymore. I love you, mom and dad."
2616,2014-09-24 03:36:24,I've been called a white-washed Asian and I find it hard to fit in because other Asians think I'm too white and white folks think I'm too Asian.
2617,2014-09-24 03:28:25,"I'm a heterosexual guy. I'm also scared shitless of even looking women in the eye, let alone talking to them. As a senior, it's really getting to me. I just don't understand it."
2618,2014-09-24 03:18:26,Doing my gen chem pre-lab report at 4 in the morning makes me angry
2619,2014-09-24 01:08:28,No one has ever written a WashU Admirer's post about me. It's a stupid thing to be self conscious about but I am.
2620,2014-09-24 00:38:29,"I was molested for years as a kid. It has obviously given me a few obstacles growing up but I don't know that it's ever been harder than college. The guys I dated in high school I had known for years and trusted them completely. And that was still terrifying. But college hook up culture has left me completely scared and reckless with constant anxiety attacks. Most of my family and friends don't know I was assaulted, so it's hard to ask for help with the little things when there's such a big thing left unsaid. I'm not comfortable going home with guys I don't know but trusting a guy I barely know to go on a date or be in a relationship with is even scarier. Sometimes I feel like I'll never recover. I've been so successful in so many facets of my life, and this one thing has defined me lately and made me completely uncomfortable in my own skin with the pressures from myself and the people around me to date around and hook up."
2621,2014-09-24 00:52:32,"I confess that I feel unwanted. Not so much at school as on this earth. My brother's by far the favorite son, so I've been effectively cast aside by my family. My high school ""friends"" don't even remember my name. My college ""friends,"" for the most part, don't even care enough to text me back when I ask them how they're doing. In no way do I want to die, but I've been wondering, if I did, who would care? The only answer I can come up with is pretty much nobody. Life would just go on as if I never existed."
2622,2014-09-24 00:38:34,"You know that you are f**ked for sure when you realize that it is too late to change major. I am a junior BME and I deeply regret not dropping BME 140 when Dr. Yin made me derive Goldman equation. Maybe he was right about scaring off freshmen. This is almost like ctrl+c does not work in Unix when I am in a wild while loop. I feel like the only way to stop this miserable loop of torture is by plugging off power source, for once and for all."
2623,2014-09-24 00:26:35,"I confess that if a girl is withholding sex I won't keep seeing her.  Sex is for our mutual benefit, not something I have to earn.  I'm a feminist.  If you think physical chemistry is unimportant, you're wrong.  You can stick to your parents' bullshit Protestant beliefs all you want but don't expect to have them respected in a progressive, educated culture.  A girl that fucks a guy the first night is smart and curious, don't listen to the ignorant slut-shaming you hear all over campus."
2624,2014-09-24 00:04:37,"The other night I was sick, so I took a few Benadryl and passed out. I woke up after a few hours to a whirring sound. Then, as I came to, I realized it was a girl having an orgasm. I looked around and realized that I was not having sex, and it definitely wasn't porn. I opened my door and saw my suitemate and some random girl going after it. I passed out again and when I woke up I was too embarrassed to ask if it was true, or just a pill-induced dream...."
2625,2014-09-23 23:43:38,"I was assaulted. Every time I see him on campus, I panic. A friend of mine sat and held my hand for hours. He didn't look at me, didn't say anything. We were in a group with others. But every now and then he'd give a little squeeze, or stroke his thumb across. He didn't ask, didn't call attention to it. But when I went home, I cried - not with fear, but with gratitude. He'll never know what it meant to me. That simple gesture made me feel safer and more secure than the Wash U administration and WUPD ever will."
2626,2014-09-23 20:40:40,"I recently walked out of an info session because I felt like I just couldn't compete with those other students around me. I feel worthless and hopeless. I think about suicide a lot. I don't think of it as an option, but I also can't seem to escape the thought of it."
2627,2014-09-23 19:04:41,"Senior year = choose one from the heptagon: sleep, fellowships, grad school apps, general gre, subject gre, friends, grades.... -_-"
2628,2014-09-23 19:36:42,"Two years ago I met this guy and he was really awesome. He was like a genius and a daredevil; and there were serious sparks between us. The only problem was that he had a girlfriend. She was really wealthy and glamorous, and selective about who she was friends with so she never really gave me a chance.

Anyway one night it was pouring rain and he couldn't ride his motorcycle home so he called me up and asked if he could sleep on the floor of my apartment. I took him in, cooked him a steak and we ended up talking all night and laughing. The next morning he kissed me. He immediately told his girlfriend, and they didn't officially split up for another four months. It was a really messed up situation.

Anyway now him and I have been together for a year and half, but she's still in our lives. She's trying really hard to be my friend, and I'm cool with it but at the same time it kind of bothers me. I found her blog and found a bunch of posts about how much she hated ""this girl""... with a lot of information relevant to me. Red light, or what?"
2629,2014-09-23 19:24:43,"I just transferred here this semester from California and it's super difficult to make friends, especially since I live off campus with my family. I try very hard. I make light hearted jokes while waiting in line on campus and people look away. I start up random conversations with people (like, ""how are you liking the class?"") and after some one worded answers they just keep walking without the slightest goodbye. Don't get me wrong, I am so happy to be with my family again. But it gets to me after five weeks of trying when no one has even bothered to ask my name.

I don't think of myself as unapproachable either. I'm a 5'4 attractive young woman who dresses fairly well. I don't think that there's anything wrong with me. But I really thought I would've made friends by now."
2630,2014-09-23 19:12:45,"I failed an exam because of mental illness, and I'm missing another because of it too. I'm getting help, but none of my professors know about it, and quite frankly, with such large classes, I don't think they would understand. They say ""no exceptions"" in the course syllabus to the drop one exam out of 3/4/5 exams rule. So I guess crying uncontrollably and being totally unprepared because of depression isn't an exception?"
2631,2014-09-23 19:48:48,This school makes me feel guilty for taking time out of the day to sleep
2632,2014-09-23 11:28:49,"After dating a girl for three years, it turns out she cheated on me  -- and lied about it. I really don't know what to do - I don't remember how to be single, and she is begging for me to forgive her. Do I go back? Being single for the first time as a senior is surprisingly terrifying."
2633,2014-09-23 02:04:52,An extremely intoxicated man tried to break into our apartment tonight. We called 911 and the cops took care of it.... but it took them 10 minutes to get here. I used to tell myself that if I was being attacked I would get to my phone and call 911 and everything would be fine. Yet after tonight I realize that I would be raped and dead before the cops ever showed up (if they could even get into my apartment).  Confession: If my housing lets me I'm buying a gun. I no longer feel safe with 911 and my cell phone. #notgoingtobeavictium
2634,2014-09-22 23:19:53,I confess that I am absolutely in love with my best friend. I am simultaneously overwhelmed with pain and happiness every time I get to talk to him. Seeing him makes me just as happy as it makes me cringe at the fact he will never see me as anything more than a friend.
2635,2014-09-22 23:42:55,"Since I've been here, I've never thought lower of myself and been less happy.
I could've gone to a lower-tier school, been happy, not indebted myself, and not destroyed my chances to get into a good grad school, but I decided to go for a stupid fucking designer degree and 4 years of feeling like a dumb motherfucker."

2637,2014-09-22 19:24:57,Let's compliment each other more. They can really help you get through a rough week
2638,2014-09-22 19:11:58,"I'm abroad this semester and I gotta say, the workload is such a nice refreshment from what we have at WashU. Rather than spending my average week night staying up until at least midnight and sometimes much later working, I get to spend most nights going out or simply chilling and getting to enjoy the culture."
2639,2014-09-22 19:55:11,"PSA to all girls wearing rompers. Yes I can see your ass hanging out, yes I can see you adjust it every 5 minutes because you're uncomfortable, no i do not want to see your ass. Please have just a smidge more decency for the daylight hours.

2641,2014-09-22 19:12:14,"For the first year ever, I'm a little disappointed with this year's students. Out of thousands of us, I have gotten only one StreetPass tag on my Nintendo DS since I got here. Shoutout to that one awesome soul"
2642,2014-09-22 19:34:15,"When I see that my confession gets posted, I get super excited and tell a lot of my friends (unless it's a really weird/embarrassing one). I get that this defeats the whole point of being anonymous, but it makes me feel happy that people can read something I wrote and relate to it."

2645,2014-09-22 12:43:22,"I can't stand it when people order food or ask for things from the Dining Staff without saying please and thank you. I think that everyone needs to experience working in fast food or restaurants at least once in their lives to realize what it's like to be bossed around and disregarded from the other side. A little courtesy goes such a long way, and at the very least you're making someone's day a little better by making them feel appreciated. And hell, at the most, some of them might hook you up with some extra food in that half and half."
2646,2014-09-22 09:50:24,There are so many people who participate in the hook up culture but they dont realize that you actually get more sex when youre in a relationship..
2647,2014-09-22 02:39:25,I got a charley horse in my neck while masturbating. Worst pain I've had in my entire life. No contest. Needless to say it ruined my session.

2649,2014-09-22 01:26:28,"I'm sick and tired of everyone hating on all the humanities degrees. I get that pre-med is super hard and important and you're gonna save someone's life one day, but that doesn't mean you should judge us and think we're slackers. We have massive writing and reading assignments every week, you do complicated labs and problem sets. Everyone has to work hard to get where they want to go, they just work in different ways. Don't judge someone for wanting to follow their passion, because you wouldn't want them to judge you for yours."
2650,2014-09-22 01:06:29,"I confess that my life has been an excellent example of Heisenberg uncertainty.
When I try to have a good grade, my social life goes to trash.
When I try to have a good time with friends, my grade goes to trash.
Never gives good results for both. Only mediocre results at best.
But I also confess that my life has been a bad example of Heisenberg uncertainty when it comes to this:
When I try to ask out a girl, she always gets a boyfriend the next day.
Certainly gives good results for both of them!

2651,2014-09-22 01:51:32,"I have accepted the fact that no one wants to be with me.
I am living a life where everybody I become interested in either ends in pointless hookups or rejection. I no longer expect my attempts to pursue anyone as possibly ending in any sort of relationship. People want to use me and move on.
It's more than that, though. I am that person at parties who stands and watches. Listens to the conversations. Says nothing because no one will notice. I've been trained through pure social interaction not to say anything.
The worst part is knowing that I've become used to this. I find myself refusing to fight the above circumstances, because it feels easier to just fade into the walls. When I think about people, the only thought I have is recognition that they are thinking of anything but me. I have become a hollow shell, devoid of affection for anyone. My kindest interactions have become pure placation.
I would hate being someone else and knowing this about me. But I feel like my past has shaped me into this person and there's nothing I can do but live as a silent observer. Grow alone. Become a social vagabond, moving from groups of people to amorphous groups of people.
This isn't some post where I need pity. That's the last thing I need - like feeling locked in a cage of glass for everyone to see. Like a doll on a shelf. Here's what you can do: find that person no one notices. That person that stands alone and observes. Talk to them. Make them feel important. Sure, it makes us uncomfortable to be suddenly recognized. We never asked for it, and frankly in that moment we probably don't want it. But somewhere in the back of our minds it feels good, even if only for a moment."

2660,2014-09-21 14:37:45,"I've been staying away from hookups because I thought that if I waited patiently I'd find a girl who wanted a devoted and healthy relationship and who I could share my life with. There are girls who are interested in me, but I've been ignoring that because I wouldn't actually date them or because I know they hook up with other guys. And I want someone who's done with that stuff. 

But lately it just seems like everyone's hooking up and having meaningless sex. Even when someone says they want an actual relationship, when I get to know them well enough, I find out that they've actually been hooking up too.

So I've given up. I thought if I was patient and held myself to a different standard, I'd find someone else who felt the same way. But at this point, I've given up finding someone who wants something real.  I've been turning down sex pointlessly and I'm sick of waiting for nothing to happen."

She is absolutely beautiful, I could not believe that she was so lonely on her birthday. I told her there was a bar stool somewhere with her name on it and I would be honored to go out for drinks with her. She accepted, and we had an amazing night. We must have hit every bar on the loop. Afterwords I walked her home to her apartment and kissed her on the doorstep. She cried and told me that I had given her the best night of her life. I said I would love to take her out again sometime if that was ok, she said yes and gave me her number. 

The problem is I am a super shy person and I'm afraid to text her. Pretty girls have never paid much attention to me before her. Also, I have never been in a relationship and i'm scared out of my mind to try. What should I do?"

I honestly think that psych services at this school are bullshit, and its making me have so much less respect for this school. I've been having some issues lately and called psych services almost 3 weeks ago only for the voicemail to answer stating for me to leave my name and number and they'll get back to me.  Guess  what? Not a single person has called me back and I've called multiple times. Are psych services even real at this school, or is it something they just put up online to make the school seem like a good place for its ranking and its endowment? Maybe that sounds like a ridiculous question, but I know many other people this has happened to in the past. I guess I'm just saying that I feel like this is a great example of how this school just fakes everything on the surface to make it seem pretty and great and beautiful when really, its a whole bunch of lies."

I really like this WashU anonymous forum and feel like I've really gotten to know people through it and connect with them. I'm wondering if people would be interested in meeting in person. Of course you wouldn't have to say what (if anything) you've submitted, though you can if you choose. And anyone who uses WashU Confessions would be invited- whether you post, comment, or read.

I'm going to suggest a sort of ""unofficial gathering"" a week from now. I will be at Whispers at 5pm next Friday (9/26). Anyone who would like to come also is welcome to. No pressure, but feel free to come if you want. Maybe there might even be cookies!

=========================

I didn't write this submission, but I thought this was pretty cool. I've received a couple hundred requests in the past week that I've been admin, and I noticed how many of them are about how people feel alone.

Hopefully, this page helped people see that they aren't always as lonely as they may sometimes think they are. If people are brought together in real life because they found some common ground through this page, that's awesome and I fully support it!

Every single person at WashU seems to be so incredibly talented in at least one way or another. Honestly, I feel like I don't belong here. My grades aren't good, my social life has never been the greatest, and I don't seem to have anything going for me. Each day I feel more inferior to the people here and consequently more hopeless about my own future. Looking around me, everyone is super involved and always so busy, and yet they still manage to pull off everything they do so well. As for me? I've tried to get more involved and I've applied for so many things, but I never get selected because there are always so many people here that are simply just a better choice.

I've never been a very open person. I never thought that I needed to be. My parents and I had a very relaxed relationship, they know I don't like to blabber about my day and they don't try to connect with me. My friends always considered me as really grounded, the nice and innocent one who is there to listen to their problems and talk about their days. However, I'd always think that I have nothing interesting to talk about (partially because nothing too substantial occurs in my life). In the end, even though I have some friends, I don't really emotionally connect with them like how I think friendships usually work. I don't usually initiate texts, and I'm really lousy about keeping a conversation interesting through texting back. As a senior, I'm worried that once I do leave this campus, there will be very few connections worth keeping. Every friend I have will be stuck at the acquaintance phase and I'll pull a high school maneuver and talk to people every half a year, if that. I don't really know why I'm writing this, but I'm just curious if anyone else feels the same way."

I confess that I am pretty put off by the moral standards of the administration at WashU. I recently graduated and was never really involved in any of the social justice or activist issues on campus, but I followed along. I was absolutely repulsed by such actions like the Chancellor's disrespectful email to the head of the NAACP last semester (I know there is a link to it somewhere), the dismissal of need-blind application processes and our low number of Pell Grants, and the fact that we are consistently brought up in conversations about inequality at elite institutions. I know people will say that the administration runs the school like a business, it's their job, but at what point to we sacrifice basic decency and justice for the sake of higher US News and World Report rankings? It just makes me feel really helpless because I know that even if I did get involved in social justice efforts as a student, all they'd have to do is wait a few years for me to graduate."

I feel like there's a flaw in the way fraternity rush works at our school. I rushed two fraternities last semester and didn't get invited into any closed events, but I also wasn't myself so I decided to rush again this fall. I found two fraternities (not the same ones from last semester) that I felt I could see myself in and liked the guys, but once again I didn't get invited to the closed events. I know there's politics involved and all, but I've noticed that there are a lot of people who get two or three bids to fraternities while so many other people don't get any at all. I know this isn't the case at other schools, where most people who rush end up getting a bid somewhere. Obviously there's selectivity and fitting in involved, but doesn't it hurt both parties if the same group of people are being pursued by a few fraternities? I feel like many more people end up getting rejected from Wash U Greek life than at most schools."

2726,2014-09-16 17:28:56,"going through your feedback, I've re-enabled submissions on washuconfessions.com! Just some updates:

- I decided not to implement the rule where confessions must start with ""I confess that"". It could be a good rule of thumb to follow, but I won't enforce it.
- Confessions that are responses to previous submissions will not get their own post. I'll be posting them as comments to the original post to avoid spamming News Feeds. 
- I'll be accepting fewer ""question"" confessions. If you submit one, please try to phrase it as a confession! I want to give everyone an anonymous voice in the community, but let's not turn this page into ""Ask Wash U"". Please? :)

That's all. Thanks so much for bearing with me while I figure this out! Looking forward to putting peoples' anonymous confessions online.

This is a question more than a confession: To all of the many Jewish students on campus, how big of a factor is religion when considering dating someone? I realize that this is completely dependent on the person and dependent on the type of relationship being considered, but as a Catholic with primarily Jewish dating prospects, I'd like to hear a range of opinions. (I also realize that this question applies to other religions as well, but after all, this is Wash Jew...)"

At a school that is sometimes jokingly referred to as ""WashJew"" due to its large Jewish population, I have been incredibly disappointed in the fact that I am less connected to my own Jewish identity now than ever before in my life. You'd think that with so many different organizations on campus, I'd find one that would be a good fit, but I've had no such luck. Hillel has been so superficial in their interest in me when I show up to their events. I was horrified when Chabad made a very public request for my money and my parents' money when I went to a Shabbat dinner during last year's Parents Weekend (even though no one had talked to us there the entire night). The JLE group has tried to push me into being much more religious than I actually am. My parents are so disappointed in me for not being more involved with Jewish life on campus. I think they understand my hesitation after that experience at Chabad last year as well as a number of lackluster experiences I've had at Hillel, too. Still, they wish I was more involved. I wish I was more involved, too! I feel so sad that even though there are many different Jewish groups on campus, I feel alone and isolated from them all. I wanted to share my experience and wonder if anyone else has had a similar experience?"

So I watched the fat girl speech on Louie and frankly, I don't understand the point. Is it that I and other straight men (and lesbian women) am somehow obligated to be attracted to fat girls? I'm sorry but it doesn't work like that. Blame modern beauty standards. I and most people I know aren't particularly attracted to fat people, of either gender. Are some people attracted to fat girls? Of course! But just as I accept people who don't find me attractive (and I'm sure there are many), why can't you accept that people don't find you attractive?

Frankly, the whole fat acceptance movement is ridiculous...and I say this as a formerly obese individual. I became fat because of my personal decisions and I slimmed because of my personal decisions. What I'm about to say doesn't apply to the minority of fat people who have medical conditions. But for everyone else, accept that at some level, it is YOUR fault that you are fat. You have the ability to get into shape, but no one will force you to or require you to do so. With our obesity rates as high as they are, the last thing we need is to be telling people it's socially acceptable to be fat. It's not and it shouldn't be. It's bad for you, and it's bad for the society that has to cover your medical bills.

Now she does make a point about fat girls as opposed to fat guys that is valid. I'm a guy and I recognise that we have things easier in many ways. So that I have no issue with....what I do have an issue with is people acting like we, for some reason, have an obligation to be attracted to fat people."

Follow up to 1089 and 1090, have you considered that people have preferences regarding who they're attracted to and aren't required to find you attractive even if the reason is from your point of view ""shallow""? I can understand the hypocrisy of overweight people being averse to dating other overweight people, but no one is obligated to find you attractive even if you demonstrate qualities that can be considered attractive. I worked my ass off to get in shape and I work my ass off to STAY in shape and I don't see any reason why I should have to change my standards to accommodate for someone that lacks the same work ethic I have. It took a hell of a lot of work to get myself to change my lifestyle to get to a healthy weight, you can do it too. Get something like MyFitnessPal on your smart phone and start counting calories and set it to ""Sedentary"" or ""lightly active"". Differences in metabolism only account for something like +/- 200 calories a day. Unless you have a condition that requires you to eat a certain amount per day you have no excuse. If you're happy the way you are, then I'm glad you are able to be confident in yourself as you are. Just because you're happy with who you are doesn't mean I have to be attracted to you."

While I agree with what you are trying to say and am incredibly sympathetic for any discrimination you have received, it shocks me that you would say something ""[fat girls] are more worth your time."" You are sort of contradicting yourself by stereotyping while criticizing others who stereotype. We're all beautiful and we all deserve love!

I don't judge others for doing so, but I just can't relate to that lifestyle. I try to go and have fun that way but I just feel uncomfortable the whole time like I don't really belong.

All of the guys that I'm friends with always end up developing feelings for me. And can I just say it's really not all that fun. It is really emotionally draining to have to hurt so many feelings and tiring to have to deal with so many awkward situations. The guys I just want to be friends with always want more, but the guys I want to date don't even know that I exist. I've never even had a boyfriend. When you are lonely and receiving so much attention at the same time, you make bad decisions and settle for the best you can get. You're not happy just casually hooking up with a friend and you feel bad for leading someone else on. In the end, friends turn into people you awkwardly avoid eye contact with in bd.

This is kinda related to #1054 I guess... Couple of years ago, I spontaneously walked up (on campus, daytime) to a girl whom I didn't know at all, saw around the campus a couple of times and found very attractive, and told her that she was charming. I'm an aromantic asexual (and kinda asocial) individual and I had absolutely no interest in getting to know her, starting a conversation or trying to hook up--I just found her attractive. I thought she looked a little depressed and a compliment would brighten her day up as well. I was relieved to let my feelings out at the moment. Looking back at it now, I find what I did extremely awkward and wrong, and I'm pretty sure I creeped her out. Now it's become by far my most embarrassing memory.

Sometimes I really wish there were a WashU dating website. Nothing sketchy or Tinder-y, just a real site where people who are genuinely looking for someone special could go and meet other students. It's too bad that dating sites get such a bad rep with our generation - I think that, especially on a college campus, it can be hard to meet the kind of people you want to date. Even if you're super involved and/or go out and meet people, there still might be someone nearby who could be a great match for you but who you just never run into for one reason or another. Maybe I'm just a hopeless romantic, but I always think about how that special someone could be right here on this campus, but we may never come across them! Now I feel a little lame after typing this out...I wonder if other people at this school want committed relationships over random hookups as much as I do.

In any case, I think it'd be pretty cool if someone with computer skills (ie definitely not me) started up a WashU dating page. What's one more WashU-related social media page?"

As a recent WashU grad, I am no stranger to feeling depressed and stressed out about school, the future, relationships, etc., and I can't help but notice a lot of these types of confessions on this page. So, to anyone and everyone dealing with emotional issues: professional help can be very helpful and extremely beneficial. However, finding the right therapist is sort of like dating--you might have to go through a few before you find the right one for you. Don't feel discouraged or condemn the entire system if you don't feel a good vibe or don't click with one professional. Shop around a bit, figure out what you need from a therapist and above all, don't give up. The right one is out there, I promise."

This is my fifth year at WashU. I had enough good friends to do okay for my first four years, despite the fact that I (like everyone else) have some emotional issues. But because I had such good friends, I never knew how bad it was. I'm so bipolar I can be on top of the world one second and seconds from attempting suicide the next. I've turned to alcohol to deal with it, and it's working for now: it decreases the extreme range of the mood swings. But without any friends I really don't know how much longer I can go on. And to make matters worse, due to some recent experiences I don't even feel I can trust my friends anymore. I think I need help, but like my friends I don't believe in professionals. Help?"

When I'm exercising people would peek, look, stare at me because fat is hanging around my thighs and shaking as I run/jump. I once did a physical exam before working with a trainer and she was astonished with my body fat percentage. ""This is sky high for someone of your age, especially considering that you don't look like that (I was in a long-ish short/skirt that day)"". The guy I like once played basketball with me and after half an hour he was super annoyed and told me on our way back that he will never play with me again because I look so clumsy and uncoordinated that he feels ashamed just to stand in the same court as I do. Okay I've had enough people telling me that they are not nice and love your body and stuff but to be honest I'm fed up with this love your body shit. Can we stop those politically rhetoric and face the reality? The reality is the hotter the girl is the more popular she gets, and the better chance she gets anything she wants in her life. See how rare cute guys hold hand with a fat girl/woman on the street. See how many likes a hot vs. fat girl gets on her Facebook. See how being hot automatically solves a bunch of interpersonal problem while being fat is an invitation for people to find fault with you. I don't say this attitude is correct but that's the reality. I've probably went through all diagnosis under DSM-V eating disorders in the past two years or so although I've never been formally diagnosed because I refuse to see a therapist as I don't want them to tell me being super concerned about weight and shape is wrong. I've probably read more books and papers on eating disorders than a clinical psychology grad student. I know solution to my problem is never extreme dieting but to eat well and exercise and I know dieting does not give me what I want (dieting makes you thinner in the place that you burn fat first - a place which you are prob already satisfied with) but resorting to food just seems an easy escape. I don't even know what my point is in writing this. I guess I'm just super disoriented."

I've been having casual sex with someone. As a guy, society would think ""Wow, what a lucky dude!"" but that isn't the case. It breaks my heart that I'm not together with this girl because she doesn't believe she's capable of love. So I'm constantly paranoid she'll have sex with some other guy, pointing to the fact that we aren't ""technically dating"". We're not, I know. I've had the chance to hook up with other girls but it just doesn't feel right to me. She's the only one in my mind.
And so, even though I don't want to, I try my best in bed to keep her. Sex isn't for pleasure anymore, it's a bargaining chip... The worse the sex is, the higher chance for her to leave me for another guy.

How did my life get like this, and how do I fix it?"

Asian female.
Never dated - not even close. People I met in class and student groups won't even look at me outside of necessity. I'm for sure not to be classified as ""hot"" but I'm definitely not overweight.
No friends, only acquaintances. Last year I was having trouble moving my suitcases down 4th floor in a traditional dorm. I looked through my phone book twice and could find no one to help.
My last post to here generated more likes than that of all my posts on my own page for the past year added up. Like literally no one cares about me.
Got rejected in every single student group/position application here at Wash U that involves any competition.
I don't drink or party but I'm not going to blame the environment. I know people here who never drink or party and have friends and boyfriend.
Something must be wrong with me but I don't know what.
I do want a relationship and friendship and I am serious on that. I don't know what mess my interpersonal skills up as well as what messes my interview skills up.
Now that I'm a senior I couldn't even find people to go on senior class trip with me.
I'm a total failure.

I'm an international student who gets really tired about how being an ESL becomes our most salient label. Any imperfections even remotely related to the use of language would be concluded as ""yes well it's hard for you as an ESL"". Come on. Public speaking is hard, transitioning into college is hard, writing an A-paper is hard FOR ALMOST EVERYONE and please stop attributing any problems related to this and other stuff all to ""because English is not your native language"". And please stop saying ""thats an awesome paper for a ESL"" and give us differential treatment no matter good or bad. We are admitted on a ln equal basis as everyone else and we should be as capable as everyone else. Such statements, however good intentions it carries, convey a sense of intellectual inferiority which I feel extremely uncomfortable. I attended a high school in a foreign country and my classes were not taught in English but I can write and read and participate in class as well as anyone else can.

My confession is that I am a Christian. And everyone at WashU needs to hear this: we're sorry. Our greatest commandment is to love, and we suck. We do just about everything but legitimately love, and it's shameful. But I gotta say one more thing. To love is not to agree, and to differ is not to hate. For us, it's a matter of what happens for eternity to agree about certain things. Although a lot of us are purely judgmental, a great lot of us simply care too much to be silent about what we believe is best for human flourishing. For Christ, all are welcome, and welcome as they are. After all, Jesus said ""He who is blameless, throw the first stone,"" and as most of you can attest, we certainly aren't blameless. I try to speak for all Christians when I say we all have failed you all, especially in communicating that Christianity is not about being better, but about admitting how much we fail, and accepting God's gracious forgiveness to become better. Thank you all, and God Bless."

I wish some of the people studying at Olin would be more considerate towards others. For the most part, people do tend to stay quiet and respectful but there are always several individuals who decide to come to the library to study with their friends and end up socializing in large open areas where others are trying to study. Although there are other libraries and areas on campus where one could go to find a quiet study spot, I dont think we should inhibit an individual's privilege to study where they find themselves most productive just because they don't explicitly ask you to be quieter.

There was a recent buzzfeed about things Indians are tired of answering (http://www.buzzfeed.com/regajha/questions-people-from-india-are-sick-of-answering), and it was funny and all, and pretty true. Then I realized how sad it was that a lot of these were true. We don't have ""monkey gods"" and pray to cows. We don't eat with our hands because we're heathens. Bollywood is crazy and over the top, but its not an accurate description of India at all (neither is National Geographic for the matter). We don't really eat chicken tikka masala and naan every day (even though the station at BD seems to think so). We're not all smart pre-meds that only care about school. We also don't all party hard. Some of us don't like to hang out with each other because we like to have different perspectives around us, while some of us only want to hang out with each other because we can all relate to ABCD struggles. We also don't always date other Indians. Not all of us are Hindu, and not all of us who you think are Indian are actually Indian (South Asians come from Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Nepal too!). And what is that accent everyone uses around me? I don't know anyone that actually sounds like that. PSA: Every time the word ""India"" is mentioned in class, I'd appreciate it if my classmates didn't turn around to look at me, because I'm honestly just as American as the next person. It is my opinion that with the Diwali show here and other common mainstream misconceptions, India and South Asians are rather comically viewed as a foil and I wish there was some event that celebrated the rich variety of our culture (not just ""Diwali"" and ""Holi"")."

A close friend of mine is a drug addict. Originally he was just a harmless pothead, but in the past year he has begun to use increasingly harder substances. I hung out with him once in early August after not seeing him for the entire summer. He was high on painkillers, but we had a pleasant conversation that lasted about an hour. I saw him again the next day, and he had no memory of hanging out with me the night before. He forgot I was even in town. A few weeks ago, he was so high that he could barely stand or speak. I sat next to him and messed around on his laptop — updating his Facebook with dumb statuses, tweeting stupid things, etc. I thought it was funny at the time, but in retrospect it was sad that he was so far gone that he didn’t notice. I have more stories, but I don’t want this post to be too long. He gets passing grades and isn’t in any immediate danger of failing out. I would tell him that I’m concerned, but we are not nearly as close as we used to be, and I know it wouldn’t help. I no longer enjoy spending time with him, and he has no hobbies or interests that aren’t related to drugs. He deals and has some misdemeanors on his record (alcohol-related), so if he got caught he’d be screwed. What most concerns me is how often he mixes hard drugs with alcohol and pills. He’s managed to avoid overdosing, and I don’t think this combination usage has caused him any health problems so far (I actually don’t know — I don’t think he would tell me if it has), but I worry. I would estimate there’s a 10 to 20 percent chance he dies before graduating. This is a rough guess, but my point is that the possibly definitely exists. I know his parents well, and they know we are/were very close. If he dies, I would certainly be asked to speak at his funeral. Given this background, would it be distasteful to prepare a eulogy in advance? I was thinking of writing one over winter break. If he were to die while I am still in school, it would greatly inconvenience me. I have enough work as it is. I don’t need to be writing what is essentially yet another paper. From a practical standpoint, this protects my GPA. But is this moral? Would it make me a bad friend?"

I'm tired of being treated like a social pariah or like an intellectually challenged person for being an outspoken conservative. Hey progressives, I tolerate your beliefs, maybe you shouldn't judge me as a terrible person for mine! I care about the poor, in fact, I probably do more for them every week than most liberals on this campus have done in their lifetimes. Also, look around for pete's sake. The welfare state has done nothing to lift people out of poverty in this country. 70 years after FDR, and 50 after LBJ, our cities are still filled with people struggling to get by. For these people, Medicaid, disability checks, Social Security, and TANF aren't helping them make it in to the middle class, they only help them remain poor. WashU liberals, get over yourselves. Just because you voted for Obama doesn't mean you have the right to self-righteously blow each other for being great people."

I confess that I am SO NOT OKAY with the way in which WUSTL releases crime reports. Unfortunately, WashU students sexually assault and steal from one another. I wonder how often WashU students are victims of crimes committed by the black community members we read about in these reports versus those committed by other students. I have a feeling these crime reports do not give an accurate representation of what happens to WashU students. WUSTL community members can learn little more from reading these emails other than to fear St. Louis, watch out for people of color, and, in the case of this one, avoid public transportation. All of these ""lessons"" are problematic, to say the least."

I am an Undergraduate TA for a class on campus. I wish people understood how much time I sacrifice to help students do better in class, and how I go out of my way. I usually do not expect anything back, but it hurts when students judge TAs, etc. for how well they might be of use. YOU are the one who ultimately decides how much you will get out of the opportunities that you are given. Don't show up without questions and then say a Q&A review or office hours were useless, because the real point of these is to FIX your confusion if you have any, not be another lecture to teach you the ""secret answers or explanations"" to the tests or exams. Prepare early, work smart and hard, and use your resources. There is no reason why the majority of students at WashU can't get As in all their classes. People say the Premed program is way too hard... No it's not “too hard”... It's very doable actually. You just need to plan accordingly and prioritize studying (note: this doesn't mean ONLY study... do some extracurricular activities, go shadow, volunteer, etc.). Try different ways to study and find ways that work for YOU, and learn that way. On a different note, if you go to parties every weekend, you shouldn't complain about work. Parties are for celebrations. If you have nothing to celebrate and have a lot of work that needs to be other, why the hell are you partying/drinking? Just reflect on what you do and what are your habits, and cut out those things that waste so much of your time that you will never get back. Sorry if this turned into a lecture but students tend to realize how doable the majority of their classes were until it’s too late."

I admit this is not a confession, but 2 things to say. i guess i can technically make it a confession by saying ""i confess that i believe the following..."" 1. i am a dude, and i am a feminist. and if you're not a feminist, you're sexist because feminism refers to the advocacy of women's rights on the grounds of political, social, and economic equality to men. BUT i think that it should not be called feminism, because that makes it sound one-sided and make it seem like it should be a ""female only"" belief. the term ""feminism"" also makes it sound like women should be SUPERIOR to men, which is why the word is such a turnoff to a lot of guys. it should be called gender equality, or some non-partison word or phrase 2. for the same reason, the department ""women gender and sexuality studies"" should just be called ""gender and sexuality studies."" putting ""women"" in it excludes men and non-binary people. it's about studying gender, sexuality, gender/sexual identity and formation, etc...it shouldn't be it also discourages men from studying it because the word women it makes it seem ""girly""...unfortunate but true. if these kinds of changes are made, men will probably be more willing to be open-minded and interested in talking about / studying these issues. if the ""system"" works against women, then at least help open up the dialogue to us dudezzzz. peace"

After the events of today, culminating with Wrighton's email, I have never been so ashamed to attend this university. If you honestly believe that someone who is obviously dressed up as Osama Bin Laden is representative of all Muslims, then you have way more problems than can be addressed in any forum at this school. The only thing that this picture is representative of is one of the most evil men to walk the face of the earth, and the celebrations that occurred across the country when he was killed. Anyone who hasn't been living under a rock for the past two and a half years can clearly see that. I'm not denying that the student in question faced any anti-Muslim sentiment, and that fact that she may have is unfortunate, but to irrationally imply that this picture is an example of that anti-Muslim sentiment is ridiculous. To blur the line between anti-Muslim (which most - unfortunately, I cant say all - of this school is not) and anti-terrorist/ism (which I'd assume most, and hopefully all of this school is) is unacceptable, and to in turn create an uproar trying to substantiate claim as foolish as ""the students who posed for that picture are racist"" literally sickens me. This is a new low for this school, and the students who honestly believe that there was anything anti-Muslim about that photo. As far as the girl being ""scared"" by that photo, I can only say this: You go to one of the cushiest, isolated-in-a-bubble-universities in the country and you're ""scared?"" Try going to live in a rough neighborhood in East St. Louis for a day and then lets talk about being scared."

Today I was told by a fellow student to ""check my privilege"". This student has no idea where I come from, and I have only known her for two weeks, so I thought I would share a little background about myself. I was born to a single mother in an emergency room in South Boston. I have never known my father due to the fact that he has only been out of prison for six weeks of my 22 year long life. My mother raised me alone, on top of working 60 hours a week of minimum wage jobs just to keep a roof over our heads and food on the table. Even that was not enough. We were forced to illegally live in an abandoned building for a year when we were evicted from our apartment in 2006. I grew up not knowing a single person besides my teachers that had attended college. I had to work my ass off to get in to Wash U, and I don't like to be told that I am ""privileged"" by a girl that has more shoes in her closet than I have owned in my entire life. I am asking everyone who reads this post to stop using the phrase ""check your privilege"", because you just sound privileged and snobby yourself."

After an incredibly high number of rude encounters on this campus, I have come to realize that some students need a refresher course on manners. We will take baby steps on this, and start with the magic words, ""thank you."" For instance, if somebody holds the door open for you, say thank you. I cannot count the number of times I have taken a moment out of my day to hold the door for someone only to be flat out ignored. You are not the Queen of England, and, for the record, I'm pretty sure even she knows basic etiquette and would not consider herself above practicing it. Here's another typical situation you can study: if you ask someone for help in class, outside of class, whatever, say thank you. This may come as a shock, but nobody is ever actually obligated to do you anything for you. Finally, say thank you to the staff. They are humans, not robots, and you will not die if you thank the chefs in BD as they hand over your food. If you are still unsure about incorporating these two words into your vocabulary, I suggest you take a year off to revisit kindergarten, where you will study other advanced topics, like sharing. TL;DR holy shit, say thank you"

Dear University, (I confess that..) I believe if someone who has a brunch bracelet is sharing food with someone who does not have a bracelet, slap them with a $25 fine to cover your lost revenue. The fact that you get a Judicial Referral with several sanctions and some long moral talk is a complete joke and a waste of resources. I am from the Chicagoland area and I want to draw upon the analogous example of decriminalizing marijuana. Instead of having to take the case to trial (Judicial Referral? ahem) which wastes many resources such as cops having to come to court, along with prosectors and judges who could be doing something more important, they simply hand the person a fine and thats that. Just like people in Chicago were thrown in jail and had their crime on their permanent record, WashU students have to report this robbery of an omelette to med schools, law schools, etc. which they apply to, which greatly hurts their application. Given the fact that the number of people taking mental health leaves has more than doubled in the last few years here at the university, why dont you allocate more of your resources towards that area? We dont need to talk to judiciary people to hear them spew a moral talk on us and be put on probation by the university because you call sharing an omelette ""theft"". You let us in to your university for a reason. You thought we were bright students who were compassionate, and future leaders of the world. We still are. My point is you should not demonize us for something I have seen countless (hundreds) of students do during my four years at WashU. If so many of your students are committing the crime of ""theft"" (apples and omelettes and eggs, oh my), why dont you try and look at the larger problem, like why they might be doing so. Is it perhaps because your food prices are absurdly high for many of the poor students who make up the WashU community? I only suggest that you quit with your normal reaction to every problem that happens on WashU's campus which is punish students, and instead find a solution."

I feel alone here, but I am not an introvert and you you wouldn't guess if you saw me around. Self-applauding aside, I go to class for the most part, I look put together (not necessarily am put together but aren't we all), I exchange greetings with people I know if I walk by them, I strike up conversations with classmates, but I just have not connected with anyone in the way that I see could progress into a life long friendship. On weekends, I flit between social groups/frat houses/off campus parties that I am friendly with and welcomed by, but non of the relationships go past drinking/smoking/having a good old party time. To avoid loneliness and fulfill sexual needs, I hook up with a guy every so often but it does not progress much further than fuck buddy, which I am ok with. I do not want a boyfriend (btdt) but I do hope that I can find a true friend here, the kind of lifelong friend that everyone says you find in college. ""Join a club to meet people with similar interests"" you say. I actually participated in a handful last year, my freshman year, but I honestly just didn't find the ladder-climbing ""I am taking this leadership position to put on my resume"" attitude of many of the students in charge of the groups that engaging. As ""oh you're that kind of kid"" as this sounds, I am ok with spending a reasonable amount of time studying for my classes, which is another personal decision I made that I am ok with (in reference to the fuck buddy thing ). If I transferred or took medical leave, others would recognize my name as someone who left but I don't think I would actually be missed all that much.

I spent the last 3 years working hard towards 2 majors that I don't love (both of which are in the B-school) all because I listened to those people who assured me that getting a job after graduation would be a breeze. Well, the whole breeze thing isn't turning out to be accurate in my case. Although I've gone to many of the job fairs this semester and I've gotten several interviews, I have been rejected for every single job for which I've applied. To add fuel to the fire, so many of my friends came back from this summer with a job already lined up. Although I'm happy for them, the contrast in our situations makes me feel like a worthless idiot. I should've majored in something I loved even if it meant that my post-grad job prospects wouldn't be all that great- at least I'd potentially be happy in my unemployment (admittedly, that's questionable). However, I know for sure that I at least wouldn't feel like a world-class loser for graduating from one of the top business schools in the nation but being unable to secure a job. Regardless, I have no one to blame but myself. Learn from me, kiddos."

I discovered evidence that a professor had altered research results. I didn't say anything because the research wasn't anything groundbreaking, and there's always a chance that I could have been wrong. I took steps to verify that the results were likely fabricated, but in the end I realized that it wasn't worth the trouble to bring it up, especially since the professor is a relatively nice person. I feel guilty for not disclosing it, but I'm selfish and made the right choice to make sure I wouldn't lose my references for jobs or graduate school."

I hate the barrier that some people draw between those who choose to drink and those who choose not to. I personally don't drink but I still go out with my friends to parties that have alcohol, and I think that's completely acceptable. However, I've dealt with multiple instances where I've told people that I don't drink and they've given me condescending glances and assumed that I don't have any fun. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion about how to have fun and about whether or not to choose to drink alcohol. It's just a matter of respecting each other's decisions and learning to be accepting of people with different views."

I can't deal with feeling like I'm the only one of my peers with their shit together. I suffer from severe anxiety and chronic depression and part of freshman year was an absolute living hell. I was happy when I partied on the weekends, but I was so anxious that I was exhausted all the time and spent every bit of free time sleeping. I ended the semester with my GPA at 2.85. After having the biggest emotional breakdown of my life before Thanksgiving, I was determined to make next semester better, which it was, but my problems still persisted and I still slept all the time. I went into this year hopeful, but so far history is repeating itself. I still don't have the slightest clue what I'm doing and it feels like my life is falling apart in front of my eyes and that there's nothing I can do about it. Everyone around me seems to have this college thing down pat; three semesters in, and I honestly have no idea what I'm doing. The pressure of making my own decisions, and being so far from home is really taking its toll. I'm going home soon, and I told my father I wanted to have a conversation about transferring to a closer school. I've never contemplated killing myself, nor do I plan to contemplate it, but with bad day after bad day and just constantly being sad, I start to see how some people might find it alluring. I don't want to talk to someone I don't know at SHS, and I don't want to burden my friends, but it's just so hard to keep this inside all while still trying to appear sane. I just want someone to tell me they care."

I've been dealing with depression for 6 years and counting. It took me a very long time to acknowledge my depression and even longer to find a way to deal with it on my own. I've been hiding behind a fake smile and cheerful personality so no one would even believe that I was depressed. I want to get medical help but I'm scared because I don't want medication to force me to be happy. I don't know how long I can take it though. I feel really happy and cheerful some days but sometimes my depression gets so bad that I literally cannot have a conversation without crying.

I am a Libertarian, and I am consistently attacked because of my political views on this campus. When I voice my support of second amendment rights, I get dismissed as a supporter of mass shootings. When I express my support of polygamy marriage rights, I am dismissed as a sexist. Seriously, If you support the legalization of gay marriage you should also support the legalization of polygamous marriage. Liberals love to bash people like me, but they fail to realize their own hypocrisy while doing so. The government is robbing us blind and spending our hard earned tax dollars on programs that are inefficient and outdated. My ideology is currently in the minority, but more and more people identify as libertarian every day. It may be easy to gang up on us now, but there will come a day when libertarians control the government. hopefully that day does not come after the United States has completely sold its soul to China. Libertarianism is not perfect, same as any other ideology, but I am disappointed that intelligent Wash U students discredit me before they even try to learn more about my ideas."

Dear Humanities Major (I'm looking at you confession #887), From one pre-med senior, congratulations for your amazing standardized test scores - they're impressive. I am glad you have the confidence to study what you love even when the comments from your peers get under your skin. To be honest, English isn't my strength so I truly admire your ability to excel in a field I would struggle just to pass. I took a few English classes here and trust me when I say I'm GLAD I'm not an English major (I couldn't handle it here). However, as a pre-med, I am offended by you claiming that you would have done fine as a pre-med, architect, scientist, or engineer without having gone through the entire process. You are clearly smart enough to pursue any of these fields. But, there's so much more to just being smart enough (you wouldn't have gotten into Wash U if you weren't). At least from my perspective, most pre-meds are constantly worrying about their future for almost 15 months (our applications are generally sent out in May/June during the junior year). Even if you make it through the first three years of being pre-med, Wash U can still refuse to write a committee letter, which means you're basically not getting into medical school. There's constant pressure to be better than everybody else in a cut-throat environment, antagonism from others (including professors who don't like pre-meds, classmates, etc), and the uncertainty of what you're going to do if you don't make the cut. I am not sure if there's something similar as a Humanities major. The point I'm trying to make is that I have no idea what it takes to be an English major here, so I do not take jabs at the field you have chosen. Now, I expect you to do the same for me. Don't insult what I have spent my life pursuing by claiming you'd be just fine in this field. There are plenty of others just as intelligent as you are who haven't made it to the end. - One ticked off pre-med scientist."

I don't know if it's more humorous or scary that the administration blocked aWILDnight.com. Sometimes I feel like we're living less in a free-thinking University and more in a Saudi Arabian autocracy. The site promotes sexual assault? If anything, having 2 consenting adults say they are interested in one another when SOBER prior to WILD's commencement would mitigate the issue of sexual assault during WILD. It looks to me as if the school is just concerned that it might have the image of a place where people hook up as opposed to just study all day. God forbid we lose any resemblance to UChicago, the school the administration is trying to emulate and slowly move towards. If that happened we'd fall in the US News rankings! Look, if anything, blocking aWILDnight just perpetuates the idea that we, as ignorant kids, can't make wise choices on our own and need someone to come in and guide us along the way."

We were throwing this rager at my friend's house last week. There was this hot chick there dancing super slutty. As the night went on she got worse and worse and guys were giving her shots left and right. Later on I decided to try my luck and take her up to a bed room. At this point she was shit faced and I only had a couple of beers. We got to the room, shut the door, and she threw herself onto the bed. This was my chance. She sprawled out over the covers, mumbling words I couldn't understand. I knew she wouldn't remember any of this the next morning, so with a half grin on my face I did what any guy would do...I sat her up to make sure she puked, gave her some water, and tucked that bitch in and said good night.

Please read this but do not post this: when people send in confessions saying that not one of their confessions has been posted- they do not want that posted. it is not a confession. they are just trying to tell you that you need to post things without choosing which are your favorite or however it is that you choose. I, personally, have submitted a number of confessions which have not been posted but were submitted because i NEEDED certain people to see them. I NEEDED them to understand how i was feeling during a certain period of my life and believe that if they see the post than they will understand what they did or what was going on with me. I also thought that if someone else saw it, and thought it was in reference to them, it could show them how they may have hurt someone in the past. Useing one of these ""my posts never get posted"" posts as one of the THREE that you post each day just takes power away from people who NEED something to be said."

Honestly, I'm sick and tired of hearing from all of these self-righteous types at WashU. Yes, I get that some things people do or say may upset you, but it really isn't necessary to bring up one little thing someone did or said and blow it way out of proportion. As the saying goes, ""sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me."" There are definitely those events that should require intervention, but only in those cases when it deeply affects the WashU community. Confronting someone based on something that they may have done or something that slipped out of their mouth because it offends you is perfectly fine, if you would like to educate them on what YOU believe they did wrong. People will say and do offensive things and it's just something that we as human beings have to learn how to deal with. I think as college students we have our big boy undies and big girl panties on so we can ignore/brush these things off. If someone says or does something that offends you, then be my guest and confront them about it. Just please don't go complaining to the world about your problems in hopes that someone will do the job for you. If the person won't change and you do make it widely known what they did, it will only anger and frustrate other students and self-righteous types. What are they going to do that you couldn't? If you fail to change the way these people think and act, then why not just leave them out of your lives? I'm sure those people who are your friends will know not to offend you, and those who do offend you without hearing you out don't deserve to be your friends. (As cliché as that is.) In conclusion, please keep petty complaints about other WashU students to yourself unless it affects the community in a significant way. Be self-righteous somewhere else. (Oh, and, as a side note, please stop using the word ""privileged"" to describe anyone who gets on your bad side or doesn't share your views. It has an actual meaning, believe it or not.)"

As a white male, here is my perspective on the whole “privilege” thing. Although I’m aware that white people have privilege in many aspects of life, there is one area in which non-white people have markedly more privilege: the ability to talk about privilege. Often, I feel that because I am white and male, anything I have to say on the issue will be dismissed with “you will never know how it feels be __________” or “you just don’t get it.” Sure, I’ll never know how it feels to be black or Asian or Hispanic or female or gay. And no one else will ever feel exactly how it feels to be me, or anyone else. But if white straight guys are a part of the problem, at least allow us to participate in the dialogue without shutting us down. Everyone’s perspective deserves to be heard. Telling us we “don’t know what it’s like,” and that we therefore can’t even join in the conversation, is much more isolating than productive."

I genuinely envy people who manage to get above 3 hours of sleep every night because for me and others in my major the work flow is literally without end and sleep has become less of a priority and more of a privilege. I don't understand peeps who can (in good conscience and without having to worry about anything looming over the immediate horizon) just watch a movie or play a video game or go away for a weekend or whatever, and then still get all their work done and get enough rest every night. Dang, man. I don't think I've seen my room mates in like 3 days. I wish I could say that's the longest period of time that that's been the case.

I'm not a WashU student, but I do have strong feelings for one of your finest sophomore girls. We dated shortly in the last few weeks of senior year in high school. However, when it came time to move away from our city to different schools (rival schools, actually,) she decided to leave all the emotional baggage at home, and told me she'd like it if we could go back to being 'friends.' You know, the kind of fractured friendship that is quite clearly not as close nor as friendly nor as meaningful as it was before the relationship. So my message to the guy(s) out there who are lucky enough to be with her during her time in St. Louis - I hope you treat her with all the care, respect, and admiration you can afford, because honestly, she's most likely the greatest girl you'll ever be with. And to the girl - I'm always ready to resume being friends, in the actual sense of the word."

Last Sunday when I was scraping the food and napkins on my plate into the landfill bin at Bear's Den, I heard a girl‘s voice at my back:""You could have composted that, you know?"" I didn't realize that she's talking to me until she walked passed me to her friend and the guy said ""Can you stop just talking to ppl like that..."" Then the girl interrupted ""Why not,wtf, I can, and I care."" while she's dumping her something into ""recycle"". Dumbfounded and a little bit ashamed, I said nothing and left. As an international student, I don't want to be perceived as rude or lacking common sense of environmental-friendly acts. Also I didn't figure out a defense for myself enough quickly. On my way out of Bear's Den I pondered about the situation and started to feel a lil bit angry and ridiculous about the girl. If you were really caring about environmental issues instead of merely speaking from a high horse, you should have at least looked at me and told me what I did wrong in a complete sentence and a normal tone.

Although I was never handcuffed, or arrested, I once had to meet with a judicial representative a couple times. As I sat through several meetings with my RCD, and the judicial representative, they continually reiterated the idea of how I was hurting the WashU community and my attitude would have to change if I planned on graduating from WashU. They all made it clear that if I were to repeat this violation again I would suffer more severe consequences, etc, etc. Soon after these meetings occurred, I was given several sanctions including a monetary fine (even though my actions did not involve damage to property or the involvement of police) and a ""Dont Gamble With Your Future"" quiz (which by the way is a complete joke considering the fact that after you complete it, you are entered into a lottery for prizes). Because I was a freshmen at the time, I was really scared and felt like my walls were caving in. A couple days after my meeting with the judicial representative I met with an individual who introduced himself as James. Despite his busy schedule, he met with me for an hour in the middle of the week. He began by talking about his background and smiled when I told him about my infraction, saying ""what kid doesnt make a mistake or two when growing up"". Despite this, he did follow up by asking me how I would plan on learning from the incident and how I would avoid it from happening again. After that, he helped me set goals for myself throughout the semester which he planned to follow up on. It was not until the end of the conversation that he formally introduced himself as Dean McLeod and that his office doors were open any time I needed to talk. All in all, this message goes towards the administration. I understand that the few deans on campus who are responsible for punishing students will not always have the best rep on campus. You do the job that no one really wants to do. I do believe when students commit violations they should be rightfully punished. However, I do believe that administrators could be doing a much better job in terms of working with students who might be having problems, instead of against them... Look at what the media is saying. WashU is one of the most stressful schools in the country. I think you guys need to take this more into account when dealing with the future contributors to your endowment. Every time I walk by the James E. ""Jim"" McLeod bench memorial on the South 40, I think to myself how grateful I am to have met him because without him I do not know if I would have made it through WashU.

I am writing to you not to chastise or critique, but in an attempt to encourage you to curtail what I, after careful consideration, consider to be an outrageous display of animosity towards members of the administration which are not only unrealized, but grossly distorted in the public forum. Certainly, this has not been limited to any one person, but as students and purported leaders of this community, it is our responsibility if that title is to merit any worth to conduct ourselves with grace and good judgment. While you may be disappointed or angered to learn of these changes or decisions, you may not realize the spirit in which these changes/decisions were made and proposed. It is not a vindictive assault against Washington University students, but an attempt to reach a compromise or reach decisions that would not jeopardize the future/current enrollment of this university or the integrity of the classroom experience. Secondly, being a student at Washington University is a privilege, not a right and it seems, in retrospect, to be rather selfish to place our own concerns above those of a university and a community we claim to adore. I have heard many levy claims that since we ""pay"" to go to Washington University, we should be allowed to do whatever we want. But is that how a community works? Excuse the expression, but Washington University and its faculty and staff are not here to prostitute themselves to our every desire. But neither are we expected to dutifully acquiesce to the dictates of the administration. As part of this community, I have witnessed the sacrifices and the difficult decisions which have been made with the best interest of this university in mind. I do not agree with all of them and those which I feel present a serious enough offense against the integrity of this institution I have made a point to speak out against. And whenever I have felt the need to do so, I have always been granted an audience and graciously received. We do not have to resort to bashing on Facebook etc. And consider this: who else is reading these rants? Prospective employers? Graduate schools? The next generation of Washington University students? And what will they see but hateful spewing and petty bickering over the administration. If your concern truly lies with preserving Washington University, then we need to end this meaningless and divisive attitude. We need to recognize that our goal is shared and work together to ensure that Washington University remains a cherished academic opportunity for students many years from now. What precedent will it set for the classes to come that any change/decision is met with tremendous volatility rather than constructive compromise or resolution? To demonize professors, staff and the administration inexcusably disregards the fact that their concern lies in ensuring that we protect and do not inadvertently discourage students from attending this institution who otherwise would benefit from this community. I challenge you to look beyond your own frustrations. Evolution is an imperfect process, but it is fundamentally necessary for life to continue. It is imperative for this university to continue. Surely you all can understand that should we alienate those with the ability and the desire to help us now, there will be no one willing to listen when the time comes that we truly need to be heard. Finally, I would ask that you take the time to privately and carefully take all that has been said under consideration with the understanding that while Washington University has always been a special place, it is part of a much larger world."

To the person who turned in a wallet at the bookstore today: thank you very much. You have no idea how much it meant to me. This semester has not been going so well for me, to put it mildly, both at school and at home. Today everything seemed to be crashing down on me, and losing my wallet was just the poisoned cherry on top. This random act of kindness may have been common decency to you; for me, it was so much more. I am not a macho guy, but I also don't cry often. I teared up when the cashier said my wallet had been turned in. I hope this stands as an example of just how much the little things can matter to someone, and I hope it encourages everyone at WashU to continue to foster the friendly, caring community that we all can enjoy. And if you are the one who turned in my wallet, please comment; I would like to thank you in person, and buy you dinner, if you would like."

I'm getting sick and tired about hearing about how Breaking Bad is such a good show. After having this show forced upon me by my peers, I'm still in awe that many of you refer to this show as the greatest of all time. Did the last episode blow you away? Well, let me ask you this? How can you like a show that is so completely irrelevant that it might as well have been produced in the 1950's? This show at no point deals with homosexual relationships, or even has a single homosexual character. It never deals with the issue of the gay homeless youth, or features a dominant transgender main character. TV by definition should push boundaries, and this show does nothing more than force traditional Christian values down our throats. Shame on you for watching this, and shame on Vince Jillian for not dealing with LGBT issues head on. I'm honesty ashamed to live in this country now."

Last night, I dreamt that there was a protest made up of WashU students outside of Walgreens. They were protesting the use of chemical weapons in Syria and demanding US military intervention. Kit Mao then proceeded to walk out of Walgreens in full lab gear, holding a test tube in each hand, when she spotted the protest and there was a slight misunderstanding. She came charging at the students screaming ""NO NO NO CHEMICALS ARE GOOD! I LIKE CHEMICALS! YOU LIKE CHEMICALS! YOU ALL GET Fs IN CHEM LAB"". Then the entire protest dispersed in a cloud of confusion. I think the most unrealistic part of this dream, though, was the idea of people protesting in favor of Syrian military intervention."

While this is not my story, nor an anonymous one at that (the victim has already posted this on at least one public facebook forum) -- I feel as though this is something that deserves as much attention as possible. While there are many things to love about WashU, the administration's repeated tyrannical abuse of power for reputational gains is disgusting. Would the administration have cared to put effort into confronting the racial incidents of last year had the story not received a national headline? I'll never know. But I would like to know how they intend to respond to this if we can get this story similar attention. 

""I am writing on the Wash U Class of 2015 Facebook page to shed light upon occurrences as well as incidents last Spring that do not align with the fundamental principals and pillars that Washington University students and staff alike both strongly stand up for. What makes Wash U a special place and a premier academic institution in the world is the school’s strong devotion to excellence in academics, student life, equal opportunity, diversity, and care for students. That is why we as college students so greatly enjoy the undergraduate experience on the Danforth Campus. However, from time to time, occurrences happen on campus just like any other college that fail to stand by these ambitions. During last Spring on the Danforth Campus as a Sophomore, I had a tough semester. Almost everyone at Wash U knows how hard it is to balance rigorous academics, extra circular goals, as well as social expectations. It can become overbearing at times and a drowning experience. I had been incredibly open with using the resources that Wash U carries from a mental health standpoint to support students as well as further resources such as weekly visits to the St. Louis Behavioral Center to manage my own mental health issues regarding anxiousness and OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder). I also felt social anxiety stemming from being in situations around groups of people participating in the use of illegal street drugs which I strongly opposed against. As the weight of the semester began to press on me and my results in school and extra circular activities began to slowly spiral downward, I expressed self-harm and need for help privately amongst close friends. When I reached out for support and a backbone of stability from the Wash U administration and staff that I had trusted so dearly, I was shocked to find the complete opposite. I was assaulted by a Police Officer outside Bear’s Den on the South 40 who grabbed me by my back and neck and physically wrestled me to the South 40 police station although I provided no resistance and peacefully asked what was going on. I found upper management administration members quickly profile me as the “kid who wears headphones all the time”. Since he wears headphones all the time, he must be a bullied insecure kid who may be mentally and emotionally unstable and react outwardly. These were statements later relayed from my attorney to me that school officials had told him. I found this profiling to be just as unethical as racism as far as discrimination goes. Labeling a kid as a possible criminal because he likes to listen to music. The administration, particularly Dean Carroll (Dean of Students) and Tamara King (Head Judicial Administrator) went further to compare the student to the psychopath from Virginia Tech in 2007 who so disgustingly took away 30+ lives and injured many more in the most disgusting act of violence on a college campus in history. It was a very serious insult that my parents and I took deeply. I was dumbfounded. Wash U is a school, more so than almost any school in the US that stresses the importance of helping students out first. Whether it be through Cornerstone for Academics, Student Health Services, or any other student aiding organization on campus that Wash U so proudly boasts, one of Wash U’s main differentiating factors is its image as a “Student-First” University. When I looked for help towards the upper management on campus, I was alarmed to not find this. Instead, I found a few key figures trying to protect the brand and reputation of the School rather than protect the student themselves- the most important assets of a University. I found a management staff that was ready to roll over a student like a tractor and hide it under the ground not visible to other parties of the campus community. I was shocked. I really did not know how to react. As the semester closed, I was faced with further put-downs from University employees to my character for no logical reason. School employees and staff in the athletics realm also repeatedly made disgusting and abusive statements directly towards me such as “your head is fuc*ed up”, “don’t shoot yourself”, “have fun in community college” and also clear white lies in mocking ways. I started to feel ganged up by Wash U. Instead of helping me out, school officials were standing on top and crushing me. I did not know how to react, so I scheduled a meeting with Dean Carroll at his earliest possible availability. Dean Caroll did not budge with response to my allegations. I started to feel ganged up upon by Wash U employees and administrators. And when I expressed my displeasure, sadness, anger, as well as frustration to my best friend on campus, Dean Carroll immediately got me put in handcuffs and sent to St. Louis County Jail for hours until 3 am in the night. (The WUPD officer even said he did not want to arrest me, but Dean Carroll was his boss and he had to follow orders). I was left homeless for the night as my phone was taken away and I had no communication. Surrounding me with real life criminals for the night was the administrations message to me. The very staff I had entrusted upon enrolling in Wash U to help create a terrific undergraduate experience were the ones intimidating me, and literally putting me behind bars. From there, after my parents had picked me up from St. Louis, Dean Carroll and Tamara King further ganged up on me by stating that if I shared any of this information publicly on a medium such as Facebook, they would immediately expel me. They further went on to say, that if I stepped foot on the Danforth Campus, they would have me handcuffed and sent to jail within seconds. I found the image of Wash U as a University that will do anything to best accommodate and protect their students to be a façade orchestrated by two major players, a Dean of Students and a Judicial Administrator. Carroll and King ran over a defenseless student like a bull dozer simply because they could, because they had the authority and power to and the student was just that- a defenseless student. They could threaten to expel him, arrest him, suspend him and he could not do a thing about it. After coming home, I took it with a chip upon my shoulder to prove the Wash U administration wrong, that I could and would be medically cleared to return to campus. Working two jobs in the financial services as well as entrepreneurship start-Up industry as well as working with my doctor at the St. Louis Behavioral Center on a daily basis, and a Palo Alto psychiatrist, I had received medical clearance and had met much more than enough requirements to return to school and regularly every four weeks, e-mailed Ms. King my intentions of coming back this fall. She ignored them. After following the precedent guidelines set specifically by Ms. King, I returned to campus alongside my Mom to go through the steps to be cleared to come back. From there after repeatedly every four weeks telling Ms. King, I was coming back and to plan accordingly, I was met with the response that it is going to take 10 days for a judicial committee to be set up and during those ten days you are banned from campus although you are medically cleared and have no past legal violations. Then Ms. King went on to “claim” that I would be definitely suspended at the very least from Wash U. Not knowing how to react and not coming from a necessarily high income family where my parents could take so much time off as well as afford a place to stay, I did not know what to do. My family and I felt forced against a wall to pursue only one logical option: sign withdrawal papers from Washington University, a school that I loved. I was never given a voice, an even playing field, a hearing, and was ultimately trampled upon by the senior members of Washington University. I am posting this on a public forum to shed light and awareness on the fact that situations can occur at Wash U. Senior level staff such as Dean Carrol and Tamara King as well as fellow faculty and staff were wrong in every single viewpoint in grouping up and intimidating a defenseless student as well as his family. I hope that members of the Washington U community who stand against discrimination, bullying, and abuse should be aware of these examples and how although these characteristics may be violated amongst the student body, they can and are equally at times violated by Wash U employees themselves who themselves must be held just as accountable."""

I confess: I am a black person who is fed up with the arguments over white people twerking. Putting Miley Cyrus aside (proving that she messed up does not mean every other non-black who twerks is also messed up. You can't generalize her motives to everyone else), there are a lot of ""black"" things that aren't reserved for the recreation of black people. For example, is WashU racist for selling chicken and waffles? If you think so, why? Only one culture should be allowed to enjoy something that many people, regardless of race, think is a tasty meal? That's like saying we should get rid of the WUrld fusion or stir fry stations because it's cultural appropriation. A lot of dishes on campus most certainly are cultural appropriation (or maybe I'll say cultural assimilation, since the former carries negative connotations), but no one is complaining. There is not that much of a difference between twerking and chicken and waffles. Both are decidedly considered ""Black"", yet enjoyed by many blacks and non-blacks; both sometimes carry the connotation of ghetto among non-blacks and yes, among black people too. I mean, let's be honest, a lot of black people on campus have only recently learned how to twerk. Like many trends, twerking has actually existed for a long time but has only recently become ""cool"". People are acting like twerking is a deeply-rooted aspect of their culture that is being stolen from them, but I ask you: how passionate were you about twerking before it became mainstream? There is definitely still racism at WashU--I'm not arguing that. There's racism everywhere, against many minorities, and the war against it is nowhere near over. But in regard to twerking specifically: Can't we just let it go the way of the cupid shuffle (although it's a lot more sexual, so maybe don't do it at kid parties)? Is it so hard to believe that someone might be unironically interested in a dance rooted in black culture? And if your answer is yes, is it because you are ashamed of your culture, and therefore cannot understand how an outsider could possibly take interest in it? Why do we keep saying things like, ""but X was originally for poor black people, and now rich white people are trying to do it too. They don't understand that X stems from suffering and hardship""? Look, a LOT of facets of black culture were originally represented by poor black people because statistically a lot of black families are poor. That's an unfortunate part of our past and present, and something I sincerely wish could change, but we don't need to make poverty a prerequisite for taking part in black culture. Music and dance cross cultural lines so frequently, I'm not even sure why it's an issue. Should we get rid of Jazz at Holmes Lounge because jazz music was created by African Americans? Realize that WUSauce isn't only made up of Latino/Hispanic members. Realize that not everyone in Staam is Jewish. Look at the massive crowds at Diwali and Carnaval. Think about how many people celebrate Holi. Other people are willing to share aspects of their culture, so why not us? If a song or dance moves you, then by all means, let the rhythm carry you."

I saw Chancellor Wrighton walking his dog one evening, and his dog pooped on the sidewalk without him noticing. When a bystander ran ahead to tell him, I picked up the dropping, squatted down, and took a shit in the same spot. Then I ran across the street to observe, and sure enough, Chancellor Wrighton returned 10 minutes later on a return lap, took a baggie, and picked up the shit. Chancellor Wrighton cleaned up my shit."

About a year and a half ago, I was suffering from depression to the point that I was failing my classes, I couldn't get out of bed all day, I stopped eating, and every day I would stare out my 3rd-story window at the ground below and wonder how much it might hurt to jump. The warm and kind words of my friends and peers were what brought me through that. Even now I'm sure they don't know how much those words meant to me and how very important they were. To be honest I'm a bit afraid of telling them, because that would require revealing my struggle and opening my illness up for judgment from the people who unwittingly helped me the most. But know this: Words, even the seemingly insignificant ones said in passing, are incredibly powerful."

I didn't realize how conservative I was until came to WashU, and for the past two years, I've been accepting and open-minded towards people who have opinions that do no agree with mine. However, I still feel like if I want to express my conservative viewpoints freely, I can't without some damned militant feminist or social activist raining hell fire down upon me telling me that I'm wrong in my opinions. Wake up assholes! If you're entitled your beliefs and that's your truth, then I have my truth too. If I can't say that I don't believe in pre-marital sex without being interrupted by someone snarkily saying, ""Well, I guess I'm going to hell"", then how am I supposed to openly receive what you have to say to me? You don't have to like or even understand my beliefs, but I just ask that you respect the fact that they're my beliefs."

I basically went through life with no friends, thinking I was just this average, scrawny, kid with hair that never looks right. On my 11th birthday I finally found out that there is something I'm good at, that I actually am special and I got accepted to a special school for gifted students. I finally made 2 friends but life was still hard. Surprisingly, the school wasn't exactly the safest place and one of my professors was really out to get me. And now there are also all these huge expectations for me, that I'm destined to do great things or something, and I'm really worried that I can't live up to them. I don't know, I mean...

So I fell asleep on the 2nd floor of the library yesterday while studying orgo, then I recall being in some kind of an aircraft which I was sure was a dream at the time, because there was a girl next to me who was really attractive and was talking to me which rarely happens, and then I just woke up in my apartment in Cali. I have absolutely no idea what happened, but I do know 24 hours has passed, I am wearing different clothes, but oddly the same underwear, and the contents of my backpack are slightly different, including a Chicago Cubs cap, which I do not recognize. Everything else is the same. I am hungrier than I've ever been in my life, I am currently waiting for a pizza delivery and I am typing this in an attempt to distract my brain from the fact that I am starving and panicking. Thank god my wallet is intact, and so is my computer, but my phone's unlock pattern doesn't work. I don't see any evidence of a plane ticket or a confirmation email of any sort. I really would like to call American Express to see what's been charged on my card, but I can't unlock my phone and so far nothing is showing up online. I really don't want to spend money on a return ticket, especially if it turns out I already had one. I need to start studying for my Orgo final ASAP, but I don't have my notes with me. I messaged several of my friends here and back at WashU and none of them have seen me yesterday. My suite mates said my room is in the exact same condition I left it. What's really strange is I don't have any sort of a hangover or headache or pain, except for the hunger I feel great. For now I'll just focus on calming down and eating my horrible Papa John's pizza, which certainly wasn't my first choice, but they are the only chain I could think of that offered online ordering. Okay, typing all this out really helped."

Now that my horrid roommate has finally left for the year I can get this off my chest. First semester I was pretty sure that you had be swiping my alcohol and food. Food isn't that big of a deal but the alcohol was, in general, not that cheap. You had this ""creative"" plan where you would only grab the beer in the back or you would refill the hard stuff with water, as if I wouldn't notice 6 beers gone because the front row was in order. I confronted you about it a few times, but it was still a problem. Then, after Thanksgiving, I came back with some really nice imported beer my cousin had brought back for me and I specifically asked you to leave them alone. Next weekend comes and theres only 1 left. That was the last straw. I had to do something. When I can back from Winter Break i brought all the beer (about 45) that wasn't drank from my Memorial Day (7 months ago) and I would put that in the fridge. Also, I replaced the hard alcohol with pickle juice. That's right, you've been drinking old beer and pickle juice (I hid my stuff in a cooler under the bed). I'm pretty sure you figured out the pickle juice was pickle juice after you had 3 shots of it, but I digress. I hope you learned your lesson champ."

Oh, how easy it is to fall into the ruts formed by months of the daily grind of life, be it the class work, the extracurriculars, the worries about my future. Every day I forged habits, chained to my daily routine. Wake up, class, work, a drink here and there, but days molded into weeks, molded into months, molded into my year here at WashU. Today, something was different. As my roommate had left the week before, I was left with myself, my introspection... my curse? It wasn't neither the dreary weather nor my pressing schoolwork that led me to an epiphany. Working in my room, halfway through an essay due far too soon, I took a bathroom break, thanks to my four cups of coffee before noon. Like a machine, I made my way to the bathroom, and walked in. I can't say I made the conscious decision to do it, but my habit moved my arm, grabbed the doorknob, and shut the door behind me. That was when I had my epiphany. How many times had I gone through the same routine without stopping to ask myself the true meaning of my movements? I was a slave to habit, but the past tense ""was"" is my choice to change. Slowly I reached. It felt foreign. It felt absurd. How could I do this? How could I look my Catholic priest in the eyes ever again? Sitting there, I nervously opened the door. The feeling of liberty flowed in with the breeze from our central air. In an instant my perception of life changed and, breaking the bonds of my shackles of habit, I was jolted out of my routine like a Green Mile inmate. This? This is true freedom. I have to confess, it felt kinda weird though so I closed the door after a few seconds."

Every time I have sought help at SHS, they have cancelled my appointment because other students needed them more, which only makes me more convinced that I am worthless as a person. To my friends, I appreciate your support and I am sorry that I am such a piece of shit."

I really just want a girl to go see a movie with me. Just once I want to go on a date with a Wash U girl, and I'm pretty much out of time. Friends tell me I'm attractive and funny, so my inability to get any girls to even talk to me is probably because I'm a failure as a human being. Can someone explain where I've gone so wrong?"

All fraternity and sorority presidents just received this e-mail: ""Chapter Presidents, House Managers and IFC Execs: (Sorority presidents and WPA this information should probably be made available to your members as well) As you are all aware, WILD will be here tomorrow (Friday) and I want to make sure we are all on the same page regarding expectations of the chapters and activities at fraternity houses. Make sure your members are aware of everything in this email please. Res Life, WUPD and members of our staff will be doing rounds by the fraternity houses and all Res Life areas during the day and during WILD itself. Jon – Please make sure the members of ZBT are aware of this information as well as they come onto campus and because there should not be anything happening at the house or apartments off-campus. NEW INFORMATION: There is a very large and important event occurring in the Knight Center from 4:30-6:30pm. You can be assured that all administrators will be attending at least a portion of this event and as they are going to and from the Knight Center, they will be by the Upper Row. This means that everyone will be within earshot of the fraternities (and House 1) so we’re really not kidding about the “no outside music” stipulation below. It will be very easy to draw attention because of the location of this event so PLEASE be smart and comply if WUPD or a staff member addresses your chapter. Another key thing to remember is that noise could become an issue by the Knight Center as your members walk to the Quad. There may be a B&D guard posted by house 1 and the Law School to direct the flow of traffic away from the Knight Center entrance to the other side of Mudd Field. I would strongly encourage you to have multiple sober contacts at the house and if you are not someone that we can ask for if something comes up, send me the name and cell phone number of who will be present and can address situations if they come up. Please also remind your chapter members (and any potential guests) that Walk In Chow Down is on the South 40 from 2-5pm…so people should go over there and get food and hang out. Our expectation is also that you will strongly encourage anyone in/around the upper and lower row to head down to WILD at 5:30pm when the doors open and to stay down there for the duration of the show or at the very least, not use your houses as an alternative venue for activities that night. People will still be walking the row during WILD so the expectation of no parties or large gatherings will be in place the entire night. To avoid any issues please know the following (Yes, this is the same information I sent you last semester…read it again please): · No music outside – that will naturally draw people to your house because they will assume something is going on. Once they get to your house, you know they will try to enter or will draw the attention of more people that you likely don’t want to have to deal with. (This also means no music should be heard outside through windows) · Do not prop open doors…it again will bring attention to your house and others will assume it is an open invitation to enter your house. · Be smart about what you bring outside. IF 20 members are sitting on the porch…all with Big Gulp cups…might draw some attention. Just be smart and use common sense. · If we see groups of people entering your house (like more than 5 at a time) that will draw attention and lead us to believe that something is going on inside the house when it shouldn’t be. This will result in one of us asking to talk to you and then entering your house to check the situation. · We’ll be asking groups of people standing around outside to move along if it appears that they don’t live in the houses and that they aren’t really there for any real purpose. If they then decide to settle on your porch to avoid having to leave, feel free to also ask them to move along J · If we come up to any house and have concerns (large gatherings outside, members bringing in large amounts of alcohol, groups of people entering your house, loud noise coming from the house that would indicate a party is going on, etc) you will get one warning and be asked to clear things out. If it needs to be addressed a second time during the day/night, things will again be shut down and you’ll have a report written up. · Just be smart. WILD is not a time when you or your members are responsible for entertaining the entire campus, so don’t feel any pressure to do so! I want you and your members to have fun…but part of that fun should include not having to deal with me at any point during the night unless it is a friendly chat about how great the weather is! I won’t be confronting anyone or entering houses unless I have GOOD reason to do so. Most of those reasons are listed above. Others would include a cloud of marijuana smoke coming from your house or other obvious illegal activities – which I am more than confident we will NOT have to worry about this year. · Also be aware that because programming ends this week, the Greek Life Standards Board will not be meeting. So any reports will be handled administratively by SIL staff members. The actions of seniors are also included in this…so yes, they could do something that your chapter has to pay the price for even if they are gone – make sure they are aware of this. They also should know that issues that come up this weekend could impact their involvement with Senior Week. Let me know if you have any questions and enjoy the rest of your week!"" I'm not allowed on my porch or allowed to play music outside on the one day party we're allowed all year? Further, I'm not allowed to invite my friends over to my residence in groups larger than 5. Regardless of your views on Greek Life, I hope everyone can agree that these impositions on pretty reasonable expectations of freedom are ridiculous. And they've slowly been increasing in frequency and become increasingly institutionalized with each passing year."

I confess that I am ashamed of the wealth of this school when I look at the facades at Thurtene. To clarify, I am not talking about the carnival part itself. Though I am skeptical about the honorary, I recognize the good that the carnival aspect (the rides, funnel cakes etc) do for the school regarding community relations, and that the carnival is a long tradition on campus. The facades are a disgusting display of wealth and should be disbanded for the coming year. I am a member of one of the groups that builds a facade and it is an incredible waste of resources and man power. To begin each facade costs and extraordinary amount of money. We spend hours and hours building them (often neglecting school work and other responsibilities) and then we just tear them down. If we as a community spent our time building houses in intercity St. Louis rather than building them for three days and then tearing them down, we could do a lot of good for the city."

it pisses me off when people complain about SHS. These people are doctors with their medical degrees. Half of you are gonna be doctors someday and may just be working in a college infirmary too. Coming from someone who has had tons of medical problem (also im bschool btw--not some administrator, shs doctor, or have any relationship to an shs doctor) theyve been a big help. So for those of you who cite their complaints as being ""i went to them with food poisoning and they told me to drink water"" well there's not much else you couldve done. And for those of you who go to shs because you have a cold- you deserve to be told just to sleep it off. And dont complain that they didnt detect your sinus infection or couldnt figure out what was wrong with your throat. Odds are, if they couldnt find it, your doctor at home wouldnt have been able to either and you wouldve had to go to some specialist anyway. Moral of my rant-- get your facts straight before you complain about someone and potentially put their job in jeopardy- as well as the health of those who are too afraid to trust shs because of your complaints."

i really wish I had gone greek.. my friendships with my friends who joined fraternities has deteriorated every semester since spring of freshman yr and i miss out on events. For example. kappa karaoke seems really fun and I wish I had a just to experience that. I wish i got to go to formals. I wish I could get to know more people (guys and girls). I feel left out of events like Linus and even just going out on the weekends. not going greek is my biggest regret of college. It really prevented me having the best time of my life."

When I was in Mexico over Spring Break, I bought cocaine from a coconut seller. I didn't look for a coke dealer; all I wanted was a coconut. While I was eating the coconut that I bought from him, he asked me if I wanted marijuana, mushroom, cocaine, and heroin in that order. Clearly, if I don’t want marijuana, I want to shoot up heroin. Being a curious person, I wanted to know what the price of coke was in rural Mexico. One thing led to another, and we reached a deal. Half of a gram of la coca for 100 pesos (8 bucks) (I mean, I didn’t think that it would be thaaaat cheap.. the dude started from 500 pesos). He told me that he’ll get the coke and that he’ll meet me on the beach in an hour. But as soon as I made the deal, I began regretting it. I’m totally down for trying new things, but snorting some unknown white powder that could just easily be crushed glass as it could be a very highly addictive substance that some opportunistic coconut and drug dealer on a nudist Mexican beach sells me scared me. So I avoided the beach and moved on to the next village the next day. Sometimes, I feel like a bad person for not following through on the deal. He was so excited to make the coke sale to a “chino.” Maybe I should have let him overcharge me for another coconut as a peace offering."

Cheating is a cruel, cowardly thing. It has the potential not only to break the heart of one victim, but three. I cheated on someone I truly loved, and I will regret it every day of my life. But this post is not about me: I want to respond to the 'friend' who recently posted. First off, to show concern is a legitimate reaction. NO ONE ever deserves to be cheated on, and I think the boyfriend has a right to know. That being said, I think it best for you to approach your friend before you make any moves. People do cowardly things like cheating as a cry for help, or because they naively don't realize the consequences/gravity of their actions. This doesn't make it right, but I think you should give your friend the opportunity to 'right' as much wrong, herself, as she can. I'm sure she does not feel good about herself and is in denial and/or afraid to make those moves, and using avoidance as a coping mechanism to reduce cognitive dissonance. We, as a culture, condemn cheaters, and rightfully so, but may fail to realize the internal conflict of a cheater and easily write them off as if the act of cheating alone reflects their character. If this girl is truly your friend, I'm sure she is your friend for a reason (i.e. has redeeming qualities) and will come to see what's right with a little of your help. Good luck."

I want to share my views on the depression debate, as somebody who was diagnosed with clinical depression almost a year ago. When I posted my confession, the last thing on my mind was how it would make the school look. I am sorry if it turned anybody off of Wash U, that wasn't my intention. Its not fair to judge a school based on a few unhappy people, because every school faces these issues. Instead, look at the response. Complete strangers giving their phone numbers for support. Only a few childishly dismissed the ""whiners"". Depression happens everywhere, and the measure of a school is how it reacts. By this standard I am proud of Wash U."

A friend of mine broke up with his girlfriend recently. I don't know her well, but we've talked a few times, and she seems neat. She's really upset over it, and I tried to be supportive and be there for her. But, then she told me that the two of them are trying to get back together, and she's hoping it will work. But, I know from talking to my friend that he doesn't want to get back with her, he's only trying to make her less upset, and he told me not to tell her. It seems wrong to watch her hope for something I know won't happen, but I don't know what else to do."

What Wash U Confessions has become: Original poster - ""I don't like (fill in group) for the following reasons: (either someone was an asshole or insensitive)."" Comments: 1. Student in agreement: ""Yeah (group being criticized) sucks!"" -----gets <5 likes. 2. Angry member of that group: ""You don't know us! And you're such a coward for posting anonymously!"" ----- 10-25 likes. 3. Over-confident sarcastic fraternity member: (fill in comment about how awesome Greek life is here). ------- 20 likes all from Greeks 4. Random person: (fill in sexual and probably somewhat perverted comment here) -------- 50 likes So what we have learned os that everyone posts the same shit all the time. Not everyone is going to like every group, and whether you attack or defend a group doesn't make you a bigger person. You're still sitting behind a computer screen like everyone else.

Talking for all Wash U athletes, we do not come here for the notoriety. We come here because we love the game. If you think any differently, you do not really know us. We have all the opportunities similar to you, less time to study but yet we are in the same classes. All of us could have gone to a state school, got a decent education and just partied all the time. Instead, we decided to continue to the play the game we love. Would it be nice if more people came to games, sure. But we do not play so we are the celebrities on campus, we play to bring Wash U honor and bring championships to this school."

The one thing I dislike most about this school is that there is no sports culture. We have good teams but besides the few times some teams are entered into national tournaments I feel like sport events aren't that big of a deal. I know it isn't for everyone but I cannot help but feel jealous of my friends who go to state schools and tailgate football games or my friends at Duke (a great academic school that is smaller and ranked higher than us) who get to watch their team play in the March Madness tournament. Even Emory which is also D-III has a better sports culture than us. As I am reflecting on my past four years"

To all those people judging Washu based on this page, think of it this way these comments/opinions are obviously not popular opinions or they wouldn't be ""confessions."" If the majority of people were unhappy or disappointed with the social scene a confession would be ""I went to a really great party last night"" or ""I actually really like the nightlife here."" Posters wouldn't need to be anonymous if they felt comfortable expressing these opinions. And also they shouldn't be criticized for sharing negative opinions of Washu. People need a way to express their feelings, and if this is the only way they can then let them. Everybody needs something/someone to turn to."

I am a sophomore in college and today I found out that I am a father. Yes, you read that correctly, a father. My daughter was born today, her name is Sarah and she weighs 6 pounds, 3 ounces. Her mother, a girl I met at a party nearly 11 months ago back home, called me today to tell me the news. She called me, told me the baby was mine, and that she was going to attempt to raise it. A baby. MY baby. I can't believe this news and I'm struggling to comprehend what has happened to me. I am just a sophomore in college. I drink 4 nights a week and I'm irresponsible as shit. I hook up with random girls and I never talk to them again. I'm failing 3 of my classes and I'm already on probation with the school. I have no idea what I am doing with my life, and I think I might be an alcoholic/ addicted to other drugs. And today, I found out that I'm a fucking father. My daughter, my own flesh and blood, was born today, and I am in absolutely no state to be able to take care of her or support her mother. I don't know what to do, this news has changed the entire course of my life. I need help, I can't deal with this."

I'm busier than I've ever been, taking on more work than I can ever do. I'm always at a loss for time. But you know what? I'm so happy doing it. I have plenty of things to complain about, that I'm sure others would complain about (workload, ""bad vibe"" of the school, whatever the other 600 confessions have been about). But every single thing I'm doing, I get to do because I genuinely want to do it. Even classes I ""have"" to take, there's quotes around it because I chose to do it. Complain all you want, but I could go on and on about all the things I study, but even longer about the things I want to study. Not everyone gets this chance, I'm just grateful that I get to have it. I guess I confess that it's discouraging to see so many others complain about having so much."

As a participant in CGI-U this weekend, I was walking past frat row with hundreds of other participants (from all 50 states and 75 countries) when some frat brothers hanging out in the Kappa Sig patio started yelling juvenile insults like ""NERDS"" and ""WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?"" Not only was it stupid and childish, but it was an extremely poor way to represent this university to 1,000 students who are going to judge WashU and tell other people about it based on the weekend that they spent here. Whoever you are, you may think that's funny, and that the students walking by were ""nerds"", but they are also some of the most amazing people I have ever met. These students are doing everything from curing rampant infant diseases in developing countries to providing an education to children who don't have access to one to recycling materials into beds for the homeless. They're not just talking about these things, they're DOING THEM. I was humbled by every minute. It's sad because you just yelled your insults at the world leaders of the future, the people who will solve so many of the problems that we face in today's world. The things they are doing are benefitting this world and benefitting YOU and you should appreciate that. You should also be representing WashU to these students in the best possible light, not one of immaturity and lack of consideration. Do better."

Although this doesn't affect everyone at Wash U, I feel like I have to say this. I feel like the LGBT community at Wash U is totally noninclusive. If you don't know anyone or you are not totally and flamboyantly out, then it's incredibly difficult to make friends. The community is very cliquey and quick to dismiss people. We face social isolation in so many ways throughout society, we don't need it in a place where we should all feel comfortable. I wish I could say that I feel welcome, but I don't."

I was admitted ED to WashU this year, and cried from excitement. I loved every single aspect of this school and I felt so happy and blessed so be accepted to a first rate, beautiful, and rigorous school next year. Due to WashU Confessions, though, I don't feel as excited anymore. All anyone does, it seems, is complain, argue, and talk about how miserable the social life is and how difficult premed is. I can't help but feel I will soon relate to the depressed kid who doesn't fit in with the Greek-dominated social scene, and to the kid who is struggling to maintain straight Cs. Nothing any current student has said has given me any hope about having a bright and happy future next year. Call me weak, dumb, closed minded, or scared, but if I weren't bound to this school I would probably pick somewhere else. Think about what you say on this page because it certainly reflects on the school as a whole, in an incredibly negative way."

As much as I've come to love WashU, I still can't stand the pre-med vibe of this place.

It seems like the culture here is all about just procrastinating, complaining about how difficult tests are (which they normally aren't, by the way), then just getting smashed on the weekends to forget about it all.

i can't stand people at the gym who have no idea what they're doing. working abs is essentially pointless, you don't get a 6 pack/killer abs from ""toning"" you get it from having a low body fat % (usually around 10 - 14%). in fact, ""toning"" and ""spot reduction"" are myths. fat loss is caused by a caloric deficit in your diet aka spending more than you're taking in - cardio is useful for this. machine work is a joke. throwing weights around with piss poor form is only gonna get you hurt. if you don't do reps with a full range of motion, it doesn't count you pansy. low rep ranges (1 - 6 or so) are best for building strength, medium rep ranges ( 7 - 13 or so) are best for building muscle mass, and higher rep ranges are best for increasing endurance. you wanna get big and strong??? lift big eat big, also sleep big.

I visited over 20 universities across the country over the course of my senior year in high school. For the life of me I just couldn't pin down where I wanted to spend the next four years of my life learning and making friends and experiencing life outside my region of familiarity. I arrived at WashU in mid-November with my Momma and a folded up map of the area. I was looking for a sign, any sign that this might be the place for me. I was getting desperate as so many of my classmates seemed to already have filled out the early-decision apps and everything. We started our tour and the university felt nice. Nothing special, they seemed to give the same general spiel as most places I had been. And then, just as we were passing the bunny statue, a small bird hopped off of one of the statue's ears and soared directly overhead like a glorious B-2 bomber. Also like a B-2, it dropped a nuclear bomb-sized shit on my head. That was when I knew. In that moment I was euphoric, I was infinite, I was covered in bird shit. God had given me the sign I had been waiting for. So now I'm a sophomore at WashU. I'd like to say it was because I fell in love with the campus or the students or the food or any other part of WashU, when in reality I made my decision because a dickbag bird decided to take a dump on my dome (can anyone say ALLITERATION whaaaaaaaaaaaat). Regardless, I made the right decision and I couldn't be happier I made the decision to come here."

A year ago, I was drugged and raped. I don't remember anything and I don't know who it was--I woke up the next morning, grabbed my shit, and left before he got up. Since then, I've walked around campus wondering if I'm in the same room as my rapist, if he's in any of my classes, if he may have graduated or gotten kicked out (part of me hopes he did), if I've ever spoken to him and if he knows who I am. Part of the reason I'm submitting this is because I'm tired of hiding it and I want people to know. Keeping this secret has been destroying me for the past year. Finally, I'm at peace with it. I don't blame myself, I don't think I'm a slut, and I'm not looking for help. I'm healing, and ready to take action, if nothing more yet than anonymous action. So the other part of the reason is for awareness. People try to bring up sexual assault time and time again but I feel like no one listens on this campus. Wash U's hookup culture, while it can be fun, isn't for everyone, and it can be dangerous. Because it is more or less assumed that everyone wants to hook up all the time, we don't seek the consent that we should and the percentage of people, not just women, who have been subjected to nonconsensual and forced sexual encounters is remarkably high. Date rape drugs are more rampant than we realize. This is heartbreaking to me and we can't let this keep happening. Stand with me and fight it. Hopefully I'll find the courage to speak publicly but this is the best I can do right now, so we need to work together for my sake, for the sake of everyone else who is a victim, and for the sake of everyone who will be a victim if we don't address this problem."

As a junior this year, I feel like its become impossible for me to form new close friendships, and at the same time, I'm losing contact with more and more of the people I used to know at this school. Everyone has already formed these impenetrable cliques, whether its through greek life, student groups, the people they live with, etc. At this point, its much too late for greek life. While there are tons of student groups, I have yet to find one that genuinely interests me, and even if I did, it would still be unlikely that i would form true friendships at this point, because it seems like everyone already knows everyone else, and i have no hope of entering their well established circle of friends. Parties and bars are pretty much just as hopeless for finding meaningful friendships. To be clear, Im talking about people to just chill with, have good conversation with, do social stuff etc. and most importantly, people who actually give a fuck that I exist. I know these people are out there, I just cant seem to find them, in spite of constantly putting myself out there and pushing myself to be social and going well outside of my comfort zone. two and a half years at this school and i have nothing to show for it but mediocre grades and debt and a major that doesn't even have any practical value. *please, no ""first world problem"" or ""quit bitching"" type comments, I simply want practical advise so that I can get the most out of what little time left I have left at Wash U."

I can't focus, my appetite's shit, I don't enjoy anything, I can't sleep like a normal human being, and my moods swing like the f****** heart monitor of a rabbit in a minefield. Yet, I STILL will not go to SHS... So many people have told me about horrible experiences there that I can't trust them with my mental health, even though, at this point, I can't trust myself either."

Last year I had some local friends over, and they brought some friends that go to Fontbonne. One of my WashU friends made some disparaging joke about the quality of students and education at Fontbonne, and it helped me to realize just how mean it is to trash talk a school because they are not of the same calibre as WashU. The pursuit of education is admirable on any level, and I would expect WashU students to support through their words and actions anyone looking to better themselves."

3362,2013-03-23 09:10:15,"sion #469

i would really, really appreciate if you publish this. thanks. An open letter to CS40 To Whom It May Concern: I am very disappointed in your organization as a whole in the way that you handled the distribution of the Macklemore tickets for this Sunday. Let me begin by first saying that I have no issue with the fact that the concert had to be moved from the South 40 to the Pageant. There are few things in life that are totally out of our control, and weather is probably first and foremost on that list. In fact, I actually applaud your efforts on finding another reasonably large venue so close to campus on what must have been very short notice. Outside of that, however, the situation was handled very poorly, in my opinion. Like many (but apparently not all) students, I received an email at 2:41PM about the location change for Sunday and the 2,000-ticket limit that went along with it. I read the email thoroughly because I wanted to make sure I got a ticket as I have been looking forward to this event all year. One important line from the email was this: “Tickets will be available (first come first serve basis): WashU ID REQUIRED 1 ticket per person.” I interpreted this as follows: since some guest tickets had already been sold (I estimated maybe 400) and since some tickets were probably reserved for the people planning the event (generously, maybe 100), I thought that as long as I was one of the first 1,500 people in line I would have no problem getting a ticket, since there was a 1 TICKET PER PERSON LIMIT (as there should be). Still, I wanted to be sure. So I went to the Res. Life office at 4:30, a full hour in advance. I was a little concerned when my place in line was on the sidewalk between Liggett/Koening and SoFoHo, but even so, I knew there were not 1,500 people in front of me. At the very most, there were probably 700 people. While I stood there, I noticed some people cutting in line with their friends, but I tried to remain calm about it since I knew I would still get a ticket without an issue. As 4:30 turned into 5:00, I was told* (*shouted at) by a CS40 student representative to “sit down” in line, as this would prevent people from cutting in line, or at least make it more obvious that they were cutting. I convinced myself that this would actually prevent cutting in line and was not simply a CS40 representative on a power trip, so I sat down, like almost everyone around me. However, there were no CS40 representatives monitoring the queue where I was positioned (or anywhere, for that matter), so the cutting still happened. Believe it or not, sitting down did absolutely nothing. Shocking. People would just walk up to where their friends were sitting and—wait for it—sit down with them. What a concept. Even though I saw this happening with some regularity, I was not that concerned because I knew there still weren’t 1,500 hundred people in front of me. At 5:30, the line started moving, and I felt encouraged. Shortly after, however, I was given some absolutely outrageous news: each person in line could get up to 3 TICKETS, as long as they provided 3 student IDs. What? Was I possibly hearing that correctly? Let me get this straight: So the CS40 people had made a somewhat noble effort to prevent line-cutting—and to support the people who waited for over an hour—by telling them to sit down, yet they then institute a policy which LITERALLY LET EACH STUDENT HAVE 2 PEOPLE CUT THEM IN LINE. And the people who cut didn’t even have to wait there! That is INSANE! Later on, the 3-ticket policy was reduced to 2. To me, this was an admission by CS40 that the policy was totally wrong from the start. Why they didn’t just CHANGE IT BACK TO THE “1 TICKET PER PERSON” POLICY THAT WAS LAID OUT IN THE EMAIL is beyond my comprehension. At 6:15, I reached the Res. Life annex tunnel area. There were still at least 150 people in front of me when I heard the bad news: they were out of tickets. Disappointed, I went to speak to someone from Res. Life/CS40. All she said was to “check the WUStock facebook page,” and that they “did not anticipate” the level of interest. Her arrogance, along with the arrogance of the student representatives of CS40, was as enraging as the fact that I didn’t get a ticket. The poor planning and holier-than-thou attitude of CS40 and ResLife is an embarrassment to this university. And the fact that students were walking up to other students at the front of the line and paying them to take their ID and get them a ticket is not necessarily an indictment on them, but more on the event organizers for not realizing that as an inevitability. What’s more, people didn’t even get their names checked off any list and there were a lot of people who cut the line multiple times and got way more than 3 tickets. All in all, a terrible job by everyone involved. I pay to live in ResLife housing. WUStock is sponsored by CS40 and ResLife. I also pay the outrageous student activity fee of over $400 each year. There are students who live off campus who got tickets. They don’t pay for ResLife housing. There are also hundreds of non-Wash U students who will be in attendance as paid guests. They don’t pay for ResLife housing. They don’t pay the student activities fee. They don’t pay tuition. To quote a classic piece of American cinema, they “she doesn’t even go here.” In light of all of this, I will be looking to get some sort of refund from ResLife or this University, and I encourage everyone else who did not get a ticket to do the same. Hopefully, there will never be another total and complete fubar like this in the future, and hopefully the CS40/ResLife people will learn to get off of their collective high horse and try to actually do the right thing for the people in line who were just trying to do the right thing. For all those going to the concert, I genuinely hope you have a good time and hopefully some people can take and post video for those of us who won't be there."

Dear future freshmen of WashU: Since lots of you seem to be looking at this page anyways, here's some inside perspective- WashU has a gorgeous campus, amazing community of people, and such good food. Although it is a challenging school, you'll be thankful that it is. You will learn so much inside and outside the classroom. You'll discover who you are as a person and meet a whole new world of people. There is nothing and will never be anything like WashU and I am proud to say that I go to this school and I promise you, you will be too. I wouldn't trade my experiences for anything even though they haven't all been great. It's the bad experiences that let you truly enjoy the good experiences."

Hi, Wash U Confessions. This isn't a confession, but I wanted to tell you guys something. I've been seeing a lot of prospective students post on Wash U Confessions about the negative view of Wash U this page is giving them. A collection of anonymous posts is in no way an accurate collection of the student body's view of their university, and I feel like this site (while entertaining for those of us who go here already) could be giving outsiders the wrong idea and even causing them to change their future plans. I think it would be a lot better for everyone if this page could be made private to people who don't go to Wash U. Don't you think so?"

By no means do I condone the actions that were done on Tuesday night. However, this has been completely overdone by social media, making it a hate crime and defamation. This is absolutely ridiculous and exaggerated, the photo of the scavenger hunt can explain this clearly. In terms of discrimination and the problem on this campus, I recognize that it is the problem. However, when there is an all black table at the DUC, where if a white person sits down, they are immediately stared it, part of this segregation is done by them. If a person just wanted to have a conversation or meet some new people at this table, this would currently be considered ludicrous and looked down upon. This segregation is down by the people who believe they are currently being segregated. To say that no one knows what it is like to come from an underprivileged family is ridiculous. Once you are at Wash U, everybody has the exact same opportunity as the peers to get a world-class education. There are white people that are currently drowned in student debts because their family cannot pay for their education. Meanwhile, there are people in the Irving Scholars program who are getting the college partially paid for, not ever having to worry about paying this money back. Everybody has their own particular problems or hardship, some are more easier to see than others. However, to label the actions performed as a hate crime or defamation, as a result of the segregation or lack of opportunity on the Wash U campus, is completely false. The kids screwed up and they apologized. While this may not be enough, it is better than nothing. Don't be out for blood, we are all part of the same community."

I'm getting tired of the hypocrisy at Wash U. The school is so quick to try and right potential racial segregation when it might bring negative press to Wash U, but fully supports the self-imposed segregated groups that are perpetuating racial separation. We sit, hang out, and eat with our friends and, for the most part, we made our friends in the student groups/extracurriculars we joined. By continuing to have segregated student groups, people who would have otherwise become friends because of common interests don't because of different ethnicities, while at the same time a community comprised of small groups of the same ethnicity/gender is created. There was a time for these groups but that time has passed. We are all people and shouldn't separate ourselves by genetic distinctions--it doesn't matter whether you're black, gay, Korean, a woman, etc. when you share a common passion-- so why do we have all these student groups that celebrate these unimportant distinctions? Why must we have an Asian Pacific American Law Students Association, Black Law Students Association, Chinese American Law Students Association, Christian Legal Society, International Law Society, Jewish Law Students Association, Korean Law Students Association, Latino Law Students Association, Minority Law Students Association, and Native American Law Students Association? Why not just a Law Students Association? Really, this self-imposed segregation is just hurting the community as a whole and is an outdated societal construct. How about Wash U stops apologizing for the product of whatever discriminatory problem exists here, and takes action to fix the core of it?"

I go to every different campus eatery I pass on my way back from campus everyday and get something. I figure if I get just one or two things from each place, no one will notice how much I eat and judge me for it. Only when I'm back in my room surrounded by all my trash and the malingering smells of pizza, caesar dressing, stir-fry, ramen noodles and ice cream do I regret my choices. I somehow manage to forget that feeling while I'm in my post-gorging food coma and I do it again the next day."
3550,2013-02-28 00:07:29,"sion #280

My experience thus far at Wash U has been one of struggle. I can't tell if there is a real subset of individuals that judge me and others, who are doing cooler things, going out more, having more fun, or if such a community is imagined. Real or not, I feel as if I'm left out. I'm theorizing from the margins. I go to school here, where there is so much opportunity, and I am so thankful everyday for my education and a fighting chance at a good future, but I can't help but feel like there's nothing ""for me"" here. I want you to understand this cognitive dissonance: how can I have so much and yet so little? I yearn for a different kind of community, the one I thought Wash U actually was, but am not confident I'd find one by transferring. So I've been reflecting and I've reached one conclusion: Everyone just wants to be accepted. From the actions of the SAE pledges, to the girl ""studying"" in the library on the second floor. They just want to be cool, be noticed, be a part of a group. But I feel like we're all doing it in the wrong way. We put up fronts, we only choose to hang out with a set ""elite"", we put others down to feel fulfilled ourselves. Or, we are quiet, we are the ones who are constantly studying and stressed, don't have time for social activity, we feel left out, that something is wrong with us, that it is an individual problem and not a larger social issue. I think that's wrong. Like any other place on the face of the planet, Wash U has problems. I mean, heck, look at the tension caused between Greeks and GDIs on this page, alone. But that's not my point... my point is we—YOU—have the power to change. We've all taken the tests, gotten the grades to enter. We are all intelligent beings. I believe that each and every single student here is capable of more than they know, including capable of changing the social structure of the Wash U community. That's right. You, as an individual have the power to smile to a stranger, to strike up conversation with an old friend from freshman year, to let someone know that no matter what they're going through, no matter how hard things are, you will be there for them. Wash U is a hard place. I said it: it's fucking hard! And it has a tendency to get the best of us. My self included. But at the end of the day, it's the little things that really do mean so much. Let's get back to that. I've been dying to know: Students of Wash U, are you with me?"

This is a tribute to the nice guys. The nice guys that finish last, that never become more than friends, that endure hours of whining and bitching about what assholes guys are, while disproving the very point. This is dedicated to those guys who always provide a shoulder to lean on but restrain themselves to tentative hugs, those guys who hold open doors and give reassuring pats on the back and sit patiently outside the changing room at department stores. This is in honor of the guys that obligingly reiterate how cute/beautiful/smart/funny/sexy their female friends are at the appropriate moment, because they know most girls need that litany of support. This is in honor of the guys with open minds, with laid-back attitudes, with honest concern. This is in honor of the guys who respect a girl’s every facet, from her privacy to her theology to her clothing style. This is for the guys who escort their drunk, bewildered female friends back from parties and never take advantage once they’re at her door, for the guys who accompany girls to bars as buffers against the rest of the creepy male population, for the guys who know a girl is fishing for compliments but give them out anyway, for the guys who always play by the rules in a game where the rules favor cheaters, for the guys who are accredited as boyfriend material but somehow don’t end up being boyfriends, for all the nice guys who are overlooked, underestimated, and unappreciated, for all the nice guys who are manipulated, misled, and unjustly abandoned, this is for you. This is for that time she left 40 urgent messages on your cell phone, and when you called her back, she spent three hours painstakingly dissecting two sentences her boyfriend said to her over dinner. And even though you thought her boyfriend was a chump and a jerk, you assured her that it was all ok and she shouldn’t worry about it. This is for that time she interrupted the best killing spree you’d ever orchestrated in Halo to rant about a rumor that romantically linked her and the guy she thinks is the most repulsive person in the world. And even though you thought it was immature and you had nothing against the guy, you paused the game for two hours and helped her concoct a counter-rumor to spread around the floor. This is also for that time she didn’t have a date, so after numerous vows that there was nothing “serious” between the two of you, she dragged you to a party where you knew nobody, the beer was awful, and she flirted shamelessly with you, justifying each fit of reckless teasing by announcing to everyone: “oh, but we’re just friends!” And even though you were invited purely as a symbolic warm body for her ego, you went anyways. Because you’re nice like that. The nice guys don’t often get credit where credit is due. And perhaps more disturbing, the nice guys don’t seem to get laid as often as they should. And I wish I could logically explain this trend, but I can’t. From what I have observed on campus and what I have learned from talking to friends at other schools and in the workplace, the only conclusion I can form is that many girls are just illogical, manipulative bitches. Many of them claim they just want to date a nice guy, but when presented with such a specimen, they say irrational, confusing things such as “oh, he’s too nice to date” or “he would be a good boyfriend but he’s not for me” or “he already puts up with so much from me, I couldn’t possibly ask him out!” or the most frustrating of all: “no, it would ruin our friendship.” Yet, they continue to lament the lack of datable men in the world, and they expect their too-nice-to-date male friends to sympathize and apologize for the men that are jerks. Sorry, guys, girls like that are beyond my ability to fathom. I can’t figure out why the connection breaks down between what they say (I want a nice guy!) and what they do (I’m going to sleep with this complete ass now!). But one thing I can do, is say that the nice-guy-finishes-last phenomenon doesn’t last forever. There are definitely many girls who grow out of that train of thought and realize they should be dating the nice guys, not taking them for granted. The tricky part is finding those girls, and even trickier, finding the ones that are single. So, until those girls are found, I propose a toast to all the nice guys. You know who you are, and I know you’re sick of hearing yourself described as ubiquitously nice. But the truth of the matter is, the world needs your patience in the department store, your holding open of doors, your party escorting services, your propensity to be a sucker for a pretty smile. For all the crazy, inane, absurd things you tolerate, for all the situations where you are the faceless, nameless hero, my accolades, my acknowledgement, and my gratitude go out to you. You do have credibility in this society, and your well deserved vindication is coming."

I'm white. People tell me I'm entitled to all kinds of things and that I've always had it easy and it makes me feel awful. I grew up in a single family household with an often unemployed parent. The other is an alcoholic that I haven't seen since I was 10. My family didn't go on vacations, I've never had my own car, gifts on my birthday or at graduation are small, and I've been working since I was 14. I am in the lowest decile in terms of household income on campus, and I'm graduating with more debt than I know how to manage. All of my friends--white, black, minority, single-parented or otherwise--seem a whole lot better off than I am, but I'm too embarrassed to say how much it bothers me when they complain about not getting their parents to refill their campus card or going on a ""bad"" vacation to the Caribbean instead of Europe or buy them new clothes. I have never felt privileged or entitled to anything because of my skin color. Instead, I often feel compelled to lie because of what people have already assumed about my background. Getting an acceptance letter from WU was the luckiest day of my life. I don't know if being here is the financially responsible think to do, but I have never in my life been happier than when I am on this campus. I hate leaving and I always come back early. Skin color alone does not indicate the personal backstory of someone on this campus, but too many of you, no matter your skin color, jump to conclusions too fast. I know how conscientious and empathetic we can really be and I wish that would show through more, especially in times like these."

What the brothers of SAE participated in is a hate crime: A hate crime is a category used to describe bias-motivated violence: ""assault, injury, and murder on the basis of certain personal characteristics: different appearance, different color, different nationality, different language, different religion."" ""Hate crime"" generally refers to criminal acts that are seen to have been motivated by bias against one or more of the types above, or of their derivatives. Incidents may involve physical assault, damage to property, bullying, harassment, verbal abuse or insults, or offensive graffiti or letters (hate mail). I am truly appalled that this happened on WashUs campus, but if they felt it okay to verbally attack people publicly, I'm truly concerned about the basis of their"" brotherhood"" behind closed doors. Legal action should be taken, and I'm not sorry about what happens to their organization, as I am beyond disgusted and offended. My confession: I don't feel comfortable/safe on this campus anymore."

Senior checking in. If WashU was good for something, it really helped me grow the hell up. I came in as a freshman expecting the world to be offered to me on a silver platter - grades, girls, partying, job prospects, everything. I expected to be coddled throughout my 4 years and come away with a badass degree after 4 fantastic years from a badass school. Year by year, nay, month by month you realize that you decide your path and work to build it. Yeah, my GPA tanked (probably more so than if I had gone to my state school), but I'm better for it going forward. I know how to work, when to work, and when to turn that switch off and do other things. You know what? So do the vast majority of your peers, and I'm glad that I got exposed to the level of competition (friendly or not) here because the real world doesn't provide office hours or TA help sessions. It's all on you. Welcome to the rest of your life. So, thanks WashU for helping me at least mature. Even though this page may be littered with pretty stupid things from presumably immature people, they'll all learn in due time, if not at WashU then wherever they end up next. tl;dr WashU: Where the only thing that goes down on you is your GPA. Lol ya lazy."

I actually love WashU. I also love St. Louis. I'm happier here than I've been in years and although the city isn't exactly regarded as the gem of American society, I appreciate the opportunity it gives me to make a real impact in the community here and really help people. I'm from a pretty nice town and got into my fair share of pretty good schools, but I'm so happy with my decision to come here instead. I love the people, the professors, and I even think administration here does a pretty good job of taking care of us. I mean hell, our dining hall is open until 3am and we have TempurPedic mattresses, amazing people whose job it is to basically be friends to the freshmen, and pretty much any academic opportunity and resource we could reasonably want. So to anybody else out there who feels like they're the only one who loves WashU (and I hope to God you ARE out there)... you're not."

So I'm taking my daily ""fuck chemistry, my head hurts and I don't get this anyway so I'm taking a break"" procrastination shit during class, and as usual I bust out my phone (remember when we didn't have smartphones when we pooped? life was the worst.) Well anyway I'm absolutely destroying my loser friend in this racing game. Beat him like 25 games in a row, at least (I was in the bathroom awhile, you can blame last night's taco bell run for that lol.) So by this point I'm getting pretty bored of this game and go to tweet at my lame ass friends in class about how wash u screws us pre-meds over and i'm just gonna go join the b-school because like who really wants to get up for class on friday anyway?? but all of a sudden I see I have a snap chat and of course I'm thinking pleasebeboobspleasebeboobspleasebeboobs (but just kidding cuz this is wash u and fun things like that never happen) but then I see its from my loser friend whose ass I was just kicking. I open it up and he's trying to be all badass by flipping me off and I'm all like, dude you're a sore loser. Then I get this HILARIOUS idea that I'm gonna snap chat him my poop. Unfortunately, Wash U makes this pretty difficult with the whole autosensor flushers (glad to know my tuition isn't being wasted on such completely unnecessary things!) So i'm messing around for awhile, trying to get the right angle so that i'm blocking the sensor but still getting the poop with enough lighting, when all of a sudden I hear someone slam the stall door next to me shut. Well this catches me completely off guard because I didn't know anyone was in the bathroom and I've been making a lot of weird grunting noises trying to get in position for this legendary snap chat and in my nervous reaction I drop my phone right down between my spread out legs. Talk about a shitty phone... needless to say, #FUCKYOUTACOBELLSHITS"

I was SOOOO angry.  I couldn't think straight. I ran into the bathroom, into the shower, grabbed her shampoo bottle, and went into the bathroom.  There I proceeded to diarrhea into the bottle a little bit, capped it, and returned it to the shower.  The days following were hilarious...my roommate would come out of the shower with her hair smelling like shit! (Shows her!)  Pretty soon the guy that I had a crush on got rid of her, and came back to me.  Now, whenever I get double crossed by a so-called friend, I pull the same maneuver I did that night freshman year.  My friends and I now call it the shampoopoo revenge, LOL!"

I'm terrified I'm not making the right choice for my future. I hear about all of these majors that are supposed to pay well after college and I pretend not to care, but I don't even know if my choice is going to stay my passion forever or if I'm even smart enough to do well at it."

I scrutinize the hell out of WashU with regards to how my tuition money being spent. It pisses me off to no end when I see petunia beds being planted outside when I'm getting shitty-ass internet in the library. I was also in the oh-hell-to-the-no camp with Bristol Palin debacle a few years back. Yet, I have no problems with WashU using my tuition money to bring a couple of porn stars to campus for sex week. None. Zero. Considering that I'm female, I wonder what this says about me."

During this one final exam, I needed to use the bathroom (I had pulled an overnighter followed by 2 cups of coffee) but was stopped by the TAs because apparently there had been a huge cheating scandal during last exam. I told the TAs that one of them(boy or a girl, it really didn't matter at the time) could follow me to the bathroom and choose a stall him/herself. To cut to the chase, I had to leave the exam room 30min early cuz my bladder was gonna burst. Somebody remind me, since when did WashU earn the right to stop us from using the fucking toilet?"

My friends and I secretly pee on/around campus. We keep track of everywhere we've peed and get excited when we pee in especially risky locations. No shame, it's really the most convenient option."
