Broadly speaking, I'm very, very happy (and thankful for it).

But I confess that the looming specter of senescence nauseates me. I have this vivid (cf. accurate) memory of my middle school health teacher—himself unmistakably past his prime—drawing a fairly crude, blue spiral on the whiteboard.

He places the marker on the board. "This is your capacity when you're born." (Though I'm certain he never said it in so many words, I always remember it with such bluntness.) He begins a slow outward spiral. "And this is your capacity as you reach your teens... your 20s...". He continues outward until he hits some nonspecific middle age. Then he starts spiraling back inward toward the center again.

If I enjoyed studying biology more, I'd be gunning for a shot at Calico or the like. Instead, I implore our bio students to consider searching for inroads toward beating the shit out of that looming specter. That would be pretty cool.
