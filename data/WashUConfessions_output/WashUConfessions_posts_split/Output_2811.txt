Asian female.
Never dated - not even close. People I met in class and student groups won't even look at me outside of necessity. I'm for sure not to be classified as "hot" but I'm definitely not overweight.
No friends, only acquaintances. Last year I was having trouble moving my suitcases down 4th floor in a traditional dorm. I looked through my phone book twice and could find no one to help.
My last post to here generated more likes than that of all my posts on my own page for the past year added up. Like literally no one cares about me.
Got rejected in every single student group/position application here at Wash U that involves any competition.
I don't drink or party but I'm not going to blame the environment. I know people here who never drink or party and have friends and boyfriend.
Something must be wrong with me but I don't know what.
I do want a relationship and friendship and I am serious on that. I don't know what mess my interpersonal skills up as well as what messes my interview skills up.
Now that I'm a senior I couldn't even find people to go on senior class trip with me.
I'm a total failure.
Plus I just made it pass honors requirement and I promise I'm not the "study is the only important thing in my life" kind. I want to have fun - maybe not the wild type of fun - but fun.
