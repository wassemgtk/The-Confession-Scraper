Hello to all my classmates at Wash U,

I am an African American man who has an issue with many African American members of our campus. I grew up in a privileged area with mostly wealthy people, who happen to be white. Just because I don't walk around using slang, don't go to the meetings on Friday, and don't sit at the 'black' tables does not mean I'm not black.

Why is the color of my skin suppose to determine how I act? Isn't that exactly what you are all fighting against? I'm a product of my environment and so are you. Don't try to ostracize me because I don't act how you think I should. I am me and you are you. Deal with it.
