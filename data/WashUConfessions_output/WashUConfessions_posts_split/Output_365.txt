I don't have anything against greek life or the people in it, it just seems lame.  In my opinion, there seems to be cooler things to do outside of the boring repetitiveness that greek life offers.  The one thing I think greek life does offer is convenience, convenience with test sharing, getting rides, having people to hang out with if you haven't made your own plans, people to pass down housing to you, (and even making friends), which is certainly nothing to scoff at.  However, outside of this admittedly very helpful convenience, greek life doesn't seem to have a lot going for it.
