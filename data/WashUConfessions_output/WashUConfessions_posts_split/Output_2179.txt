I confess that when I saw someone write that Che Guevara was a "hero" on a poster, it made me very upset.  My stepmothers family endured brutal persecution at the hands of Guevara's murder squads.
He even attempted genocide against gays. Attention students:  I know you mean well, but please stop defending genocide and stop wearing those damn Che Guavara shirts.  You have no idea what you're advocating.
