One of the homeless guys on the loop stopped me while I was walking home alone at like midnight on a weekday and asked me to buy him food. All I had was my campus card so I told him they would have to take bear bucks. He asked me to buy him like $18 worth of good from Blueberry Hill but they weren't doing take out bc it was too late, and when I told him that he asked me to walk two blacks back to Jimmy Johns and I said I didn't know if they take bear bucks and he stormed off cussing me out. Asshole can fuck off and get a job maybe?
