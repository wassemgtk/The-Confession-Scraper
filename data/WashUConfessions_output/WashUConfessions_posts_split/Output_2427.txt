As an LGBTQ student, I feel so disrespected and excluded on this campus. Going to Pride Alliance actually makes me feel worse about myself. All I wanted was a community of people who feel the same way I do, but what I found was a cliquey competition for who's got it worse and who's the quirkiest. I just want friends who understand what I go through and feel. Even outside of Pride, the rest of campus feels so heterocentric, and I get intimidated by the lack of LGBTQ visibility in classes and around campus. Can someone help without being counterproductive?
