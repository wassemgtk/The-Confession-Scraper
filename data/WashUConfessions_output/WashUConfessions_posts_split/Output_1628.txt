Recently, I had an assignment and after finishing presenting it to our teacher in class, my teacher just didn't support our vision for the project and voiced that in a way that seemed harsh and offended me a little. I felt extremely embarrassed, as I would have in any class. But in this class, I am the only Black student. I became very anxious of what my white classmates thought of me. I felt belittled. I thought, "I'm already excluded enough in this classroom, let alone this university, why single me out even more?" I felt like it was an attack. Usually, I wouldn't have taken the feedback so personally but because of the atmosphere I felt like I was under heavy pressure. After class, I even went to BD. While I talked to one of the workers there (black female), I felt somewhat comfortable again but as soon as I walked through the rest of the dining hall and out of the door, I felt like I was suffocating again. I was suddenly aware of how few Blacks there are on this campus and wondered if everyone in the dining hall was judging me for my embarrassing failure (not even a failure, though) in class. I thought I would cry that entire time and I was willing myself not to until I got outside and put my hood on. But the second I got outside, I finally felt free. There was no one outside really and I was just me. Not a black student in a sea of white students.

I guess the point of me sharing this story is just to show that the lack of diversity here affects some minority students more than just by making them feel lonely. When you have anxiety, the lack of representation only adds to it. It makes it hard to be successful when you constantly feel like you need to prove yourself to people you don't even know just because there are less people who look like you. I'm not even sure if I described the feeling well enough because I have never felt so inadequate in my life. I don't think I could ever depict it in a way that would do it justice so I'll just stop here.
