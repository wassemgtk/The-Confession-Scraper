I confess that I'm actually considering hurting myself so that I can see a counselor at SHS, because apparently that's the criteria for getting an appointment. I started speaking with the coordinator in early February and finally have an appointment for the very end of March. How does Wash U think this is okay? Why does harm have to be self-inflicted for it to be legitimate?
