I used to be like a lot of people here. Freshman year first semester was really hard on me. I had no friends, no motivation, and the rigors of premed had absolutely beaten me to the ground. I had no one to talk to, and I am not the type of person who shares my feelings, so no one really knew what was up.

Now I am a junior, and my life has completely changed. I am still premed, absolutely loving my classes, and joined a fraternity and have friends everywhere on campus.

I'd like to give you guys the same advice that helped me. Don't waste time with self pity. It will only bury you further into the ground. the first step is to accept the situation. accept that right now, things may be shitty. they may not be in the future, but right now thats how things are. Once you accept things, then just set little goals to change things. dont make them big and vague, but small concrete things. I started with say hi to 10 people today. just do something out of your comfort zone. Staying in my comfort zone had only led to self pity, so there wasnt really anything "comfortable" about it. Move up and start challenging yourself more.

Looking back I can say this stuff wasnt a big deal, but it seemed like it at that time. Risk things! If you have no friends, starting a conversation can only increase the number from zero.

if studies suck, there are some options. To those premeds, ill say that if you really are interested, hang on! the intro classes are bullshit and i got mostly Bs on them, but now I am getting As on my advanced level courses. the reqs are just hell.

for others in different lines, i offer similar advice. remember that the first couple classes are weed outs, so they are testing to see if you really want to pick up a line. If you have the enthusiasm, then hang in there! If you find you are really lacking enthusiasm, start fulfilling distribution requirements. this will let you diversify your classes and hopefully figure out what you want to major in.

Final Advice- fuck everyone, do what you need to to find your passion. If there is a club you want to make, go make it! it is actually not difficult. The only REAL thing stopping you from happiness is you. if someone else is, then fuck em
