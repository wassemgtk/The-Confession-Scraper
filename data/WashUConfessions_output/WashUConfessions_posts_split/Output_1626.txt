I hate the green cup. Every year, comments about how you're fat if you take the elevator or the circ or pretty much anything that's not "green" get made. Posters near the elevators and stairs always get defaced with some kind of anti fat comment. The one in my dorm was changed from "Take the stairs if you care" to "Take the stairs if you fat", and for some reason, my roommate felt the reason to not only point this change out to me but to also say "I love it." It's in plain view for everyone to see, and has been for most of the week; RAs take down inappropriate drawings, but no one has done anything about comments like this.

Last year during the green cup, I regularly broke down crying in my room because one person always made a point to tell me that I should take the stairs, and it got to the point that it became obvious that they were giving me passive-aggressive "advice" to improve my health.

Yik Yak regularly has anti-fat posts that are both objectifying and demeaning.

I regularly see and hear people literally rejoicing in the fact that there are barely any fat people on this campus.

I am fat. I admit it. I'm also working on it, for my own personal reasons. But the fact is that I feel like I don't belong here and my existence is being ridiculed expressly because I exist. My business is my own, and I shouldn't feel the need to justify my choices, actions, or existence.
