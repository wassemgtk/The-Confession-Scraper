I confess that I am questioning something that has been a very important part of my life here at WashU. I've been a member of the Compliments club for 4 semesters now, and I've been out there every Friday that I could be. I love seeing people smile when they get complimented, or laugh at us when we say something stupid, and I truly believe that we brighten up peoples days. In the two-ish years that I've been doing this we've never received anything but positive feedback. People have come up to us and told us how much they appreciated it, tour guides make a point of telling their tours about us, and so on.

This Friday however, a girl came up to us and told us that what we were doing was verbal harassment, and that we were actually scaring a lot of people. I was surprised, and a little upset, because no one had ever expressed that view before, but when I thought more about it it made sense that no one ever had. Someone who was intimidated or scared of our group was probably pretty unlikely to engage us, or tell us how we made them feel. I, and I'm sure I speak for everyone else on Compliments, would feel awful if this was an opinion held by a majority of students, or even just a few. We do what we do with the express purpose of cheering people up and making them smile, and the idea that we are doing the exact opposite of that is really troubling.

So however you feel about Compliments, please let us know. Comment on this post, come and talk to us (we're usually by the underpass midday Friday) or find one of us as we're leaving if you don't want to talk to the whole group. we won't get offended or hurt by whatever you have to say, we just genuinely want to understand what everyone's opinion on us is. Like I said earlier, all we are trying to do is cheer people up on a Friday, and if that isn't what we're actually doing please let us know.
