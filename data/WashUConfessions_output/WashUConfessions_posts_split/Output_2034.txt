I confess I hold a very popular opinion: I am black and I do not support the Ferguson movement. As more and more evidence is released it really is starting to look like Darren Wilson was acting in self defense. I know we'll never know exactly what happened, but if the grand jury decides not to charge Wilson with a crime I don't believe it's because of racism or a system of oppression, but because they have carefully considered the evidence and have made the best decision they could. No doubt the jury knows the enormous consequences of their decision and are trying to do the best they can.

Don't get me wrong: it's not that I don't sympathize with Michael Brown's family or the people of Ferguson. I feel terrible for his family: no parents should have to go through what they have. And it's not that I don't believe things need to change because clearly they do. I just don't think Wilson shooting Brown is indicative of systematic racism. I've seen some of these issues firsthand (I grew up in an area that, although not as bad as Ferguson, wasn't all that nice either) and I think the bigger problems are the poverty, broken homes, and poor education systems that contribute to the crime rate in neighborhoods like Ferguson. I don't hate the cops for trying the best they can in really crappy circumstances.

I think it's a shame that this whole situation probably won't result in any meaningful change. I mean, yeah they might institute some better training programs for the police officers or increase the percentage of black officers or something, but at the end of the day those underlying problems will still be there. And even though most of the protesters will be peaceful, some people are still going to use this as an excuse to attack cops or loot stores (which, ironically, are usually the businesses of the people they say they are helping.)

I guess that I'm trying to say is: Ferguson needs change, but this is not the way and Michael Brown should not be their martyr. I just don't feel like I can express this opinion anywhere else.
