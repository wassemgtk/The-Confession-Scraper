As a chem lab TA, I've seen students read the buret markings upside down, wipe the wrong sides of the cuvette, and still use tap water instead of de-ionized water. No matter how "book smart" you are, your unknown accuracy and lab behavior points will reflect how you can't follow simple directions and don't understand what you're doing. I'm not trying to make fun of anyone, I'm just worried for all these "future doctors." Show some maturity by taking time to prepare, and please ask questions if you're confused. Who knows, you might actually learn something practical.
