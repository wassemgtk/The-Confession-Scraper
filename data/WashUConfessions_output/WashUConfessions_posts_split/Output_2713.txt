I confess that I am truly pissed and disappointed at the Senior Class Council and the SPB at this years choice for Senior Class Trip and W.I.L.D. Kansas City? Why not go to Branson, or someplace equally as shitty? Why not Chicago. Hell why not Nashville or Memphis? The trip to Kansas City has only put a downer on something I've been looking forward to since freshman year. WTF.

Also, why Icona Pop? Who asked for them? Like honestly? Why not Ludacris? Too many rappers in a row? He's too old? He was one of the biggest artists of the 00s for Pete's sake! I confess that I'm annoyed and I wish we had better leadership.
