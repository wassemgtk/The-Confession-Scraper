Before coming to WashU, I was indifferent to Christians. In my first few days at WashU, I bumped into a number of Christians who kept inviting me to churches and whatnot. I didn't grow up in an especially liberal city, but my hometown's essentially indifferent to religion. Naturally, I declined their invitations to tag along to church services. I'm an atheist and I told them so.
Big mistake.
Some even told me I was going to hell, that I was doing something sinful and prayed for my salvation alongside a bunch of other bullshit that I don't even believe in. Others chastised me for saying, "Oh my God..." or "Jesus Christ!" in public. Keep in mind this was all within a few days of arriving on campus, when I was still adjusting to living away from home and wondering if I made right decision with my major selection. The added stress did not help. The lone atheist group was dead back then, and maybe I could've spoken to my RA about it-- but hey, he's an active member at the Catholic Students Center.
I've graduated now and have moved elsewhere that's more tolerant of diverse faiths. But hey, the damage's done. Now whenever I see someone who has a cross necklace or meet a person who attends church regularly, I pretty much write them off permanently without getting to know them. At times, I'm tempted to just harass them on their beliefs just to spite them and make them feel as uncomfortable as I had felt during my four years at WashU. I don't. Why? Because my-lack-of-belief in God has obviously told me what your bible study failed to tell you, dear, narrow-minded 'Christian': treat others the way you want to be treated.
