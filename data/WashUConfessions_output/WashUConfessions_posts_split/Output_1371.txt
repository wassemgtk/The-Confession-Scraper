Since we're talking about premeds... I just wanted to say that I am a science major with a 4.0 science GPA who is not pre-med. I'm just sitting there, taking your spot in the curve, and my grades after undergrad don't matter nearly as much. But I actually care about the stuff I'm learning instead of just considering it a minor obstacle in the way of being a doctor, so there's that too.

I am a science major, but not pre-med. I have a 4.0 science GPA (yes, I'm ruining your curve. My grades don't matter nearly as much as pre-meds' do after graduation, but I am still spiteful just because there are so many people who don't give a shit about science not caring about what we learn.
