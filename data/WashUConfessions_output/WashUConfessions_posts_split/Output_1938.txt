I never had braces in middle or high school since my parents couldn't afford them.When I was home for Thanksgiving I went to my dentist who said I needed them so I went to the orthodontist. He agreed and said I should get them over Christmas vacation. My dad will now pay for them but I really don't know. I'm a freshman and am afraid they will hurt and no guy will want to date me and people will make fun of me. I know that's stupid and my roommate (she's the best) said I'm being stupid. What do you guys think?  I would get the regular kind. Invisilign won't work and I'll need four teeth pulled and spacers for a week and have to wear them for 2 years.  I didnt want think about it until after exams but I'm thinking about it all the time now.
