My GPA for the fall semester was awful. I am going to be put on academic probation for sure, and there is no way that I will be able to pledge in the spring.

My initial response was to act like I didn't care. Of course this didn't fare well with my parents, who had been hopeful all semester long. Conflict arose from my failure to understand why they couldn't be satisfied with my excuse of, "Oh, it's normal to have a bad first semester," which might be true, but what does that matter? Those C's on my transcript weren't going anywhere...

Slowly, I realized my own disappointment and regret. "Maybe I'm not cut out for this," I wondered, "Maybe I don't actually belong here..." I contemplated withdrawing from WashU, perhaps throwing away any chance of obtaining my dream job in the future. Confidence in my ability to succeed in anything seemed to dwindle.

Further introspection made me cut the BS. I recognized my failure to own up to the fact that this is MY education and MY future on the line; I am solely responsible for those marks on my transcript, regardless of all those problems that happened during the first month of the semester. Sure, I wasn't ready for the sheer workload that is college, but again, who's to blame for that?

This awareness brought me to the conclusion that it will take some planning to make sure I prevent this kind of dissatisfactory performance from ever happening again. Pinpointing each and every flaw in my studying habits culminated in a step-by-step method, customizable for any and every class, that is sure to guarantee my future academic success. Moreover, I've begun to work at my issues with being too prideful and determined the importance of forming a relationship with my professors; if I fall behind, it's always a good idea to contact them immediately instead of combatting unnecessary stress and wasting away in half-hearted review.

In the end, I realized that even though I started on the wrong foot with my college education, it is okay, really. I've learned from my mistakes and constructed a comprehensive plan for how to study next semester and, with the help of my friends and family to keep me accountable, I am now truly confident that I can bring my GPA up to par.

The point of this confession was to offer myself as an example for those who suffered a bad semester and are lost in terms of what they should do going forward, fellow freshmen in particular. Save for a few outliers that suffered truly unique circumstances to result in poor academic performance, I'm sure many of you can relate to -- what can simply be described as -- my study habits associated with laziness and reluctance to take my classes seriously.

Say what you will, but I am a firm believer of the notion that we were given a truly wonderful opportunity in our entrance to college; an opportunity by which one can only unlock its full potential with exceptional performance in academia, in addition to its many other beneficial aspects (aka I'm still going to party on the weekends).

I hope that even one of you that read through this wall of text will be inspired and find a real motivation to learn and succeed.

Happy holidays everybody, and a happy New Year! :)
