Whenever I get emails from wash u telling me to be an "ambassador," I'm tempted to do it and tell as many people as possible NOT to go to wash u. Partly because it would be fun and partly because I truly dislike (I wouldn't say hate) this school and deeply regret coming here, it was one of the biggest mistakes I've made in my life. Sadly it's too late to transfer.
