I shouldn't base my self-worth on my academic performance, but that's the way I've been raised: be the best student out there and anything even average is not good enough.
Now at WashU, I struggle just to keep a smile on my face because the rigor and my massive perfectionist complex have beaten me down, semester after semester.
I don't want to feel inferior any more.
