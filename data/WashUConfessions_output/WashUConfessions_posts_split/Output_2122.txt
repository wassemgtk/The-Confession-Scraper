I confess that I was raised Catholic, and attended Catholic school for 12 years, but no longer believe in God or identify as a Catholic. However, I went to Mass a few weeks ago, and though I thought most of it was bullshit, it all felt like home to me--the songs, the prayers, the actions. I know many former Catholics have a falling out with the Church and hate returning to Mass, but I almost enjoyed it. It was like catching up with an old friend who I don't want to remain friends with but it was still nice to see each other...if that makes any sense. I'd love to believe in God or a higher being that can drive my life forward and give me confidence that I won't just die and then disappear into oblivion, but I just haven't been able to do so. I just wish I could find a religion with all the love and caring that I found at Catholic school but with none of the God or Jesus stuff. I have such a high respect for people who are deeply religious and have such great faith, because I just can't find any kind of personal satisfaction in religion.
