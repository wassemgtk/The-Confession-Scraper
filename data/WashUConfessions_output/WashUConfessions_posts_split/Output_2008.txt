I'm currently sitting in BD watching the Social Justice Center crew (you know who y'all are) leaving their table absolutely covered in boxes, napkins, and trash. The reason I quit the Social Justice center is this: they come in, claim they care about events in the community (read: Ferguson), say that they are fighting to improve these communities, and yet they absolutely shit on the lovely staff here. Seriously, I can't stand that groups that claim to care so much about the events in Ferguson (I even recognized a few from the live broadcasts the night they released the decision) can't be bothered to care about the staff here, many of whom live and work in Ferguson and the surrounding neighborhoods. I stayed here over Thanksgiving break and opened up my dorms to two of the workers at BD because they were legitimately afraid about getting home safely, and that should mean more than sitting in a circle discussing high-minded rhetoric that won't change. Please guys, be honest with yourselves and don't make aggrandized claims about the difference you're making with your advocacy when the only real difference is the extra work added to what the janitoral staff do every night. They're people too and if you spent the night talking with them instead of bouncing ideas off of each other you might just learn a thing or two about the people that you want to represent.
