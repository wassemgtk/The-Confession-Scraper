I have kind of a problem with Wash U culture in that with such a culture of praising each other with pages like Wash U compliments and admirers and all that, and the feeling of needing to be involved in a cappella or high up on exec boards or whatever, some of those people not being praised or not finding groups that interest them may feel put down or left out. I don't think we treat each other as equals. I think we are striving for a culture of mutual admiration that is not yet quite so mutual.
