as a relatively recent wash u alum, i regret not taking my studies more seriously.  i coasted through college taking the easier classes/electives where possible and getting a decent gpa, instead of challenging myself and really pushing the limits of my brain.  i wouldn't trade the fun i had, but i wish i had taken my studies more seriously.  i'm doing a lot of independent studying on topics i'm interested in now, but i don't have as much time with a full-time job and various programs that i'm involved in.  i'm writing this in hopes that it will make anyone currently at wash u, or any university appreciate the 4 years you guys have to expand the potential of your brain.  Never again will you have complete freedom and resources to learn anything you want.

learn a new language.  take classes in different schools.  take business school classes if you're in the art school.  take a graphic design or computer science class.  most importantly, learn how to learn.  that's the skill that you get to spend 4 years developing with no distractions.  if you can properly learn to learn, you're better positioned for success than someone with an inflated gpa taking easy electives.  gpa only matters in college.  in the real word, you're measured by the value that you create.  that value increases exponentially if you know how to learn and continue doing so after college.
