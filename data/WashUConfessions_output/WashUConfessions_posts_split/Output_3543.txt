I'm getting tired of the hypocrisy at Wash U. The school is so quick to try and right potential racial segregation when it might bring negative press to Wash U, but fully supports the self-imposed segregated groups that are perpetuating racial separation. We sit, hang out, and eat with our friends and, for the most part, we made our friends in the student groups/extracurriculars we joined. By continuing to have segregated student groups, people who would have otherwise become friends because of common interests don't because of different ethnicities, while at the same time a community comprised of small groups of the same ethnicity/gender is created. There was a time for these groups but that time has passed. We are all people and shouldn't separate ourselves by genetic distinctions--it doesn't matter whether you're black, gay, Korean, a woman, etc. when you share a common passion-- so why do we have all these student groups that celebrate these unimportant distinctions? Why must we have an Asian Pacific American Law Students Association, Black Law Students Association, Chinese American Law Students Association, Christian Legal Society, International Law Society, Jewish Law Students Association, Korean Law Students Association, Latino Law Students Association, Minority Law Students Association, and Native American Law Students Association? Why not just a Law Students Association? Really, this self-imposed segregation is just hurting the community as a whole and is an outdated societal construct. How about Wash U stops apologizing for the product of whatever discriminatory problem exists here, and takes action to fix the core of it?
