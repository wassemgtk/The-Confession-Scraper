As a jacked individual, it upsets me how much I'm poked fun at for my choices. "Meathead" is just an offensive word as is "slut." Why is it okay for self-proclaimed college liberals to demand that we treat all groups with respect, but at the same time attempt to shame me for working hard on my body?
