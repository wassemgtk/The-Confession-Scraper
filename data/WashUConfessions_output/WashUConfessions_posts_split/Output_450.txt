I have a genuine question. Obviously it is not ok to judge someone as attractive or not based on their weight. Although some people do this, it is considered  socially unacceptable. However, I often hear  people (oftentimes girls) say things along the lines of, "I refuse to date someone who is shorter than me." Why is it socially acceptable to judge people based on something that they have literally no ability to change?
