I confess that I read into social situations way too much and it causes me a good amount of stress and worry whenever I feel left out of something. When I was younger, I had a severe social anxiety disorder I have since overcome, but I believe remnants of that anxiety still exists. I wish I could convince myself it was all in my head, but I have a suspicion there's something real to me feeling left out of situations too.

When I first came here, I had some trouble making friends. I've since made friends, but because most of them developed a bond with each other before I really came into the picture I don't feel like I'm as close with them. I have friends, but I don't think I have very many GOOD friends. Nobody ever texts me to get food. Nobody ever tells me about parties and social gatherings unless I ask them. I think they might even have a separate group message without me. I take ignored texts personally--I would rather be told no outright than left in the dark so I could at least do something about my situation.

I don't want this to become another "look at me, I'm sad about my life" soapbox confession, because that's not my point.

My point is, we're becoming adults. High school and middle school is over. Be nice to people. Treat them with respect. Don't belittle people. Stop leaving people in the dark--be blunt. Be honest and open about how you feel, even if it's negative. It feels shitty for anyone, but people currently suffering from/with a history of anxiety feel even worse. The truth hurts, but being stuck in limbo hurts even more. Face your issues head on and attack them.
