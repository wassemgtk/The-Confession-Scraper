I am so glad EST is a group on campus. They specialize is calling 911 and giving out Tylenol. Thank god they are around because no one knows the number to call 911 and of course no one has any Tylenol is their rooms. I am also thrilled that they got $30,000 of our money to buy themselves a new car so they can get to an emergency and call 911 quicker. Wash U will not see a dime of my money as long as EST is still a group on campus. I am going to be very rich and powerful so it's your loss Wash U
