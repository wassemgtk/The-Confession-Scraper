My parents always told me it's better to be polite than be rude, but when in conflict, people have misinterpreted that as being fake. Honestly, I don't know how to act any other way. I don't like to 'fight' and I don't enjoy 'drama' so I let things role off my back and smile, at the expense of having people think I am too awkward to address as sticky situation. Damn, I confess I have good intentions, but I wish they were seen as such.
