I'm a sophomore in artsci and not premed or in many math and science courses. I confess I feel like I'm missing out on the "real" WashU experience that unites everybody here. Your freshmen floor caters events for like 'the first gen chem exam' and calc exam and things like that that I wasnt a part of. People on here complain about the 'competitive atmosphere' at washu and the obsession over grades and I've never felt that. I want to be in the loop, but I'm somehow accidentally too far outside the mainstream of the washu experience to understand what everybody's talking about.
