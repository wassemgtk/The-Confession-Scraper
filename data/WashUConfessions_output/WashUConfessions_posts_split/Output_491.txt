Just a note to all of you out there like me, scrolling through your newsfeed and looking at all of your fb friends who are proudly coming out today or have been out for some time. You are not any less strong for not being out. You don't owe it to anybody else to come out. Your reasons for frolicking in Narnia or huddling with the coats are valid and I support you and your strength. I see you.
