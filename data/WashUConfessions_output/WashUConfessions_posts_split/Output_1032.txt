I am convinced that I  do better in classes with attractive teachers.  I mean, with professors like Wagoner (Physics) and Fenderson (AFAS), I found myself in the front row in every class, hanging off every word and definitely asking questions after class.  As a senior I leave this nugget of wisdom:  Fall in love/lust with at least one professor a semester, your GPA will say thank you!
