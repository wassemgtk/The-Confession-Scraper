I confess that the other night, I got hammered as a nail, then got nailed by a girl that I absolutely would have never slept with if she didn't start giving me a blow job while I was as drunk as ever and nearly passed out in my bed. I never thought I would be "raped" because even if both people are schwasted beyond proper decision making it seems like the guy is the one who is usually to blame.

      Anyways... I woke up the next morning, and I felt ashamed, a little annoyed at the girl and a little annoyed at my friends, but mostly just ashamed that I made the judgement call to get so drunk that I would do that. I want to say i got taken advantage of, but unless she slipped something in my drink, or had convinced me to drink more than I wanted, i can't see how I could just blame it on her. I don't want to sound insensitive towards people really beating themselves up over something like this, but in cases like this where no one was forced in any way to have sex, it feels like we the people who chose to get too drunk to make a proper decision are the ones to blame. Why should I report someone and try to get the school involved, when the obvious solution is to not to be so irresponsible with my drinking?

       Honestly, if Wash U is so concerned about date rape, maybe they should allow students to illegally use marijuana, rather than illegally drink... Shit, not only would we all be too busy watching cartoons or talking about the universe to "rape", but there'd be a whole lot less stomach pumping (There still may be some for the occasional over consumption of cereal), and with the money made from food services they could probably cut tuition by 10 percent.
