I confess that I'm having a lot of trouble fitting in at Wash U so a friend advised me to join one of the ethnic associations on campus. I had a very traditional upbringing unlike most Americans and I want to bond with other students that had that too. But my multicultural heritage stops me from fitting into any cultural stereotype.

I lived in South America with my mother but we were known as the "European Persians" living within that Latino community. I speak Spanish but I have nothing in common with any of my Latino peers (no offense). However I don't have an arabic or muslim last name either. My first name is portuguese and my last name is Hungarian, because of my father.  On top of that, I have much stronger Native American and Mongolian features than anyone else in my family. What one earth do I join? Would I be made fun of if I joined the MSA? Should I join Ashoka? Or simply the Latino Association, despite not really identifying with them even though I'm quote on quote "hispanic"? :/
