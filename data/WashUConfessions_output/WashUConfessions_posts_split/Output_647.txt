This may sound superficial as fuck, but one of the biggest regrets I have from college is not rushing. I'm a senior who's graduating this semester and even though I've had an amazing college experience, I think I would have truly benefited from joining a sorority. I had seriously considered it for a while, but decided not to for multiple reasons. I keep thinking about all the 'what ifs' and what my college experience would have been like had I rushed but I seriously need to stop thinking about it because it's a waste of time. So for all you underclassmen on the fence about sorority rush, I'd say give it a shot and if it's not for you then drop. Just live your life with no regrets.
