Since I didn't make RA it's likely that I will not be able to come back to WashU next year because my parents were barely able to scrape by this year, next year we will legitimately not have enough money to pay for this university and for my sister to attend school. Through this anonymous message board I am comfortable enough to admit that my mother is a layed-off teacher who can't find a job (no one is hiring, trust me she's applied to every teaching job available within 50 miles of where we live) and my father is a IT specialist who makes less than $50,000 a year supporting my family of 4. He worked hard his whole life and saved enough for me to go to a cheap public school, but thanks to my initial scholarship here my dream to reach higher became a reality. But with the cost going up next year (again) and my sister going off to college too, I will either need a miracle from the financial aid office or a winning lottery ticket. Preferably the second one.

Anyway, I asked my RCD why he thought I didn't make it and he says that it was likely due to the party I had been written up for in my suite. Funny thing is, that never happened. My roommates used my name as a scapegoat and never bothered telling me, and because it was an RA from a different floor who busted it up they had no idea that they were being lied to by my roommates. There's no appeals process for being an RA and I'm sure that if I didn't have to do work-study to keep up financially I could have been more involved in the social justice causes that I care about and that reflects well when applying to be an RA. The selection process apparently doesn't account for that. Overall, I'm well and truly fucked for next year.
