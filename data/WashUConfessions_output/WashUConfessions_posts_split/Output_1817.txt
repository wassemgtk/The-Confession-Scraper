I confess that the thing I was looking most forward to when coming to college was joining an a cappella group. I know that I am a really good singer but I am really shy and was always afraid that somebody would tell me that I am not as good as I think I am.

So every time I went to sign up for auditions, I chickened out. Now I am a second-semester senior, and not trying out is my biggest regret to date.
