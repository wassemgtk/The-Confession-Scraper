Current Senior now. When I first came to Wash U I was a relatively laid back guy, made a handful of friends, and did not have a hard time adjusting to the college lifestyle. Over the course of my time here, I've been bombarded with project after project, exam after exam and I started to notice my anxiety getting worse and worse. I've sought out help and gotten enough advice from counselors to fill a book, yet my anxiety holds strong and true. Now I just feel crippled by a constant sense of worry and planning for my future after college is even more crippling. I just don't know what to do anymore and I fear that once I leave this place, I'll have been so conditioned to working under extreme anxiety that I won't get better any time soon. Thanks Wash U.
