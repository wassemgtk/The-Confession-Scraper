Today I just found out that I have been denied to literally every social sorority on campus. Like most others that have posted here, I just wanted to find a group that would accept me and provide close friendship that I have lacked. So I am disappointed that I was not given this chance with any new group, but I feel like I now I have been given the opportunity to grow closer to my current friends.
