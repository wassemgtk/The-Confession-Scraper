Earlier in the semester, I think during early September at night, I was upset about something and ended up crying on the phone with my mother in that area behind Mallinckrodt,as it's usually empty by that time.  A tall, handsome guy walked by and asked if I was okay.  I tried to smile and say fine, but I think I was just so embarrassed that I may have come off as defensive.

It may seem silly, but I've felt horrible the past couple of months about possibly coming off as rude to one of those rare students who will stop and ask a stranger if they're doing okay.  So, if he sees this, I still really appreciate the gesture.  And I hope my reaction doesn't discourage him from being as kind to the next person.
