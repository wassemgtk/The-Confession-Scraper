I've gotta confess that since Freshman year started, I haven't been happy; the only time I'm happy is when I'm high or drunk. This whole living with a bunch of obnoxiously extroverted shitheads thing has got to me. Also, on a sidenote, when walking around, look up from your phone/the ground and watch what's in front of you/coming at you like a normal person.
