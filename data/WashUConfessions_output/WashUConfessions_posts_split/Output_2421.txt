As someone who is in a committed long distance relationship, I speak from genuine experience when I say that I am absolutely sick of being shamed for my choice. Anytime someone asks me about my personal life and my relationship is brought up, I almost always get responses ranging from slightly skeptical to flat out rude. I am tired of hearing people try to bet on "how long that will last." Yes, being in a long distance relationship is hard. It is not for everyone. But it is a personal choice between two people that does not merit condescending and negative comments and responses from people who don't even know our story. Being in such a relationship requires not only mutual support, commitment, and love between the two people, but also support and positivity from those around.
