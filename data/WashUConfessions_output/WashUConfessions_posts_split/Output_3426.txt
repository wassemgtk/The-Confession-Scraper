One of my friends was just waitlisted at WashU. He would be a great fit here, could absolutely keep up academically, and would contribute a lot to campus. So to all the people already here who don't go to class or put some effort into this (and I know you're out thereâ€” I think about half of you live on my floor), I hope that next time you hear your 10am alarm, you remember that there are a lot of kids out there who would love to have your bed.
