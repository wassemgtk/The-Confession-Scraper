So my parents just got a letter from the school that the tuition for the school is 47 grand per year. I get financial aid which cuts away a significant portion of the tuition, but this is just way too much. Even a small increase in the tuition is staggering to my family. My parents are the only ones working in the family and they're supporting for my grandparents as well. My younger brother gave up the opportunity to go to a school of his choice because of tuition, and I'm living on a meal per day. I'm applying to every scholarship I can find, every tutoring, and also every student job, but it's just hard to balance all this with my studies. I'm trying hard to find a way to make it work, but I really don't know how.
