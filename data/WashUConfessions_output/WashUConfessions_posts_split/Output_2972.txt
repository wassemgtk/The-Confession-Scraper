To the person who turned in a wallet at the bookstore today: thank you very much. You have no idea how much it meant to me. This semester has not been going so well for me, to put it mildly, both at school and at home. Today everything seemed to be crashing down on me, and losing my wallet was just the poisoned cherry on top. This random act of kindness may have been common decency to you; for me, it was so much more. I am not a macho guy, but I also don't cry often. I teared up when the cashier said my wallet had been turned in. I hope this stands as an example of just how much the little things can matter to someone, and I hope it encourages everyone at WashU to continue to foster the friendly, caring community that we all can enjoy. And if you are the one who turned in my wallet, please comment; I would like to thank you in person, and buy you dinner, if you would like.
