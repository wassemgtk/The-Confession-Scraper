I also saw confession 2469 in 3 AM, studying for my exam. I had such a hard time last week,tons of work in addition to having conflict with my friends. I tend to carry all my burdens by myself, because I do not want others to think I am weak. Yeah, I know it is funny and unhealthy, but I thought I have a high mental strength (if it even makes sense) and I could handle everything.

Turns out I cannot. I needed someone to rely on, and to tell what's going on recently. I saw confession 2469 and called my parents immediately.

As I am living away from them, I did not want them to worry about me and always told them I am doing well while I really was not.
But when I told them that I am having hard time and I do not know what to do, they told me they knew I am pretending I am okay, and I don't have to do that. They told me whenever I have hard time, just call them and talk about the problems. After an hour or so, I felt much better.

So talk to your parents. Talk to your friends. Talk to somebody.
It is extremely helpful.
