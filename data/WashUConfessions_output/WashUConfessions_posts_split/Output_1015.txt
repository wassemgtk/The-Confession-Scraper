I am absolutely and royally fucked. I went from a 3.4 to a 2.86 in 1 semester. My lifelong dreams of becoming a surgeon seem like they have slipped away. I'm starting to realize I really like studying economics and finance related topics, but don't know how to combine that with my compulsion to make a positive impact in the world. Nor do I know how to convey these things to my strictly STEM-field immigrant parents. I'm starting to feel my previous mental issues start flaring up again and I don't know how to stop it. What scares me the most? I might not be returning in the fall, and I really, truly love this school and its people.
