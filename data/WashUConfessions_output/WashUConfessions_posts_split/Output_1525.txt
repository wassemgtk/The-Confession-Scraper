I have strong feelings for someone who doesn't feel the same about me and I keep trying to convince myself that he'll come around and it'll work out, but I think I know deep down it isn't going to.  I'm not even sure why I'm doing this because he's often irresponsible and childish, isn't particularly interested in my life as far as I can tell, has compartmentalized me to an extent that we can't just sit and watch a movie together, and isn't really ever there for me if and when I need him though I am always there for him. He is also, however, incredibly kind, intelligent, curious, creative, and thoughtful, and we usually have so much fun together.

I know that it isn't a problem with either one of us.  It isn't my fault or his.  I don't feel like I need him and I don't think it's that I want him to change.  I just, for some reason, really want him there.  I don't really know what to do anymore.
