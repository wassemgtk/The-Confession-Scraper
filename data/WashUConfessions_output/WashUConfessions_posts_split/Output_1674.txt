Hi. The other day I sent in what was essentially an impassioned rant on discrepancies in media coverage pertaining to recent events. Now, I admit that that post came from a place of anger, but I feel somewhat disenfranchised as to why my post, which IMO makes a valid point, was not posted. I personally feel as if my voice is not valued in this conversation and that the voices of others, I suppose with more "acceptable" opinions are. I thought that this was a place for ALL WU students to express their opinions and themselves without censorship but it seems that this is not entirely the case...
