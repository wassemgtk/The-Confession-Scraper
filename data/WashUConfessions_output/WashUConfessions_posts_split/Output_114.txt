I watched the new Donald Trump ad and it stirred something deep inside me. It was a strange and uncomfortable feeling. I've always considered myself a progressive but that commercial just hit me in the stomach and made me think. Maybe we need a drastic change to politics. Maybe we need a bold new leader who doesn't hold his punches. Maybe my gut is trying to tell me something.

Turns out it was just gas.
