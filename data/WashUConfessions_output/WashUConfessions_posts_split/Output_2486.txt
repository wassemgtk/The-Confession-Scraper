I confess that I love Wash U! I respect the people who have not had  such good experiences but people should know many students are happy here. I love my friends, I love St. Louis, and the only sad thing is that I have to graduate this spring. Wash U is the best college I could have chosen - I would not have grown so much anywhere else.

Also, to all of you who can only see the darkness right now, that was me in high school! I was so depressed I did not make it out of bed most days. Get some help and just keep on going and your life really can become completely different! Give it time and do not give up, you are so capable of living a happy life, something I never believed when I was depressed but it is true :)
