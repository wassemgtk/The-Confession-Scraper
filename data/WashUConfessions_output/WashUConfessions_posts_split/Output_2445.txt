I confess today is the first day I ever read Wash U Confessions. I felt compelled to post something and did! Eventually I saw it posted and was thrilled to see the comments and likes. Now my post is gone. Do you edit/censor posts prior to being posted only or do you take them down after they're up if someone gets upset and complains? Does the University have any control over what's allowed to get posted here?
