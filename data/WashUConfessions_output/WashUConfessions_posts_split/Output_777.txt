Growing up, my mom always told me that I didn't need to worry about the fact that I wasn't interested in clothes or make-up and that I wasn't physically attractive; I was a "smart girl" and God only gives us so much, so I shouldn't feel bad that I couldn't be both. I came to WashU, and that worldview was shattered. The girls here are physically attractive AND smart. I felt like an outsider. I now realize that I'm not the kind of girl that guys are interested in. The fact that I am a rising senior and have never been in a relationship or had a first kiss solidifies in my mind that it will never happen for me. I am scared that no guy will ever be interested in me. I'm not writing this for reassurance of any sort, considering you don't know me. I'm writing this because I need to say it, even if it's anonymous.
