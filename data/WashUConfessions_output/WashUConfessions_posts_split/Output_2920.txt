Today, I had an intense thermodynamic conversation with my self, about figuring out whether or not I should pour a room temperature bottle of v8 into a cold bottle of v8 that had been in the fridge all day, or vice versa. The cold bottle had about half as much juice as the warm bottle. This took a while of heavy debating. In actuality, I could have just directly enjoyed my v8. What has school done to me?
