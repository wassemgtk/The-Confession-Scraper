I don't want to make this an anti-male post or generalize here, but I have to say that I've come to realize there is a significant percentage of men who are pigs. Three situations happened in the past week alone.

First, a man I had been dating for the past few months (who I left because he was only interested in sex) tried to fool my best friend into falling for him without telling her who he was when HE KNEW she was my best friend. Luckily I found out in the nick of time.

Second, another man who I have been dating, tried to ask out another one of my best friends. This one however didn't know me and her were close. When she informed him of his mistake, he says, "Oh well, I'm talking to you now." The way he objectified her to her face is disgusting. Just because I wasn't his girlfriend doesn't mean he can disrespect the loyalty two female friends have to each other.

Finally, the last man who I personally know has a girlfriend and a child to take care of, started telling my friend how beautiful she was and how he wanted to go out with her (conveniently not mentioning his home situation). The most disturbing thing about all of this is, the deceit; and I'm not saying that women don't do this too (they do!) but if my girlfriends and I hadn't been a little more clever than usual and sharing our stories, we all would have been played and so many people could have gotten hurt. All for what, physical pleasure? I now have serious trust issues.
