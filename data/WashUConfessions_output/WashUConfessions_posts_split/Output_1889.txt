I think people are misunderstanding what some people like post #1922 and the "depressing" #1919 are trying to say. They aren't pointing out that ALL jobs require a good GPA, or that to "be the next Bill Gates" (as unlikely as #1922 points out) you must have a 4.0. I think the main idea of #1919 is that, for the specific student who is pre-med, which is not everyone, GPA does matter, and that it is naive to say otherwise. It may be unfortunate that that is the way admissions to medical schools are set up, but it's not going to change anytime soon: GPA is a major preliminary determinant of whether a school considers to invite you to an interview. 

It obviously isn't the only thing, but when they have thousands of applications to screen, I am positive that they go through rounds of screenings where they first look for minimum GPA and MCAT requirements before looking at your extracurriculars and what-have-you. So to the people telling their pre-med friends to stress less about classes/working hard for that A in a class, and more on "doing what you love," that may not be the best advice. Because if being pre-med and studying science isn't what someone loves, and learning/studying something they're willing to devote many, many more years to, then it may be time to consider a different career choice. 

Being a physician requires people who love learning, as it is a continuous process. This isn't to say you can't have other passions too, of course; we don't want our future doctors to be robotic bookworms. At the same time, we want them to be qualified, and thorough, and as all-knowing as possible. This, unfortunately or not, is reflected to medical schools by doing well academically. Yes, "fit" to a medical school matters, but for people with an inadequate GPA, it isn't even about fit yet. It sucks, but GPA and other metrics like the MCAT are the way schools can evaluate all students without bias (keeping in consideration of course factors that may have prevented the student from doing super well on these things, such as having a job, etc.). So it is pointless to say "I got ___ job with a *
