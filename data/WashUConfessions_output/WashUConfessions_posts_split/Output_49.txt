The lady at the world fusion station at BD remembered who I was, even though I haven't been in probably 1.5 years, since I moved off campus. Honestly it made my day. One thing I'll miss when I graduate is the friendly staff. Take a moment to talk to someone who works here-- it might make their day, just like she made mine
