I wish my ex could see how well I'm doing now. Four months ago, I honestly didn't think I'd recover from what I can only describe as a catastrophic breakup; now, I'm about to start a new chapter of my life and not only am I happy, but I'm proud of myself and impressed by what I've accomplished. I know it's petty and I know it wouldn't make him want me back, but I keep thinking about how good it would feel to know that he's aware that, after all those years of me thinking that he was my everything, I'm not just moving on. I'm succeeding.
