A lot of people feel judged for having scholarships or work study jobs, but I honestly feel judged for the exact opposite: not qualifying for work study or financial aid. I feel like those of us who pay full tuition get so much shit because we can afford it and most people can't. Truth is, I feel really guilty that I can afford it and that my parents have to pay it, but I'm afraid I might be accused of taking someone else's opportunity if I try to get a job or scholarship to help pay for it. And I doubt I could get one, since everything on campus is pretty much reserved for work study.
