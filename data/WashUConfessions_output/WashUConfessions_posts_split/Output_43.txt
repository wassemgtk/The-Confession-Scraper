I am of mixed Asian descent and my family immigrated before I started pre-K. I carry parts of my parents' cultures as a part of me, but I don't really identify with either of their home countries.

I was raised in America, and this is all I remember.

I am an American citizen.

It doesn't bother me when you ask about my ethnicity, but when you tell me I'm not American, it displaces me.

I vote! I eat burgers and pizza! I fly *American* Airlines! I've had the quintessential summer camp experience! 

I do not fit into your black and white Venn diagram, but please, don't invalidate my experience, my existence. If you insist I am not American, please, someone, tell me what I really am.
