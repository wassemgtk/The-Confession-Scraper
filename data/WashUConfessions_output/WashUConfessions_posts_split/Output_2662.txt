I confess that I'm actually interested in trying drugs beyond smoking and drinking in a moderate and healthy way but i don't think any of my friends would approve or be interested as well and its something i really don't want to look into on my own. I just wish i had a friend who was really chill about things like that and went harder but never let things get out of control you know?
