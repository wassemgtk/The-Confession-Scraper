I confess that I regret telling anyone when it happened that I might have been sexually assaulted.

I was so confused at the time, there were so many layers to the incident, and I personally didn't remember anything that happened. When I woke up in the morning, I looked around and felt my stomach drop and horror wash over me as I saw my clothes in the corner and someone I considered one of my best friends asleep beside me.

I know drunken hookups aren't exactly uncommon, but when I recounted the night separately to a few close friends, each one independently came to the conclusion that what had happened was rape - he wasn't as drunk as I was, and I was blackout.

But I didn't want to think of myself as a rape victim, and I couldn't put the burden of that label onto my friend - it felt so wrong. How could I consciously continue to be friends with someone I thought had raped me? How could that one night erase years of friendship?

It hurt more to temporarily give up that friendship than it did when some of the few people who knew chose sides or blamed me for what happened. Because the thing is, people don't want to change their lives for your problems. They tell you that under no circumstances can you have another alcohol-related fuck up, yet they get upset when you won't come out and drink with them. They tell you that you can't be friends with someone who would hurt you like this, yet they want you all to hang out and carry on as if nothing happened. They wanted me to change my life without having to feel the ripples suffuse through theirs, and that was the most frustrating.

I don't think he raped me - the intent wasn't there. The horror I felt may have paralleled that of an actual rape victim, but I can't honestly say that the situation wasn't my fault. I don't drink anymore, and we are friends, but I wish I had never told anyone else what had happened. If no one knew, then no one could judge me for being a hypocrite, for causing so much drama at the time and for trying to act like none of this ever happened now that I'm finally emotionally okay.
