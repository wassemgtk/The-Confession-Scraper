YO so I got a smart phone just like most people these days.  I think the technology is just fuckin amazing and super convenient, I mean it's like having a little computer in your pocket at all times.  However, sometimes I am saddened when I walk around between classes and see a ton of people looking down at their phone instead of taking in life.  I mean don't get me wrong I do that shit sometimes and ya if you gotta be in contact with someone then sure it makes sense, but how about we put away our phones for once and just enjoy our surroundings and take in the world because it's pretty dope!
