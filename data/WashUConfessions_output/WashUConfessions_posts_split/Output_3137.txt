Hearing beautiful songs like Mirrors by JT and Next to Me by Emeli Sande make me yearn for someone. I am a junior, and have not had a major crush on anyone in high school. And I miss that feeling. I miss feeling my heart race when I see someone, flirting to feel their eyes on me and not because I feel like I have to hook up with someone. I just want to be loved and in love. And the more I search for it, the harder it seems to grasp. I am so jealous of people in happy, functioning relationships, and yet, it makes me so happy to see them happy. I try to count my blessings, to fill my life with friendships, but its not enough anymore. I want to be in love.
