I am very fortunate to have a parent who makes a ridiculous amount of money. If I didn't, I wouldn't be going to school here, or maybe I would be if I got a bunch of financial aid or something. The thing is, is my dad always pushes me to try and find more money at this school, and I constantly encounter roadblocks because of need-based everything. I would feel bad, if I end up getting funding instead of someone else who "needed" it more, but when I'm doing work for this school for free because my area won't hire non-work study students, I'm not exactly thrilled. I'm just sad that I literally can't get paid for doing work that takes a lot of time and effort. But its relevant to my future so I do it anyways. I am privileged  for sure, but sometimes I feel a tad exploited because my work is always free. Except psych experiments, my other job...
