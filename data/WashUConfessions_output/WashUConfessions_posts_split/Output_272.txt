sions â€” Unfiltered has been released.

This gives you a chance to see almost any confession that has been submitted, regardless of whether it was posted on the Wash U Confessions page.  

Sometimes, there's good content in a submission but it can't be posted because it just doesn't fit on the Facebook page. Unfiltered gives a chance for those sorts of submissions to be viewed. 

I understand there will be some concerns about the abuse of this sort of feature. Content such as hate speech, suicide letters, and advertisements for shitty clubs will be removed before making it onto the Unfiltered page.

Enjoy the weekend, the semester's almost over!
