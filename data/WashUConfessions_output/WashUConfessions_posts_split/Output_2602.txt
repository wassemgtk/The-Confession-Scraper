I am an alumni of Wash U, and I just found out about this page. It seems that many of you are very stressed with school life that some are in extreme depression (mainly because you compare yourself with others). As a Wash U grad who lived few years more than you guys, I have to say that GPA and what you do in college DO NOT determine your life. Life is very unpredictable and what you do in college is very small portion of your life. If you are very depressed because of your poor performance, just let it be!! Just live a happy life, and you might still end up with good opportunities. I graduated from Wash U with 2.63 GPA. I basically went to all the parties at Wash U and even extended my "play-ground" to Saint Louis University and Fontbonne University. I made friends there and even went to those schools' parties. In short, I was not studying at all!! But I still ended up meeting someone at the party who happened to know a lot of people working at Wall Street, and I ...somehow... (I know. It is very strange) ended up working at the one of the top five investment bank. I was not happy with GPA, but I was happy with my life. Most importantly, I learned to communicate and have happy time with people.

My point is that your life is not over if you have a low GPA as life is very unpredictable. If you can handle your studies and still find time for fun, that's great!! But if you can't, don't stress out!
Okay!  I think I talked too much~ Go to bed guys :)
