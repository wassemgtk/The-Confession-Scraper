When I opened up my Webstac and saw that I got a D in Gen Chem and a C in Chem Lab, I expected to feel shame and disappointment. My high school 4.0 gpa dashed, my shot at getting into a good Med School ruined.

I didn't feel shame and disappointment- in fact, I felt relief.
I think now I can take the time to step back and reevaluate this career that my parents have wanted for me since birth. Now, I can take the time to truly be free.
