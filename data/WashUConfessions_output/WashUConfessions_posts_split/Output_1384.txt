Three people I know got into med school recently. I know for a fact that each and every one of them cheated on the Bio 2960 final freshman year. They had hidden notecards and went to the bathroom to look shit up. I'm beginning to think that if you don't cheat, you don't have a chance at med school. If you decide to cheat, realize that you are leaving a peace of your soul behind every time. Shit will come back one day and bite you in the ass.
