I just broke up with a guy I've been with since May. Last night I agreed to watch a movie with a guy I met at a TKE mixer. I was really anxious. I don't do casual hookups and I figured that was all he wanted. We ended up watching my favorite movie, cuddling a little. And that was it. Some girls might have been discouraged by the lack of a move. But I'm ecstatic. I just want to see him again. Lesson to guys, sometimes doing nothing is the most attractive thing you can do.
