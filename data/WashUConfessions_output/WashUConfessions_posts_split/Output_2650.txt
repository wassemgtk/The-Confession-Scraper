I'm sick and tired of everyone hating on all the humanities degrees. I get that pre-med is super hard and important and you're gonna save someone's life one day, but that doesn't mean you should judge us and think we're slackers. We have massive writing and reading assignments every week, you do complicated labs and problem sets. Everyone has to work hard to get where they want to go, they just work in different ways. Don't judge someone for wanting to follow their passion, because you wouldn't want them to judge you for yours.
