I confess that I was abused as a child emotionally and physically. When I hear students say how their professor "abused them" because they got a D on their paper, I freeze and panic. Please do not use the word  lightly, because it really is a serious matter. Parents abuse their children - it happened to me and it could have happened to anyone else on this campus.
