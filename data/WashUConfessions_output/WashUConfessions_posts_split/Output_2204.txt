I love my Boyfriend but he is really lazy. He would rather watch Anime, play his X-Box or  sleep all day before actually wanting to get work done. I am really ambitious and think about my future everyday and it is difficult being with someone who doesn't have those "hustler"/ ambitious qualities. I've talked about it with him month after month and he'll change for a week and then go back to doing work at the last minute (causing low grades) forgetting to take care of important business related things and not being there for me and motivating me just like I motivate him. It's gotten to the point where I basically told him he needs to delete his Anime apps on his phone, put up the X-box and bring up important things in our relationship. We've agreed that until he can start acting like an adult he needs to put childish things aside, however, he keeps asking me if he can watch TV or play the game etc etc. I feel like a mother who has to babysit a child. I can't sit here and let him ruin his life but I also don't want to feel like a mother. I see all these other ambitious guys and I wish he would be ambitious like them...He helps me to see the other side of life other than work but then again he doesn't work hard enough to improve his own life. I feel like this is a representation of what it will be like in the future if we stay together. I love him but I think I deserve a man..not a child...when I tried to tell him we needed a break so he could get his stuff together he cried and well..we're still together..I don't think I wanted to completely break it off either but I'm not sure what to do.
