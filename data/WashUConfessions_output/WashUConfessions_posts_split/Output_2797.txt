I've been having casual sex with this guy and I like him and all...it's just...Im not capable of love so I can't be with him even though he is really into me/wants to take the relationship further. I'm afraid he's getting too attached. I also feel kinda bad because I sleep with other people as well but if he knew it would crush him. I think he's trying to overcompensate in bed as some way of trying to keep me...
