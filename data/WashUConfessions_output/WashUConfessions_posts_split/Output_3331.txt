"In appreciation to THE DANFORTH FOUNDATION" for establishing a library technology endowment unique among academic libraries." - plaque outside the ARC lab What a fucking joke. Half the library computers don't even let you log on, and the ones that do are infuriatingly slow. Even the printers are miserable. Seems like Wash U needs to reassess the efficiency of the Danforth Foundation technology endowment.
