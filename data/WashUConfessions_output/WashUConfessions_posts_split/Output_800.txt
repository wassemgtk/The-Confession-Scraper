Navigating health care on my own has been pretty interesting. I've discovered that SHS is useless but that was my own fault for giving them the benefit of the doubt.

I encourage everyone to take a look at their health care coverage  because you might be 100% covered for all preventative care services and women's preventative care (copays as well) but clueless people will try and charge you (that includes some insurance companies trying to pull shit over on you and health care providers).
