I have trichotillomania (I'm addicted to pulling my hair out). This is one of the most stigmatized diseases out there and people don't seem to understand. The media portrays us as freaks and even groups promoting mental health awareness rarely mention it. The only person I've ever told is my dad. I'm too afraid to tell my friends even though I really wish I had some more support. This is the hardest thing I've ever had to go through. I don't want to do it, I don't know why I do it, and I can't fucking stop. I miss classes, waste hours, and cause myself a ridiculous amount of pain, depression, and anxiety because of this awful disease. I've been in and out of different treatment programs for a year and nothing seems to work. I feel so frustrated and alone.
