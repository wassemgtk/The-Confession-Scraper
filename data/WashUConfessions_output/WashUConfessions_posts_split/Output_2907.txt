I am sick and tired of people blaming the world's troubles on "the corporations". The other day I overheard a girl ranting about how evil corporations are ON HER IPHONE. Seriously, who do you think invented the iPhone for her convenient use? A CORPORATION DID! I hate hypocrisy, and that really pissed me off. Corporations create things that make everyday life easier for everybody, not just the rich. Some of them are bad, but most of them improve society. I wish that Wash U kids put more thought into what comes out of their mouth.
