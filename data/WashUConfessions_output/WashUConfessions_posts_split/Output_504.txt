So I'm not sure if this is a confession or a soap box.

When i first came as a freshman, people were all pretty open about making new friends. As a sophomore, people were a little open.

As a Junior and senior, people seem to just stick to friend groups and don't really open up to making new friends and it kind of sucks since I never solidly settled into any friend group.

Seems like you have to either be in a club/team with people or it's simply people you knew since you were a sophomore.
