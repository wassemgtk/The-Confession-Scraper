I confess that I have a serious problem with procrastination. Sure, I know most people struggle with it too, but for me, it seems like I can never focus on one assignment without having to go onto Facebook or listen to YouTube. It's even gotten to the point that I would spend an hour or so browsing the internet with no purpose. Initially, since it kind of started at the end of my high school career, I thought it was senioritis. However, as I progressed through my college career until now (I'm a junior), it has become more prevalent. The worse case was just a few weeks ago when I have a paper due and I finally decided to do it a hour before the due date. Unfortunately, I did not get it finished, and I'm pretty sure it was a terrible paper. Plus, I blame my procrastination on why I received a C in Bio I, Chem II, and Orgo I (which was a summer course).

While I currently have a 3.21 GPA, I feel inadequate compared to my friends and peers who are struggling but are able to maintain a GPA above 3.5. My friends and my parents often comfort me by saying that "Everyone does it." That's true, but I feel like I do it too much. And the thing is, I tried a lot of techniques: scheduling; planners; setting thirty-minute limits; studying with others; studying away from my room. They either don't work or work for only a short amount of time. Maybe I'm just too weak-willed.

I know that there are people who are not doing as well academically as I am, and I know that everyone struggles with procrastination, but I would like to at least manage it better so I don't end up with a GPA that is undesirable for the grad schools I am applying. Does anyone have any suggestions?
