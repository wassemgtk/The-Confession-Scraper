Seeing #3098, what troubles me is the lack of initiative people at Wash U have. We see a problem, ask why it isn't being fixed, but then don't do our part to make that a reality. Be the change you want to see-- the reason we don't have an anti-ISIS club is because nobody has created one, including the submitter of the last post.
