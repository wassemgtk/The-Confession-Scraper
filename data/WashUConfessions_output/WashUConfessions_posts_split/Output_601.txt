It makes me so angry when people witch hunt accused people online before they've had their day in court. It seems like every week I'm reading about another innocent person pushed to kill themselves by the social media mobs.

I guess it hits me harder than most, too, when Sunil Tripathi was a friend of mine from high school. And I can't even talk to people about this because they accuse me of wanting to cover up for criminals.
