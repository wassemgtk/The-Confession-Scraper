Regarding the Ferguson decision, I have not heard a single story from either the media or politicians which I believe to be impartial. The structural system of our country seems far too censored and biased to be trusted anymore. I can hardly imagine what the jury is feeling right now knowing that their decision is going to make international headlines when even the information they receive is likely biased. It would be absolutely great if we, as the people, could actually get some impartial and factual information out of the media and politicians.

Please do not mistake my position, I am very sympathetic to the side of the protesters. I believe that there are tremendous injustices being done by society against the black community which likely led to the shooting of Micheal Brown.

However, I do not believe that the officer should be held accountable for his actions if he sincerely believed that Micheal Brown was a threat. The decision that the jury is making is whether  the officer is culpable for the death of Brown. I do not have the information to determine this but I really wish I did that way I could actually take a side in this protest. Until that day comes, I will remain impartial.
I do appreciate the efforts of protests which point out the injustices being done against the black community everyday. I do not agree with the ones which assert that the officer must be held accountable. I do not believe that anyone in the public has the right to assert whether the officer is culpable because we do not have the information to determine that. We should not deride and make him a pawn simply to further a movement and make a point. I do not believe that this is the intention of most protesters, but I have seen some calling for immediate conviction of the officer. Unfortunately it is often the squeaky wheel that gets the grease, as they say. This leads to misconception and division. Let's do better as a society. Violence need not beget more violence.

As a further point, I appreciate the efforts of organizations like Anonymous which tried to make public information regarding the incident. However, hacking the twitter feed of the KKK and posting a picture of one of them hanging from a tree is doing nobody any good. This is only going to infuriate people who obviously have no regard for basic human rights and freedoms. Nothing good comes of such an action.
