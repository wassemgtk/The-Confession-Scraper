Whenever someone starts monologuing to me and I'm not in agreement with it, I'll think of some power metal song with a good beat and start nodding along to it. First it's small, but I slowly work my way up until it's a full-on headbang. It's the greatest thing watching their expression change as they begin to realize I'm not vigorously agreeing with them.
