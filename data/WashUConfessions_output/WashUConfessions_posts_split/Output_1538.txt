Whenever there's a confession that'd my girlfriend would find troubling if it came from me, she asks me if I was the one who submitted the confession. Each time I've said (honestly) that it wasn't me, but now I'm worried to confess something personal without her immediately suspecting it came from me.

We'll see what happens with this one.
