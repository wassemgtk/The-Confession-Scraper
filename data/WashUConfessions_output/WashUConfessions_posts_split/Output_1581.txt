Screw the free counseling sessions. I get all my life advice from the stalls in the second floor women's bathroom in Eads. Shout out to y'all who contributed your wisdom. From theorizing about a world where pies are baked into cakes to sharing bad cantaloupe puns and words of encouragement, my trip to Eads is always enlightening.

Guys, you're missing out.
