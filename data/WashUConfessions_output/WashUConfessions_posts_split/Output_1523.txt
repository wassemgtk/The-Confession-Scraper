I see a lot of posts on here about guys who like girls and vice versa, but in many cases, they haven't done anything about it. Why is that? I recently got rejected by a girl who I had a thing for, but I feel a whole lot better about it now than I did when I wondered every day. Moral of the story: if you really, truly like someone, let them know. Even if it doesn't turn out the way you want, you won't have any regrets, and there will be no "could have been."
