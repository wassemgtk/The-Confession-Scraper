I am writing to you not to chastise or critique, but in an attempt to encourage you to curtail what I, after careful consideration, consider to be an outrageous display of animosity towards members of the administration which are not only unrealized, but grossly distorted in the public forum. Certainly, this has not been limited to any one person, but as students and purported leaders of this community, it is our responsibility if that title is to merit any worth to conduct ourselves with grace and good judgment. While you may be disappointed or angered to learn of these changes or decisions, you may not realize the spirit in which these changes/decisions were made and proposed. It is not a vindictive assault against Washington University students, but an attempt to reach a compromise or reach decisions that would not jeopardize the future/current enrollment of this university or the integrity of the classroom experience. Secondly, being a student at Washington University is a privilege, not a right and it seems, in retrospect, to be rather selfish to place our own concerns above those of a university and a community we claim to adore. I have heard many levy claims that since we "pay" to go to Washington University, we should be allowed to do whatever we want. But is that how a community works? Excuse the expression, but Washington University and its faculty and staff are not here to prostitute themselves to our every desire. But neither are we expected to dutifully acquiesce to the dictates of the administration. As part of this community, I have witnessed the sacrifices and the difficult decisions which have been made with the best interest of this university in mind. I do not agree with all of them and those which I feel present a serious enough offense against the integrity of this institution I have made a point to speak out against. And whenever I have felt the need to do so, I have always been granted an audience and graciously received. We do not have to resort to bashing on Facebook etc. And consider this: who else is reading these rants? Prospective employers? Graduate schools? The next generation of Washington University students? And what will they see but hateful spewing and petty bickering over the administration. If your concern truly lies with preserving Washington University, then we need to end this meaningless and divisive attitude. We need to recognize that our goal is shared and work together to ensure that Washington University remains a cherished academic opportunity for students many years from now. What precedent will it set for the classes to come that any change/decision is met with tremendous volatility rather than constructive compromise or resolution? To demonize professors, staff and the administration inexcusably disregards the fact that their concern lies in ensuring that we protect and do not inadvertently discourage students from attending this institution who otherwise would benefit from this community. I challenge you to look beyond your own frustrations. Evolution is an imperfect process, but it is fundamentally necessary for life to continue. It is imperative for this university to continue. Surely you all can understand that should we alienate those with the ability and the desire to help us now, there will be no one willing to listen when the time comes that we truly need to be heard. Finally, I would ask that you take the time to privately and carefully take all that has been said under consideration with the understanding that while Washington University has always been a special place, it is part of a much larger world.
