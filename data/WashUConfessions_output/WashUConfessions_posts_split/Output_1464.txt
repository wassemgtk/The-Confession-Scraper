This school claims to be so open-minded... but that's really not true. Here's what I mean:

I'm now a Junior, and at my time at WashU, I've considered applying/running for honoraries and SU stuff and such. However, I never actually went through with any of those. I was afraid that my political views (center to center-right) would cause me to be shunned by others in those groups.

And I know a bunch of y'all probably want to comment on this and say that that's not true and all of these groups are open to other opinions. This is very much not my experience. In earlier years, I would have considered myself a member of Pride Alliance. Now, though, I haven't been to a meeting in over a year because when I went, I would always feel out of place. I never felt comfortable to share my opinion.

The bigger problem is that this political closed-mindedness is really delaying progress. I'm very socially liberal: pro same-sex marriage, pro choice, and I've been (somewhat) active in the Black Lives Matter movement. I really want to see social progress, but this is not the way to do it. When you shun those with other ideas, you only discuss with people who agree with you. A monologue won't solve anything. The only way we can actually make a change happen is if we engage in a dialogue: every opinion has a reason behind it. Yelling at people to "check [their] privilege" without even explaining what that means turns a potential discussion into a monologue, and is only inflammatory to social conservatives.

I'm all about what we do here at this school: we really fight for justice and equality. But the approaches many of the student groups take to address these issues is flawed and counterproductive.
