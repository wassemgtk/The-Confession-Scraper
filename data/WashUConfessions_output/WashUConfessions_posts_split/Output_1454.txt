I've been struggling with depression for a long time, and at my lowest points I self-harmed and had thoughts of suicide. But maybe it's because things have been going well for me lately (honestly, I don't know), but I've realized that I haven't had these kinds of thoughts for a while. The people I've met here have been so kind and accepting that it makes me so happy and thankful for the support I feel here at WashU.

It's an ongoing battle, one that I've finally reached out for help with, but still, I'm so glad I'm here.

Thank you.
