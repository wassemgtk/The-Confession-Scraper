There is a homeless man who lives on the loop and asks me for change a couple times a day. I don't tend to carry change nor do I have the money to give him change a couple of times a day so I generally offer an apologetic no. A few weeks ago, I bought him a full meal, but he does not seem to remember me. Today I was in the middle of a serious phone conversation when he asked me for money so I didn't answer him. He started rudely calling out after me like I was this horrible person for ignoring him the hundredth time he had disturbed me. It bugs me that I have to deal with this every day. Homelessness sucks. I just happened to have been born into a middle class family while he lives on the streets. He may have done this to himself or he may have just had some really bad luck. He may use the money for drugs or he may use it to buy food. Who am I to judge him. I would probably be rude to people too if I had to live like that. But at the same time, dealing with him everyday is annoying and upsetting. I am really torn on this whole situation and I wish there was something I could do to help end homelessness for good.
