I confess that the one thing that annoys me more than ANYTHING at this school is when people think they're somehow better than other students here because they went to some private high school where the tuition was higher than that of WashU.

It's normal to have pride in your high school, but they drop the names of their schools in normal conversations and just expect that everyone knows exactly what they're talking about. It doesn't matter if your school is the 4th best boarding school in the country. I still had never heard of it until I saw the 7 shirts you're constantly wearing.

In my opinion, the quality of education is no higher whatsoever than what you could get from a standard AP or IB program. I mean, it's all fundamentals anyway. It's more likely that your parents spent the $40,000/year for the sole purpose of getting you to conform to their ideal lifestyle. The same uniforms every day, the same way of thinking about the world, etc.

I'm honestly so happy I didn't have the opportunity to go anywhere but a large public high school. It forced me to become more self-sufficient, brought me all types of experiences, taught me to question everything and think for myself rather than blindly accept what generations before you have laid down as fact, and it allowed me to be a kid.
