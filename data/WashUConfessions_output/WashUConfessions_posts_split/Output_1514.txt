Post as a new confession or a response to 2299.  Not sure which, just want people to stop kidding themselves about this whole "subsidize college crap"

No one wants to say it?  Well then.  Guess I'll be the bad guy.  The cold hard truth is that the world will always need McDonald's employees and Taxi Drivers and Delivery People and Retail Cashiers.  Imagine for a second that our government spent millions (maybe even billions) to give all the McDonald's employees college degrees which they then never used.  You all who payed for that would be screaming in the streets.  Not to mention, high paying jobs would just start wanting to see a graduate degree.  The fact is, there is will always be two stages in education.  The baseline that you must reach to be a healthy functioning adult (can we all agree that's definitely 8th grade if not high school?).  And then the extra that high profile jobs look for because they want to know you're a cut above the rest (in pursuit of knowledge and socioeconomic standing).  So fine, go ahead and subsidize college.  Move the "baseline" I talked about to a college degree.  See if that really changes anything...

TLDR.  Subsidizing college will dilute its value.  A college degree will become the new High School diploma and graduate degree will be the new college degree.
