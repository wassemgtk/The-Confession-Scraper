I've never been in a relationship, but I've reached a point in my life where I really want to be. Unfortunately, all the girls I know still view me as a risk because of my past promiscuity. I feel like I fucked up by exploring earlier in college because now no one my own age wants to date me and my only options are underclassmen.
