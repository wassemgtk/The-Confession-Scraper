heads up about a previous confession (#2802) - Wash U Confessions administration has not changed recently!

I know washuconfessions.com says there's a new admin, but that text has been up since September when I took over - I just never really bothered to update it. 

I also realize I said I planned on retiring last semester, but I feel like there's still some work to be done and I would like the page to be in a good place before I pass it off to the next admin.

Happy summer!
