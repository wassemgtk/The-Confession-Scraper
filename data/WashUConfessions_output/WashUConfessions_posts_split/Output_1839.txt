I'm a guy, and a few years ago I accepted money for sex.  I degraded myself for a measly hundred dollars.  I'm disgusted at what I did, and I'm still haunted by my choice.  It was an important experience, though, because it taught me to value myself.  Now I know that I'm worth more than I sold myself for.
