I'm a black person closely affiliated with BA, and I just want to honestly say that the last 48 hours have blown my mind. The show wasn't inclusive. Point blank. But it wasn't really meant to be inclusive, it was meant to showcase stories that students on our campus and around the nation have experienced. I can understand where your sense of discomfort is coming from, I identify with Sydney's desire to know more about the shooting of a person before giving my support. But the responses on YikYak (be they trolls or otherwise) were completely unwarranted and have made me feel unwelcome in an already polarizing society.

To those who complained that BA painted an unfair picture of white people. It did, and that needs to be addressed, but saying that blacks are only here because of affirmative action instead of intelligence only lends credence to the fact racism, bigotry and prejudice is alive and well on WashU's campus. There are productive ways to hold dialogues about race, posting stupid Yaks and complaining anonymously are not one of those ways.
