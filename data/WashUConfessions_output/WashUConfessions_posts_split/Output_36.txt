I know that I'm lucky to be at Wash U, and I have it better than a lot of people. But I can't help being upset that I'm paying an extra 25 grand a year over my state school, and what I get out of this extra money is worse grades and a much lower chance at achieving my dream. Admittedly I'm probably getting a better education than I would at my state school, but that doesn't matter if I can't get into med school and use that education.
