I am getting fed up with students saying that they don't want to be blamed for the actions of their forefathers. No one blames you for their actions, we blame you for your own actions: the ignorant statements, judgments, and rudeness. If you didn't act like your prejudice forefathers to minorities, then much of what we feel would be no longer present. Think about the things you do, and stop trying to stop the dialogue by saying we blame you for the actions of your ancestors. It would be interesting to see all of those making harsh comments against the BA and Black students face to face with us. Don't hide behind anonymity. If a dialogue is started formally, actually come and speak up.
