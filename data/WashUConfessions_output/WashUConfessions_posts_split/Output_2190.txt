A few days ago, as I was buying lunch at BD, one of the male workers said “you should be a model”. I was of course flattered at first by the compliment and said thank you, but then he continued to ask “why are you here? Why aren’t you a model?” and I preceded to laugh and say it was because I’ve always wanted to do science. By that time, our interaction at the cashier was over, and I was on my way. While I understand he was trying to be nice and give me a compliment, I can’t help but feel as if I am constantly having to explain my choice to pursue academia. I am a female sophomore BME student with dreams of getting a PhD and running my own research lab, but in the year and a half I have been here, I have been told numerous times “you’re too pretty to be at Wash U,” or like the cashier at BD, “you should have been a model”. I know they are well intentioned compliments, but every time I hear them  all I hear is that my nights spend studying until 3 am and the times I’ve had to sacrifice what I love for my career are all worth nothing because I’m ‘pretty’. That I, as a woman, should value beauty above all else and strive to be attractive for men.  That no matter how hard I work, my accomplishments will always matter less than my outward appearance. Yes, I am a woman. Yes, I am what you may call ‘attractive’. But I am so many other things. I am in a scholarship program. I have over a 3.75 GPA. I am committing my life to artificial organ research because my grandfather died on the transplant list.  I am here because I worked my ASS off to be here. I am here because my parents are putting a second mortgage on our house to pay for my schooling. I am here as a woman, but more importantly, as a person. So next time you tell me I’m “too pretty to be here”, dig a little bit deeper, because I can assure you I have much, much more to offer.
