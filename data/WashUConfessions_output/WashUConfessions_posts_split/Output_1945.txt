I don't have a lot of money, and most of my tuition is paid for by donors who don't even know me. I don't really like to go out because I don't have the means for $5 shots or a fake ID or whatever, and I also don't want the sacrifices my family has had to make to go to waste. I feel like I've been alienated because I don't like to go out very much. I love hanging out with other people, and would go to the parties my friends go to if I could, but I feel it's not a good use of my time or the money that people have given me. I feel like I have an obligation to those that help me to get a good education, and I don't want to disappoint them. I wish I could tell my roommates the truth, but I always just brush it off by saying parties "are not my thing". I feel like I'm judged because I don't go to many parties, but there is a lot more to the story than that.
