Not that I expect you to post this, but fuck [redacted].  I hate how WashU Confessions is frequently besieged by commenters who clearly have no connection to the school, and only a slew of (evidently negative) stereotypes to go on, e.g. "arrogant rich kids who have no idea how good they have it, and have no idea what it's like to struggle/be unhappy etc."  

I mean, obviously WashU is full of the scions of wealthy families, but that in no way means that their grievances are less legitimate, or that their suffering is any less painful.  As anyone with boatloads of money can tell you, money doesn't buy happiness, and while you can buy things to make you happy, the happiness derived from material possessions is relatively transient, and is more or less the same whether you're a Saudi prince buying a $300 million yacht, or the local drug dealer with some shiny rims (and don't worry, the former is more morally reprehensible than is the latter; this isn't a case of latent racism).
