About a year and a half ago, I was suffering from depression to the point that I was failing my classes, I couldn't get out of bed all day, I stopped eating, and every day I would stare out my 3rd-story window at the ground below and wonder how much it might hurt to jump. The warm and kind words of my friends and peers were what brought me through that. Even now I'm sure they don't know how much those words meant to me and how very important they were. To be honest I'm a bit afraid of telling them, because that would require revealing my struggle and opening my illness up for judgment from the people who unwittingly helped me the most. But know this: Words, even the seemingly insignificant ones said in passing, are incredibly powerful.
