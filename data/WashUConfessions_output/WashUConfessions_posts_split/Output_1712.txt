I thought being in a sorority would finally make me happy here, but the last three days have just been miserable for me.
I was 100% sure I was going to get into a certain sorority; it wasn't a "cool" or "popular" one, but I felt so comfortable and happy with the people that I met there and was so excited to be a part of that friendship.
Now I'm in one of the party sororities (who only took me because I'm a legacy) and I've never felt so out of place.  The girls are all prettier and cooler than me, and blatantly dismiss me or ignore me if I try to join a conversation.  I'm appalled by their focus on alcohol and how no one seems to want to hang out if it doesn't involve drinking.  I don't know what to do.  I'm crying all the time, thinking about where I am now and where I was so thrilled to be.  I wanted to be in Greek life so badly, but now I just feel humiliated.
