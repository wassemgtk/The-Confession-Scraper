Even as a girl I don't get all the uproar over the different expectations regarding men and women's sexual behavior. To me it's not a matter of "double standards", it's more like women HAVING standards. I feel like instead of trying to be more like men and make people accept promiscuity in women, us ladies should try to be CIVILIZING our fellow menfolk. Let's encourage them to commit! It may be unfair that people look down more on a woman who sleeps around, but on the flip-side, who looks at a man-whore and thinks "wow, he seems like great boyfriend material"? We women should respect ourselves enough to hold ourselves to a higeher standard.
