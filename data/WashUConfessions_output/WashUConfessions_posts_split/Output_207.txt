It really gives me pause when I see people of my age write impassioned diatribes about how to fix certain issues that are riddled with bad spelling, grammar, and punctuation. It communicates to me that they think they can fix the world, and yet either don't care enough to use English properly or don't care enough to check for errors, which means, of course, they're probably rushing into things and not sweating the details, as young adults are wont to do. 

I should like to think that such simple solutions could work, but the devil is in those little details. I fear we've instilled in ourselves a culture that doesn't see that.
