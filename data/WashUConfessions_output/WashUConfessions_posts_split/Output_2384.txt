I am a touchy-feely person who is very (platonically) physically affectionate. I love hugs and cuddles and find the experience of sleeping next to someone absolutely better than sleeping alone. Sometimes I wish there was a societally acceptable way to ask a friend if they wanted to share a bed with you and snuggle. And yet, I'm finding that while I used to be relaxed and carefree about this, I notice myself now wondering if the other person is assuming things that aren't true, or if I'm leading them on unintentionally, or wondering what people would think. I hate that I do this now, because even though there are nights I ache for companionship, I feel like I'm not sully enjoying it on the occasions I get to have it.
