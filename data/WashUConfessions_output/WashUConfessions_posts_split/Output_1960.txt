When I was younger, if I didn't bring back a good grade (anything above a B), my dad would scream at me so hard that it frightened me. There was even a time when I forgot to bring home an assignment and he beat me with a shoe. After that incident, I became so terrified of the consequences that I was sure never to screw up. My brother who is a middle schooler is in a similar situation, and my dad has even resorted to paddling him on a few occasions.

People may read this and think that it is abuse, but I don't know what to think of it. I realize that he just wants his kids to always be hard working, but then again taking it to his extremes is a totally different story.

I still love my dad, and he hasn't lay a hand on me in years, but sometimes I will just start thinking about these incidents and wondering if it was abuse or not. I don't feel so troubled by it that I would want to go to counseling, but I would like the opinions of certain people before I form my own conclusion about what happened and decide whether or not to seek help.
