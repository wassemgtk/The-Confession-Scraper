This is a question more than a confession: To all of the many Jewish students on campus, how big of a factor is religion when considering dating someone? I realize that this is completely dependent on the person and dependent on the type of relationship being considered, but as a Catholic with primarily Jewish dating prospects, I'd like to hear a range of opinions. (I also realize that this question applies to other religions as well, but after all, this is Wash Jew...)
