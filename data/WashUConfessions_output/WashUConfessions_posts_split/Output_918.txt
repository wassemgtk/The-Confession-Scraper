I just want to say that I've had a crush on this girl on my floor since the first week of classes. We grew very close the first semester, but then drifted apart when we came back second semester. All I want to say is if you know this is you, I care so much about you and want you to be the happiest you can be. I may not be able to give you what you want in a guy, but as long as I'm around you when you're happy (even if that means you're with someone else) that will be enough for me. Don't stop being who you are for anyone! You're amazing and will do amazing things!
