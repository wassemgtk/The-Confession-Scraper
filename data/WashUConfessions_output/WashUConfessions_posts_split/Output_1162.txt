The true test of one's character is finals week.
Honestly, if you can make it through reading/finals week without questioning your purpose in life, hating everyone, pulling out white hairs while procrastinating, eating obscenely/not eating at all, becoming nocturnal/struggling to find the balance between sleeping too little and too much, trying to remember why again you chose to come here, crying yourself to sleep, or contracting some serious illness... you're doing it all wrong. It's the last week, and it's so easy to give into all the punches life keep throwing at us. But who we are is how we choose to react to these circumstances. Stay strong strong, WashU. The end is near. Just put your all into these final few days, and don't let the stress get to you.
