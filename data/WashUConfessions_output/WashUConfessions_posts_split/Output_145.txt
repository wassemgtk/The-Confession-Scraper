I was walking towards Rudolph Hall on Friday afternoon and a dark-haired girl gave me the most beautiful smile I have ever seen. In reply, I frowned like Ebenezer Scrooge himself. I looked back 5 seconds later and we made eye contact for the last time. I didn't run after her as I reasoned "there can't be that many people at Wash U - I'll see her again". No luck so far...
