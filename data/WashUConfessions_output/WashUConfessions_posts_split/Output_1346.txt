I want to confess it all, but I'm scared. I want to tell my friends to stop commenting on me being rich. I might have been once but now my family is in crippling debt and there is nothing I can say. I want to tell my friends the smiles and laughs I put on everyday aren't real. I want to find a girlfriend but every time I get close enough she isn't ready for one. I want to cry but I'm too scared to look weak. I haven't been happy in a long time and I don't know how to tell anyone I need help.
