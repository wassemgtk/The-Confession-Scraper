While I completely agree that children shouldn't feel forced into bad decisions due to peer pressure, I feel like a little bit of peer pressure is a good thing. I know I've done some stupid things because my brother/cousins/friends goaded me into it, but I also feel like because of this, I'm more capable of doing something I want to do, even if it's scary or uncomfortable at first. I worry that the current atmosphere of trying to keep kids protected from everything might actually be hurting them in the long run.
