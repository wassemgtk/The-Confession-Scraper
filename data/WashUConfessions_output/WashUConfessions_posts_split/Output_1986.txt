I really hate it when everyone thinks that I'm one of those who would be mad over a B, is super conscientious, super organized, and really into studying and getting good grades. I know as a fact that many of the people who think that way have better grades than I do and handle life much better than I do. Although I do think grades are important I can't be further away from putting it to supreme importance. I've gotten a C, a D+ and even failed a class during my Wash U career and only pulled my GPA back to a decent level after three semesters' crazy hard work. I am even having trouble talk about my past grades with my recommenders because "you just do not seem like someone who has not done well". Every single time I see/hear such perceptions I cannot help but wondering whether it's because I'm Asian, I'm super fat and unattractive or I'm just plain socially awkward. That shatters my self esteem every single time.
