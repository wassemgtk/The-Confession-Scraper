I love talking to the BD workers. There's just something awesome about being able to connect to people who understand you or can relate to you in some way. It's just hard as a black person to go to a school with 1 billion (majority wealthy) white people who have the luxury of connecting and being able to automatically get the same feeling I get when I see someone who looks like me. You guys have the opportunity to connect with people who probably have similar lifestyles as you and if not that, can on some kind of level, surface or not, relate! Don't take this privilege for granted. I only wish there were more people of color here.. I wish I had more of an opportunity to see people who look like me...who (possibly) like what I like. I would also reach out to people who are different from myself in order to expand my understanding of those who may come from a different background. It's not fair but idk... Reach out to people who don't look like you sometimes. Have an open mind. Invite people in... Make people feel welcome.. Sometimes people may not feel like they are accepted.. Show them differently. I don't want your pity.. But I do want you to understand that the racial and economic inequalities at this school can negatively affect people who do not fit in that category..
