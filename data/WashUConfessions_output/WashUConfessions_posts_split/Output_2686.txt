Every single person at WashU seems to be so incredibly talented in at least one way or another. Honestly, I feel like I don't belong here. My grades aren't good, my social life has never been the greatest, and I don't seem to have anything going for me. Each day I feel more inferior to the people here and consequently more hopeless about my own future. Looking around me, everyone is super involved and always so busy, and yet they still manage to pull off everything they do so well. As for me? I've tried to get more involved and I've applied for so many things, but I never get selected because there are always so many people here that are simply just a better choice. I think everyone here is so incredible - I just wish I wasn't the outlier.
