"Hey, I really want to make sure people come to this event, it is for poster 1299, and I think it would be a great instance where Wash U Confessions is able to do something for someone in real life, to really actually make a difference. I made a facebook event for the poster's party, but I can't share it here officially since I am not the Page owner. Can you Share Event to the Wash U Confessions page?
