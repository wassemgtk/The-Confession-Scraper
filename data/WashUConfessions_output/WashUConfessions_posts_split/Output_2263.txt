As a POC, I think all this white privilege discussion, while not inaccurate, hurts our community. It gives people an easy out if they aren't successful and teaches them to pin their struggles on white people. Yeah it's harder for us to be successful, and yeah a lot of that is because of systemic racism, but it's possible for us to take advantage of a society that's working proactively to integrate pro-minority policies, and constantly bringing up discussions that divide us don't do anything to help the problem. If anything they just make white people pissy and defensive, even if for PCs sake they outwardly go along with it. Not to mention that policies like AA only degrade the value of any achievement today...
