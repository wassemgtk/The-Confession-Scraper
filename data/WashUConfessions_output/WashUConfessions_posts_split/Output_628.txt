My father is working for an engineering company that's helping MacDonald's develop machines to replace the cashiers in store, and he tells me they've had some big breakthroughs recently. It's gonna be great not having my order screwed up all the time and also making the process more efficient. Plus it'll reduce costs for MacDonald's and (hopefully) their prices won't keep skyrocketing.
