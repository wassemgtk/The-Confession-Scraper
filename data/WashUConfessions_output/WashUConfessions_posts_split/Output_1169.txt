I’m about to graduate, and wanted to throw in a positive confession… I just want to say that when I first came to Wash U, I felt an immediate sense of belonging.  After having a not-so-great high school experience, at Wash U I found people I could connect with.  Everyone was a little nerdy, a little awkward, but incredibly friendly, hardworking, and supportive.  Sure, there were plenty of rough patches, there were some things about Wash U that I didn’t like, and I probably spent way too many days in the library… but for all of you who are currently struggling through finals or wishing you had just gone to a state school, there’s something I want you to hear: Yes, Wash U is hard.  But if you tough it out, I promise you are going to look back on your time here and feel proud of what you accomplished and thankful for the people you met along the way.  I think there’s something incredibly special about this place and I’m really going to miss it.
