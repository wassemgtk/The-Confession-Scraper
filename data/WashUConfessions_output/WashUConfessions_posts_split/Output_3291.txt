I've gotten multiple numbers from girls at parties thanks solely to liquid confidence. I feel horrible because I've never texted one of them back, but the idea of talking to this person who I drunkenly made out with is terrifying. That, and I have no clue what I said while drunk to convince them I was make-out worthy.
