The other day, I said goodbye to someone I’ve come to truly care for this semester, and even though I know I’ll see him again in just a few months, I can’t help but wonder whether I missed my only opportunity to tell him how I feel. I confess that I cried a bit that night, but I’m happy I did. It’s been a long time since I’ve set my emotions free without berating myself for weakness. Honestly, I think it takes strength to feel, and I’m so glad I feel again.
