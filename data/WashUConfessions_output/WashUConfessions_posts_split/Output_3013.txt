sion #820

I am frankly disgusted by what what happened, or rather, what didn't happen at WashU yesterday. Yesterday marked the anniversary of the worst terrorist attack in our nation's history. And I heard nothing about it. No commemorative service. No moment of silence. Nothing. Regardless of background, we are citizens of the United States and it horrifies me that no one could be bothered to remember that on the day that 3,000 innocent men, women and children lost their lives. Maybe this is just healing, but I certainly don't feel any better.
