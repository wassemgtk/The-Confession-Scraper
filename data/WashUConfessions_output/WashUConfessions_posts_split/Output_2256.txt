Alumni here. I'm glad I graduate because although I am for black progress and equality, a lot of people at WashU simply took it way too far. I would elaborate, but someone would find a way to "prove me wrong" or "explain" how things were taken too far.

After graduation, I'm happy to see that the activism-for-attention pretty much stops. No, I'm not discrediting real activism, but it would be ignorant to say there are no people at WashU who are claiming certain things concerning their race for attention.

After current students' graduations, it will be interesting to see who continues on their protests, anger, and comments, and who simply stops and will be quiet because they are "too busy" or realize that the area they are in and their coworkers in the job actually aren't racist, even though strong racism continues elsewhere. I'm not saying this as a challenge or question, but just a true rhetorical query that I will be looking out for.

To those commenting against this negatively, go right ahead. Though I am curious if you decide to comment differently once you realize I'm black too.
