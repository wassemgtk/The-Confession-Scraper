I like getting my homework done ahead of time, but it's hard when I know none of my classmates are doing the same - if I need help I need to wait until the last minute to work together with people on it, and it seems like no one has down time when I do because they're all frantically rushing. It's like if I want to socialize with people I have to put off my work and be more stressed later to do that
