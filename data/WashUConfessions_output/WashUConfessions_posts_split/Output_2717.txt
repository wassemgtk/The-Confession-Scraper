I've been seeing someone on campus. He refers to us as "hooking up", but he'll sit with me, comfort me, hold my hand, and kiss my forehead. But when I bring up the idea of dating, he isn't interested. I feel like I have to make the sex good, and figure out how to make it good, to keep him. He makes me happy, makes me feel secure. But all I want is a companion, someone who doesn't mind acknowledging me in public, sitting and holding my hand in the view of others. I don't know if he'll ever want to keep me though.
