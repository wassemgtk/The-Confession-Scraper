e you missed it:

I realize I hadn't posted confessions in over two months and had never formally retired the page. I do apologize for suddenly not posting anymore.

There's a lot I have to say about the things I've seen while running Wash U Confessions, but I think the article does a good job of summing it up. I posted a more in-depth status on my personal Facebook page.

After the article came out, I just didn't want to check submissions anymore. It had been a while since I could go a day without having to read suicidal letters, political rants and threats. And honestly, I've been much happier since I've stopped posting. 

But I do owe it to the Wash U Confessions community to not drop off the face of the Earth like that. 

I'll start posting again tomorrow morning, and will be posting until the semester ends. Sorry again for not having posted for two months. I really just needed a mental break.
