Up to this day I still think that there are huge accent discrimination here but no one admits to that. While being Black might bring problem when people just look at you, having a foreign accent will bring a lot more subtle and unconscious discriminations even in justice-aware environments like here. And apparently no one cares. Even for groups which explicitly want diversity discrimination still happens. Asian American cannot represent Asian international students. Same for other racial groups. People make so many condescending remarks that they don't even realize sounds bad. I guess most of us would not approve saying something like "This is really good work for a female" or "this is awesome work for a black student", but why are people saying things like that to international students EVERY SINGLE DAY and think that it's praise and we should smile and say "thank you" and think we are crazy when we are angry at such statements?
