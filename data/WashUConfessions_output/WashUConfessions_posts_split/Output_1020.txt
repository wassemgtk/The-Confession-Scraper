Do you ever wish you could have a talk with your ex, not in an awkward getting them back way, but just to get feedback on what you were like to date, constructive criticism, a post-mortem of sorts? I guess it's kinda weird, but I feel like they'd know best about the problems that drove you two apart, so maybe you could avoid them in the future? Too bad my ex won't talk to me anymore.
