Dear 1090,
While I agree with what you are trying to say and am incredibly sympathetic for any discrimination you have received, it shocks me that you would say something "[fat girls] are more worth your time." You are sort of contradicting yourself by stereotyping while criticizing others who stereotype. We're all beautiful and we all deserve love! Sorry to call you out, I just see this happening all the time and I've always wanted to say something about it. Side note: That Louie video is amazing and Louis C.K. is one of the most underrated geniuses ever.
