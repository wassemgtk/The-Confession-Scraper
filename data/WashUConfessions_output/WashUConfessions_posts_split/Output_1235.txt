my profs are very accommodating with my health problems and i'm so grateful to go to a school where i can get help. but it makes me feel guilty when i happen to have a good health day because i worry that they see that and think that the extension or whatever i asked for yesterday was me exploiting the disability accommodations that i have.  when i use accommodations, i feel guilty for needing the extra help.  when I'm feeling healthy enough not to need them, i feel guilty too
