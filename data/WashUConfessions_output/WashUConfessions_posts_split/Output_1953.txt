I hate how all we see on here are people bashing Wash U. I don't want to minimize your complaints, or say that it's perfect, or anything like that because it's not. I agree with posts talking about how mental health and lack of socioeconomic diversity on campus are issues. However, I can't think of a place I would rather be than Wash U. I guess I'm just a freshman, and maybe am oblivious or ignorant to the greater issues at hand, but I can honestly say I had a great semester. I loved my professors, and learned more than I ever thought was possible. I have met so many great people who challenge me every day, and I feel a great sense of community here. Of course Wash U has so much room for improvement, and nobody should stop fighting for that, but I just think we don't give it the credit it deserves. I'm not trying to start anything argument here... just wanted to show some appreciation for what I personally feel is a pretty great place overall, and a place that has begun to feel like home to me.
