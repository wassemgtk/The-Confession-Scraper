I confess that I may have gotten 2 C's (3 total now) within my major and a fail this semester, so I don't know how grad school admissions will go now. Though I've dealt with anxiety and stress all semester, I do realize this is definitely my fault and I can improve next semester. But I can't help but distress about the fact that the damage is already done.

I also haven't gotten into research at all in my field, and I see other freshmen and sophomores already working in labs. How is this even possible before any of the large intro courses are over?
