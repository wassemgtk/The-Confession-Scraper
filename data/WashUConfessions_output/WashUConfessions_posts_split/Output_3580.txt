I'm still proud to be a WashU student. I've met a lot of amazing people here from a wide range of backgrounds and cultures. I'm disappointed by the actions of the kids who were involved in this, but I don't think they represent the student body as a whole and I'm encouraged by the outrage that the rest of campus has expressed. I've found WashU as a whole to be very welcome to everybody, and I hope a few bad eggs who attract all the attention and media don't give people the impression that we stand for something different than we do.
