I totally regret rushing the fraternity I am in. Although it's one of those frats that doesn't have a house, I thought there would still be a really tight brotherhood. Nope. Everything is about fulfilling a requirement, and I feel like most of the members are only there to add to their resume. It's not fun, and it's way too big to have any meaningful relationships. I wish I had rushed a real fraternity, but i'm an upperclassman and it's probably too late for me.
