I looked at the door to my room this morning, and I found a message written from a person who lived in my room last year. It said, "I used to live here" and "You don't know the things I've done here". I was so creeped out that I told my RCD and they're looking at the security footage.

I'm sorry to the person who did this, my actions were probably a little rash. I hope the consequences aren't too severe.
