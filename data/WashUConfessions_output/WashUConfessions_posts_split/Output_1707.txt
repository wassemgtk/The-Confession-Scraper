I have an absolutely amazing girlfriend and I love to do little things for her such as baking cookies to surprise her or writing cute notes for her to find. I must confess however, that what I really want is for her to do something like that for me sometime. I know it seems selfish but I really enjoy doing those things for her and wouldn't mind her doing that for me sometime
