I am so depressed, but I have been way too sacred to see anyone and get treatment. Because of all the campus activism about mental health, I finally gathered the courage to go make an appointment at SHS! I just wanted to say thank you to all the students who have been active about mental health week and have helped people like me gather the courage to confront this issue!
