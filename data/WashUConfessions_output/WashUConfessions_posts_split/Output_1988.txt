I was one of the Dec. grads walking out of Graham Chapel to only the sight of protestors, some of which were people I thought were my friends. While I don't deny for a moment the importance of your protesting efforts, I have to say it is rather disrepectful to your fellow classmates to have your protest during what is supposed to be a time of celebration for them. Are you now also planning on protesting during the May Commencement? Convocation for next year's freshman class? Or everyday in Olin library during finals week?
