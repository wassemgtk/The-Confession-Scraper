If Wash U switched their alcohol (huge tolerance) and marijuana (zero to litle tolerance) policies, I think 3 things would happen.
 1) EST would get a lot less calls.  maybe one or two for people who were freaking out a bit but you can just put on adventure time and they'll be good (much better than vomit all over those nice EST people).
2)  BD dining service money would shoot through the roof.  BD would make so much freaking money they would prob be able to invest some of that into another scholarship or something.  Or maybe even lower their exorbitantly high prices....
3) Our student populace might actually be a lot happier and nicer.  I know i'm both when I'm high.  Also it'd be SUPER progressive ya know? and Wash U should be progressing right instead of staying flagnant and the same.

ALSO its kinda douchey to say its relatively ok and we'll put a blind eye to underage intoxciation which can cause crazy damage to your kidneys and make you more likely to do stupid shit and then be like "weed is bad for you and illegal mmmmk?" when it's not and helps glaucoma and cancer.   It's super dumb and we're supposed to be smart people.  Either you make a blanket alcohol and soft drug policy or you're zero tolerance on everything.  Anything else is just hypocritical
