I'm in a relationship with a girl I really care for. I consider myself straight, but one night I hooked up with a guy off of craiglist to experiment and see what it was like. I did not like it, and this encounter has actually made me more concrete in my sexual identity. However, the fact that I cheated on this girl is eating me up inside. Should I tell her what happened or just try to forget it? I feel like the relationship would end if I told her. Maybe honesty in this case is not the best policy.
