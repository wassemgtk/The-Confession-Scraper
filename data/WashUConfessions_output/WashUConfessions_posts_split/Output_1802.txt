I've been dating my boyfriend for a while now and while I love his fraternity and the brothers in it, I can't help but notice that the environment perpetuates this idea that being in a relationship is "lame" or "uncool". I feel like he's constantly fighting a battle between being cool in the eyes of his brothers or having a girlfriend. It's like the only way to be fully accepted is to hook up with tons of girls and brag about it. And if you're in a relationship, you're probably whipped and you're not fun anymore. This isn't meant to hate on fraternities; I have lots of close friends in them but I just wish it wasn't so looked down upon to be in a relationship with someone you truly care about.
