Whenever I talk to my parents (everyday since last I got here last year) they always say they miss me and want me to come back home. Secretly, I love living at WashU so much more than being at home. It just makes me realize how much freedom I have with my life, and I appreciate the control I have over it. I mean, yes, I miss my family, but i'm living up dat college lyfe yo.
