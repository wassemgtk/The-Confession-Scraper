I confess that I googled my girlfriend's home address in California out of boredom. According to Zillow, it's worth over $2M. That's crazy and I'm kind of in shock because she never showed any signs of being that well-off. We've been dating for about 3 months and I really like her, but I'm considering breaking up with her because I don't think I'll ever be able to provide for her to those standards :(
