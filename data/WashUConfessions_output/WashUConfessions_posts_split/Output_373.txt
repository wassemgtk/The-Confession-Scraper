As someone who's been here for 3 years and has never heard someone say b-school pre-school unless they were either complaining about or discussing that idea, the only times I've ever really heard any "business school is easier" sentiment really expressed was in relation to homework. From the people that I know in the business school (some of whom boast about how they only have 2hrs of homework/night except for when case comp rolls around) it appears to be generally true that there's not as much to do out of class.
