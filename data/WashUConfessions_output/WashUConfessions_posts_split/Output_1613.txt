"The Six" by Black Anthology was not meant to be racist or offensive, but if a large group of people take offense, then those feelings should be addressed, regardless of who the feeling is coming from. Downplaying the discrimination people experience is the reason why systematic racism and prejudice still exists. I am not speaking on behalf of anyone, I am just one person who is trying to make sure I understand where both sides are coming from, and I think everyone should. So post your  confessions, let your grievances be heard- what EXACTLY in the play hurt or offended you? In which ways did BA portray white people as racists? What does racism men to you? Which parts of the play felt like a personal attack? Time and time again we have said that this or that may not be the "ideal" place to discuss this but I honestly think it should be wherever you feel comfortable speaking, or like your voice will be heard. Don't attack, discuss. If you must attack, defend your reason. I just want to know.
