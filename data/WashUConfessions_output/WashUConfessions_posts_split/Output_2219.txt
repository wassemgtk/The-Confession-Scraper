After a couple months of changing doses and medications my psychiatrist finally found the perfect medication and dose for my SSRI. I feel like I'm on top of the world. I feel like the person I was before all of this shit happened. I just want to tell everyone how happy I'm right now!!

I just want to thank the people on here for putting up with the depression posts- people like us sometimes don't have a support network other than our therapists and it feels good at times to vent out problems that we feel. Thanks for listening/caring about one of my posts a while back it does mean a lot.
