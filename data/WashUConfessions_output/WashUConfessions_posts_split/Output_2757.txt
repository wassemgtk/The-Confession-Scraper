I feel like people have forgotten why we came here. 'having fun' is not why you came here. If you wanted fun, you should've gone to Arizona State or Syracuse. I came here to become the best at what I do, and the way to achieve that is studying my ass off. Is it fun? Not always. Sometimes it downright sucks. I simply remind myself that I am doing for 4 or 5 years what others won't so that I can live for the rest of my life as others can't. Suck it up, we didn't come here to have fun.
