I'm sick of people trashing the fraternities. When I didn't get a bid from a frat, it caused me to relapse on my Depression; yet, I'm not bitter. Greek life is a good thing for the community, whether you like it or not, because it gets people involved in something bigger than themselves. Fellow GDIs, get over yourselves. I'm jealous of people in Greek life, but at least I'm man enough to admit it.
