Tonight I prostituted myself, except it went badly and the person did not pay after it was over. I wasn't physically attracted to him and he was much older than me. I feel really terrible and guilty about what I did/tried to do. I wish I didn't need the money, but I'm struggling so much financially and I thought it would be a way to help. I am too ashamed to tell anyone about this experience, so I figured I'd put it on here.

I don't need people shaming me - I'm already shaming myself a ton for what happened. I just needed to get this off my chest.
