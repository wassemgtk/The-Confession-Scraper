This is not really a confession but more of a question: has anyone ever dealt with Tamara King (Judicial Administrator)? She's adjudicating a case of academic misconduct in which I am involved in, and I am terrified that her punishment for me will be very severe. I understand I am in the wrong here, but I would just like to know whether she is very tough on her sanctions or is she willing to be open and listen to my side of the story?
