I confess that I am disgusted by the "hater" culture on campus. People say they're open and accepting, but the second someone has a controversial, usually non-leftist opinion, they switch to saying, "Keep your opinion to yourself, nobody wants it here" or "You're just racist/sexist/homophobic/ableist/misogynistic." or "Stop being a hater." I've also noticed this passive aggressiveness about it, saying "Thanks" after they give their opinion, as if it is law, or posting a smiley face with a really nasty reply.

We should be accepting of all ideas and open to listening to those with different ones. Many of us grew up in liberal homes, but some of us also came from extremely conservative ones. So far, on campus, the only people I've seen allowed to express their opinions without ridicule are the former. As someone whose parents actually were racist/homophobic/sexist, I would like to try to understand different groups of people, but I really don't want to associate with the people who are oppressing me into not sharing my background/beliefs unless I've made a conversion and completely denounce my past.
