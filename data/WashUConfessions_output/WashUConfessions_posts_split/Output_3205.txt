To all those people judging Washu based on this page, think of it this way these comments/opinions are obviously not popular opinions or they wouldn't be "confessions." If the majority of people were unhappy or disappointed with the social scene a confession would be "I went to a really great party last night" or "I actually really like the nightlife here." Posters wouldn't need to be anonymous if they felt comfortable expressing these opinions. And also they shouldn't be criticized for sharing negative opinions of Washu. People need a way to express their feelings, and if this is the only way they can then let them. Everybody needs something/someone to turn to.
