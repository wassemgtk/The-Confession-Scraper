My roommate always interferes my sentences, MANY TIMES. Before i finish my first sentence she just spills something totally about her which is totally irrelevent; even if i try to restart my sentences again after she finishes, she will do that again!! It is really disrespectful. I talked to her about it twice, she said she was sorry but never changes.
