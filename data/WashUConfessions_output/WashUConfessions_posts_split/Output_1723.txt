I was recently diagnosed with HIV, which I likely contracted from someone else on campus. I know exactly who this person is and I've contacted them already. They were one of the only two people I've ever had unprotected sex with. I've been looking into psychology therapy to mitigate the insane amount of anxiety I'm getting from realizing that I'll have to live with this disease for the rest of my life. My life could be cut shorter by several decades and I'll have to implement a new style to address my disease. I'm also getting prescription drugs to reduce the chances of me contracting this disease to others. I have no clue how to confront my parents about this. I was bewildered that an STD like HIV could easily be found on campus. On the other hand, I should've known better with all the education I've received on safe practices throughout my life. I'm a living, breathing warning of "told-you-so" and I'm still trying to come to terms with it. Please take my warning into account - one instance of unprotected sex could permanently change your outlook on the rest of your life.
