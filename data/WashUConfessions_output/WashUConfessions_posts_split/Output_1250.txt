My boyfriend and I are graduating and we may have to do long distance. We've been dating for 4 years and have never been apart for more than the summer. We live together now. I'm terrified about how this will change our relationship and what the future holds. I don't want to not come home to him every day. However, I also realize that if the best job for him is in another state, then he should take that to better his career. I'm just so scared and I know I'd miss him so much.
