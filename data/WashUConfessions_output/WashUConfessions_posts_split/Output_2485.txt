I confess that much of the time, I hate all of you. I hate you because you can make friends. I hate you because you do well in class. I hate you because you have a significant other. I hate you because you can speak in public without making it obvious that you're scared shitless to do so. And finally, I hate you for doing all of these things (and more) with little apparent effort, when for me sometimes just working up the courage to speak to someone takes so much effort and causes so much strain it isn't worth it.
