Wow. A top care worker said "Hey girl" not sure if this is even an issue. He's a human not a man beast. If a student had said this it wouldn't have been a problem. I am not saying cat-calling is okay (its very unflattering and can make people feel uncomfortable) but overall had a student did this it wouldn't have been given a second thought. Quite frankly, NO ONE should be catcalling because its degrading and immature.

I bring this issue up because until recently top care workers were instructed not to talk to students at all. Like they are lesser or do not have the grace by which to be amongst us. They are human. Just because they shovel dirt doesn't make them dirt.

They make this campus beautiful so instead of scurrying by in the mornings or afternoons, why not say a quick "good morning" or "afternoon" or "how are you doing?" treat them how you would treat your professors; be a decent human being don't just ignore them.

---If anyone calls you a derogatory term you should report it! We should all feel safe walking on this campus.
