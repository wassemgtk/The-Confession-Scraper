As a white male, here is my perspective on the whole “privilege” thing. Although I’m aware that white people have privilege in many aspects of life, there is one area in which non-white people have markedly more privilege: the ability to talk about privilege. Often, I feel that because I am white and male, anything I have to say on the issue will be dismissed with “you will never know how it feels be __________” or “you just don’t get it.” Sure, I’ll never know how it feels to be black or Asian or Hispanic or female or gay. And no one else will ever feel exactly how it feels to be me, or anyone else. But if white straight guys are a part of the problem, at least allow us to participate in the dialogue without shutting us down. Everyone’s perspective deserves to be heard. Telling us we “don’t know what it’s like,” and that we therefore can’t even join in the conversation, is much more isolating than productive.
