I confess that I feel overloaded with homework and exams and final projects and clubs and trying to have a social life, and I don't know how to handle it all. My grades are unsatisfactory but I'm studying my hardest and doing my best. I feel like I have no friends and I'm freaking out about who I'm going to live with next year. I'm just really anxious and having a tough time, and it seems like everyone else has their shit together but me.
