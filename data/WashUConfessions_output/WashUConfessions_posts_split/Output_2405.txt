I overheard someone the other day talking about going to the birthday party of someone who posted here a while back. I know a lot of people respond to messages saying "feel free to talk to me" and stuff, but I feel it's like a whole other level of awesome to take the time out of your (no doubt very busy) weekend to make someone's birthday feel special. Whoever it was who followed through on that, good on you. You're the kind of people every good person deserves in their lives.
