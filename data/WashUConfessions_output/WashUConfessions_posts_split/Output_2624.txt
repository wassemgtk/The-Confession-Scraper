I confess that if a girl is withholding sex I won't keep seeing her.  Sex is for our mutual benefit, not something I have to earn.  I'm a feminist.  If you think physical chemistry is unimportant, you're wrong.  You can stick to your parents' bullshit Protestant beliefs all you want but don't expect to have them respected in a progressive, educated culture.  A girl that fucks a guy the first night is smart and curious, don't listen to the ignorant slut-shaming you hear all over campus.
