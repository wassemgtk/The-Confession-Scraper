it pisses me off when people complain about SHS. These people are doctors with their medical degrees. Half of you are gonna be doctors someday and may just be working in a college infirmary too. Coming from someone who has had tons of medical problem (also im bschool btw--not some administrator, shs doctor, or have any relationship to an shs doctor) theyve been a big help. So for those of you who cite their complaints as being "i went to them with food poisoning and they told me to drink water" well there's not much else you couldve done. And for those of you who go to shs because you have a cold- you deserve to be told just to sleep it off. And dont complain that they didnt detect your sinus infection or couldnt figure out what was wrong with your throat. Odds are, if they couldnt find it, your doctor at home wouldnt have been able to either and you wouldve had to go to some specialist anyway. Moral of my rant-- get your facts straight before you complain about someone and potentially put their job in jeopardy- as well as the health of those who are too afraid to trust shs because of your complaints.
