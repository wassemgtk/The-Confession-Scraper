After reading all the confessions about relationships, I feel better about my life. My true love is my GPA and the thought of going to med school and man I'm going to stay a virgin until I finish my residency.  I do want a romantic life though and I expect it to turn out like Steve Carrel's romantic life in 40 Year Old Virgin. (Except for me it will be more like 30 year old virgin).
