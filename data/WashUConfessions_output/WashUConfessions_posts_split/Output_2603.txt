The day before I left for the airport, I came out of the closet to my best friend. He told me that my homosexuality really changed nothing - I was still the same quirky bastard he knew and loved (as a friend, duh). During orientation, I contemplated outing myself on day one. But instead of making a grandiose "coming out" announcement with a megaphone in hand, I brought only radio silence. By default, I became just another straight man on the floor. Sometimes, I wish I had a "gay lisp" just so people would be more like "he's obviously gay" - that'd make life so much easier for me. I've already developed some good friendships and I'm afraid they'll all evaporate into smoke if people jump-the-gun. Because, of course, gay men want to tear the pants off of every guy they meet (if this were a heteronormative situation, this assumption would sound borderline rapist, wouldn't it?). Well, I could have taken a hella load off my chest with the nice clean slate I got. But now, I've really fucked up. My roommate consistently makes homophobic remarks to my face and I feel too insecure to stand up for myself and the LGBT community. I feel so lost and aimless.
