I am a sophomore in college and today I found out that I am a father. Yes, you read that correctly, a father. My daughter was born today, her name is Sarah and she weighs 6 pounds, 3 ounces. Her mother, a girl I met at a party nearly 11 months ago back home, called me today to tell me the news. She called me, told me the baby was mine, and that she was going to attempt to raise it. A baby. MY baby. I can't believe this news and I'm struggling to comprehend what has happened to me. I am just a sophomore in college. I drink 4 nights a week and I'm irresponsible as shit. I hook up with random girls and I never talk to them again. I'm failing 3 of my classes and I'm already on probation with the school. I have no idea what I am doing with my life, and I think I might be an alcoholic/ addicted to other drugs. And today, I found out that I'm a fucking father. My daughter, my own flesh and blood, was born today, and I am in absolutely no state to be able to take care of her or support her mother. I don't know what to do, this news has changed the entire course of my life. I need help, I can't deal with this.
