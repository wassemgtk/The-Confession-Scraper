I'm bothered by the number of people using our WashU class pages to find a taxi partner for two main reasons: I get that you might be carrying some bags, but is it really that hard to take the Metro? WashU gives us free passes (so many students at other schools would be jealous) and the ride only takes twenty minutes. Think of how wasteful and bad for the environment it is to have hundreds of cabs driving people from the airport. Secondly, 1700 other people don't care about you arriving at the airport. While there isn't a dedicated page (yet)  for this purpose, it is very irritating to keep seeing and getting notifications for something that does not concern the whole class.  Just man/woman up, and take the Metrolink for its designed purpose.  As a side note, WashU went out of its way with community and financial support to have two Metrolink stations on campus during its construction; don't let that go to waste.
