Can we all just admit that Bidets are great and cut the toilet-paper crap?  Seriously.  How are we ok with shoving our hands up our newly-shit-stained-asses when there is a device that can do 80% of the cleaning process for you?  I confess that I die a little inside when I reach for toilet paper and remember that Europe is doing this better.
