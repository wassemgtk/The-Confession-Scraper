I'm still trying to figure out Tinder.  I am basically on there for sex, but it's kind of hard to strike the line between direct and creepy with no face to face communication. I know a lot of people are on it for other reasons (more power to them) so I feel kind of shit about directly hitting on someone who is just looking for people to date or in some cases talk to. Especially when I have mutual friends with so many of my matches.
