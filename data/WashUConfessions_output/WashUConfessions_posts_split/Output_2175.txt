I have so many feelings about WashU. I love the people I've met here dearly. There are incredibly amazing, inspiring, knowledgeable people here. I have met my best friends here. I hate the administration though. WashU is part of a community, a city, a nation, and a world that is working through deeply rooted issues and systems of oppression, and yet we do so little. Every action I see from the administration and if I'm honest the student body and myself is to improve an image. We never reach the heart of the issues.

But mostly, I feel thankful to WashU. Because of the incredible, inspiring staff, students, and faculty I have met in my time here (I have so much love for you guys), I am who I am today. Yes, who I am today is not who I ultimately want to be. I have a hell of a long way to go before I reach that point. But I do know that WashU has placed me on the path I want to follow and I don't know if I would have found this path if I wasn't here.
