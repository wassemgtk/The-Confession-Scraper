Every Friday I wake up and think this week I won't have sex with some random guy but every week I let myself down. In the few weeks that I've been here at Wash U, I have had sex with over 25 different guys. Last week I even slept with a 30 year old guy I met at a bar. And this is after coming from a high school where I had sex with just one guy. Every day I think I won't but come the weekend with a little or a lot of alcohol inside me I end up going back with someone to their room. Many of the guys were so unfazed by my willingness to fuck them that they weren't even prepared and didn't have condoms, but that didn't stop me. Best part is I have a boyfriend who does not know about any of this. He doesn't go here but he assumes that when I party all I do is drink, and him finding out is something I fear more than getting an STD because I really love him. I don't know why I'm like this and what to do. I can't seem to stop.
