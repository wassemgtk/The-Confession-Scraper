I confess that I wish I had a less noticeable appearance. I would be perfectly happy being completely ignored, but everytime I go outside, people always discuss how attractive they find me. Every single time, despite what I'm wearing or doing. Frankly, it makes me so uncomfortable and I would much rather be invisible. I know many people wish for this attention and I should be grateful, but it is sincerely becoming a hinderance. I would trade my looks for a better brain in a heartbeat.
