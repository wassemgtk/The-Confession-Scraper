Last night, I dreamt that there was a protest made up of WashU students outside of Walgreens. They were protesting the use of chemical weapons in Syria and demanding US military intervention. Kit Mao then proceeded to walk out of Walgreens in full lab gear, holding a test tube in each hand, when she spotted the protest and there was a slight misunderstanding. She came charging at the students screaming "NO NO NO CHEMICALS ARE GOOD! I LIKE CHEMICALS! YOU LIKE CHEMICALS! YOU ALL GET Fs IN CHEM LAB". Then the entire protest dispersed in a cloud of confusion. I think the most unrealistic part of this dream, though, was the idea of people protesting in favor of Syrian military intervention.
