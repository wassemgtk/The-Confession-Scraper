I go to every different campus eatery I pass on my way back from campus everyday and get something. I figure if I get just one or two things from each place, no one will notice how much I eat and judge me for it. Only when I'm back in my room surrounded by all my trash and the malingering smells of pizza, caesar dressing, stir-fry, ramen noodles and ice cream do I regret my choices. I somehow manage to forget that feeling while I'm in my post-gorging food coma and I do it again the next day.
