I lost my ID in Olin on Wednesday 10/1 around 11:00 am. After looking for it for about 40 minutes, I finally decided to go to the front desk to see if it turned up, and lo and behold, there it was! Whoever returned my ID, thank you so much. Everyday that I'm here (I'm a freshman), I love this school more and more :)
