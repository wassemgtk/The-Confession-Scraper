I have learning differences and sometimes feel like less in comparison to my peers. I get extra time on exams and go to my professors' office hours when I am confused but I just hate how it takes me twice as long to understand things as my classmates. I'm hesistant to share my learning differences with others because I don't want to be seen as "slow" or not as smart. I'm tired of hearing people talk about how they can get an A on a test without studying whereas I need to study in order to get a decent grade on a test, or even just pass a test. I'm just frustrated.
