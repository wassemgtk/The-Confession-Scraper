I applied early to WashU. When I found out I got in I was ecstatic, because I knew, or at least thought I knew, that it was where I wanted to spend the next chapter of my life at. I hated high school, and every passing day of senior year just brought me one day closer to coming to WashU.
I've been here a little over a month now, and while the first two weeks were incredible, the past few have been miserable. I feel so alone, and I know that it was probably my fault for being so shy at first. Now I'm trying to talk to people on my floor, but it seems like they have already made all the friends that they wanted.
I just can't stand it here, so far at least. I know that my problem isn't necessarily specific to WashU itself, and that I would probably feel this way at any college, but I've been so unhappy lately and I have nobody here that I can really trust and talk to.
I just want to go home and be with my family and friends.
