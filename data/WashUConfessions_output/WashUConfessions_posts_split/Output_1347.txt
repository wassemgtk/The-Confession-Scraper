I'm going to be graduating in May, and it feels strange. But I just wanted to get this out there...

My graduation represents what I have achieved and all of the work that I have put in. But it's not just about me. I come from an income bracket that does not qualify me for financial support, and my parents have worked incredibly hard for years in order to have enough saved to put me through college. They've sacrificed so much for the sake of my education and that of my siblings. They've also been an emotional and spiritual anchor for me during hard times. I owe them so much. My graduation is just as much their victory as it is mine.

I know that I am incredibly lucky to have such loving and supportive parents. I just wanted to encourage everyone to call your parents today, right now, and tell them that you love them. It means the world to them to hear that they are appreciated, and I know my parents don't really hear it enough from me.
