I first want to say that I did not see Black Anthology, and therefore cannot comment on exactly what was said as part of the play, only what I have heard about it from friends who went and posts on anonymous pages such as this one.  However, as is obvious by such posts, there are a number of white students who felt offended and/or alienated by the way they were portrayed.  The argument has been made, in an effort to justify this sentiment, that African American students often feel isolated as well.

Wouldn't it be better to make an effort to reduce the isolation felt by African American students rather than to justify the alienation of students from other backgrounds as well?  Yes, talking about racism and prejudice can be uncomfortable, and yes, the dialogue needs to happen.  But an eye for an eye isn't going to work here.  Can't we improve the situation of one group of students without putting down another?
