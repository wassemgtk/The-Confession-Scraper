I confess that I am SO NOT OKAY with the way in which WUSTL releases crime reports. Unfortunately, WashU students sexually assault and steal from one another. I wonder how often WashU students are victims of crimes committed by the black community members we read about in these reports versus those committed by other students. I have a feeling these crime reports do not give an accurate representation of what happens to WashU students. WUSTL community members can learn little more from reading these emails other than to fear St. Louis, watch out for people of color, and, in the case of this one, avoid public transportation. All of these "lessons" are problematic, to say the least.
