I don't want to make this an anti-ungulate post or generalize here, but I have to say that I've come to realize that there is a significant percentage of ungulates who are pigs. Three situations happened in the last week alone.

First, I was walking past a farm when an ungulate came to the fence. The animal then started to squeal and oink at me, it was offensive to be objectified and harassed like that. Turns out it was a fucking pig. Luckily I found out it was a pig in the nick of time before I committed to anything.

Second, at that same farm, I saw this beautiful horse standing in a meadow. The graceful animal then wandered over to a water/mud hole and began rolling around like a fucking pig -> further proof that ungulates are pigs!

Then, another time my friend saw this bull fornicating  with a cow in the field, and then the very same day it was committing the same sin (before marriage no less), with a completely different cow. What a fucking PIG!

Thank god me and my friends were able to realize what these animals were before anything more serious happened or we got hurt. But all of these creatures acting like animals, chasing physical pleasure though at what cost. I have some serious trust issues now, everything looks like a pig to me.
