After three semesters at WashU, I'm finally on Dean's list. I'm really happy even though my GPA is still nowhere good enough as a pre-med. Because next semester, I can aim higher, and get better. To all the pre-meds out there: if you truly want to be a doctor, don't let your GPA stop you. Make small improvements, one step at a time. Just because your GPA started off low, doesn't mean it will stay that way. Not having everything going perfectly and learning to improve makes you a stronger person. Keep going!
