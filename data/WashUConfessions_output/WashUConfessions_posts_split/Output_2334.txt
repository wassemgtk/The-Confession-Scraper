I love this page and feel that the admin is awesome for putting the struggles of so many people out in the open. That being said, I can only hope that compassion fatigue doesn't set in on the WashU community because of the plethora of posts on this page. The tendency to stop caring is natural, but I urge people to recognize and resist it.
