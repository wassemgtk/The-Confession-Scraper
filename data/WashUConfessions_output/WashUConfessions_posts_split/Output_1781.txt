I confess that I've been swiping right on tinder for all of the guys that I went to high school with just to see which ones thought I was attractive. When it's a match, I undo it immediately. It's a pretty rude thing to do. That said, I have concluded that I missed out on SO many opportunities back then. Maybe I wasn't as much of a dork as I thought I was.
