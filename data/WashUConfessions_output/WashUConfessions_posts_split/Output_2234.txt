One night a few weeks ago I accidentally got black out drunk and discovered the next morning that I had gone home with a random guy from a bar. In fact, the next morning, when I woke up, I was still  so drunk that I was still fading in and out of awareness. Somehow or another I ended up walking home with not my jacket on, but one of the guy's long sleeve shirts. Truth be told, I don't remember this guy's name and really even what he looked like, but I kept the shirt because it smells so dam good...
