It makes me sad that so many people are missing out on all of the great things Wash U has to offer because they suffer from depression. Depression is real, and it can be incapacitating- I witnessed my best friend struggle for a year before he finally opened up about it to his friends. He was getting help from a counselor, but I started to see a real, positive change in him after he opened up. I know it's really hard to do, but it's also really hard for your friends to watch someone they care about suffer. As embarrassing as it might be to "come out" with your depression, it can be equally as difficult for your friends to blatantly ask you about it. So please, trust and confide in your friends. I promise, they will surprise you.
