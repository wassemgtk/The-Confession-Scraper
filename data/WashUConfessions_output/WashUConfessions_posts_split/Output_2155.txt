I confess that I am overweight - by "the size of average Wash U student" standard, probably not by the BMI standard. Last week when I was heading downstairs to get an omelet my boyfriend asked me to buy one for him too. And that is the most awkward, uncomfortable experience ever. I might be overthinking but it just feels like everyone is judging me, like "how dare this fat b***h dare eat two omelet shouldn't you be ashamed of that". There was a guy in the line before me who also ordered two omelet and I'm certain that the chef was less surprised when he ordered. Well it can be perfectly explained by guys generally eat more so it's always surprising when a girl eat as much as a guy do. Well I don't think people in the line mean to judge me that day (I might be wrong though)...but considering that after I've told my boyfriend I'd rather to stand in the line twice than ever order two serves of food again right away, I'm still taking time to write this confession a full week later, I'm really bothered by my thoughts.
