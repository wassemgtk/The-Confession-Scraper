My biggest pet peeve here is that everyone complains about people not knowing what/where/how good of a school WashU is. That shouldn't matter.  For the most part the people who need to know, know (I.e. companies hiring students, graduate schools, etc.) When people are complaining it is more of an ego problem than anything else.  This attitude sucks and people who do this really should try to get over themselves because newsflash: you're not intrinsically better than anyone else in this world, including people at colleges that "aren't as good as WashU."

Focus on whats important. Getting a good education, making great friends and memories, and learning life long lessons outside of the classroom that will help make this world a better place.
