I think i have some sort of ongoing mental health problem.  Thankfully, it's not too bad right now, but I kind of think i should go to see a counselor before anything gets worse.  I was wondering if someone could explain how SHS's quota of free counseling visits works.  Like, do the 8 free visits show up on your student billing account or insurance or anything?  Do you still get the free visits if you don't have Wash U healthcare plan?  Or just general advice/experience/recommendations about using SHS?  Any thoughts are appreciated, thanks.
