I am not reminded that I am not a frat guy when I am at one of their parties. I am not reminded I am not a frat guy when I see them at the gym bench pressing 3 of me. I am reminded that I am not a frat guy when I get in line at the village grill and the 3 frat guys in front of me have ordered 8 steaks and 10 eggs between them.
