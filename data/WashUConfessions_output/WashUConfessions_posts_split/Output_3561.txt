When old men gush about how attractive I am, a rare type of beauty, I wish WashU boys my own age would occasionally tell me the same. I'm not a fan of my ethnic-looking, not cute nose, so when a man recently honed in on my nose as a feature he said was perfect, I thought he was making fun of me. We talk about those we admire to friends often, but let's sometimes tell the person we admire directly. Someone's day will be made.
