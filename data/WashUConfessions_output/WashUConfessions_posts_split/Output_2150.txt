I don't know what it is about me, but a lot of people think I'm a virgin. Some people even think I've never kissed anyone. Even this girl I was seeing this summer thought I was a virgin. I wish I gave off a not-a-virgin vibe instead of giving off this virgin vibe. I don't want girls that I find attractive to think I'm a bad/clumsy lover. I'm not saying I'm the best. But I do know what I'm doing.
