Hi- I don't know if this is exactly the kind of stuff you would post on here but I think this is really important for people to know about (and I would rather stay anonymous.) There is a free STI screening  in DUC 232 on Friday from 12-3pm for the first 70 students who show up. It's a great, free way to get tested so I really hope people know that this is out there.
