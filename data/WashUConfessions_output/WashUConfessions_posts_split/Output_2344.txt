I really, really miss my old dog.
He was the one thing I thought about everyday coming home from high school. Most people don't even get how close I was to him, and that's fine, because he brought me too much joy and love to even care.
He's at a different home now, but I still think about him almost everyday and wish he was here with me to play and hug and just have. I'd take him over any friend here because he was my family.
Miss you, bro.
