I'll tell you all something I've never told anyone before. I'm only here because my dad donated a sht ton of money and my cousin got in because her dads an alum. I'm actually pretty dumb, and before college I actually thought I worked hard to get into this school. The vast majority of my friends are here because of legacies and donations as well. People are upset about affirmative action because it may be the reason why they didn't get in, but fail to see how one of the above scenarios probably limited the admissions offices decision more than anything. I'm white, I'm fairly well off and I recognize this privilege. Shame on whoever wrote the post about affirmative action being the reason why a black kid got in. Shame on you for being that ignorant.
