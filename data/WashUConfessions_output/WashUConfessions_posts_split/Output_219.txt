Two people in one of my premed classes are cheating. My teacher figured out who the individuals were, but has no concrete evidence to prove it (this is the simple version of the situation). This makes me so mad because everyone else has worked so hard for their grades, but these two dishonest individuals have completely disrespected the professor and the class. The classroom environment has turned into one of accusations and deceit. If you have to cheat to do well in a prerequisite premed class, I wouldn't want you to be my doctor. Why would I want a doctor who achieved his degree through dishonesty?
