I confess that whenever I see you, I still think of the day we first kissed, held hands, laid on the bed together and spent time doing nothing but listening to each other's breath and those memories all make me both happy and sad. But I know I've moved on because thinking of you doesn't hurt anymore. I haven't seen you much around now that we're not together anymore but hopefully you are doing well too. I wish you would be well enough to not blame yourself but not forget about me and from time to time, miss the times we spent together and those emotions we shared.
