I was born 100 years too late. I wish I could have lived the life of my great-grandparents and not ventured from the farm. I'm not much for cities, or modern society in general. My goal in life is to work damn hard so I can live in my own little isolated bubble somewhere in the midwest. I want to live like the Busch and many other old money families did and build my own private rural utopia. I won't have to care about "social justice" or whatever the buzzword of the month is; just wake up and wonder how the animals are doing. Am I the only one who would gladly return to the rural society from which we came?
