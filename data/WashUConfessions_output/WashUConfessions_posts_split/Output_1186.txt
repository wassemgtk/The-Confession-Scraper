It might just be me, but I feel like Overheard at Wash U has taken a turn for the worse quality wise.  It's pretty much devolved into a pulpit for people to advertise their events on campus and other random personal things.  LIke Overheard at Wash U should specifically be for the hilarious small tidbits people overhear or see while on campus.  There's the rest of facebook for everything  else.  We can do better guys.
