I confess that I'm not going to WILD for very logical reasons--Icona Pop is not my jam and standing in a crowd for hours is not my idea of fun. My relationship with music is a private thing I like to immerse myself in alone. Yet even though I feel like I am justified in not going, I feel this weird shame, like some sort of social outcast simply because I'm not going and the majority of my class is. Hmmm. It's quite strange. Fortunately, my roommate wasn't feeling it from WILD this year either and we're going to have a relaxing evening inside. At least I know I'm not alone in feeling this way.
