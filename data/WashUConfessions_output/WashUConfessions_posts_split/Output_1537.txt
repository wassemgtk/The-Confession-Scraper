Someone I'd consider a friend cheats in a lot of his classes. He copies labs from other people and never shows up to class. He's involved in a lot of things on campus but it's only possible because of his dishonest methods. I am really frustrated by the way he gets ahead and feel like my hard work is being devalued whenever he cheats to get a good grade. I don't know what to do, or if I should even do anything at all. Suggestions please?
