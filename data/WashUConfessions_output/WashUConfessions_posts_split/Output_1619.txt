So, I'm going to have to preface this confession with the admission that I did not go to Black Anthology. It sounded plenty interesting, but I had other commitments and couldn't make it... That said, none of what I'm about to say applies specifically to BA because I can't speak for it--all I know about it is from a couple of friends and YikYak.

However, I do feel that the little bit of arguing on YikYak prompted me to start thinking about the whole race issue, and I have words that I need to say about it.

Firstly, I do believe racism is still rampant in America, and I do believe that there are many situations in which blacks are mistreated because of unfounded stereotypes surrounding their race--however true or false these may be. Each person, regardless of their skin color, is exactly that: a person. Our actions should speak for who we are rather than our race. Not every black person is a thug, not every white person is a racist, not every Asian is a massive nerd, etc, etc. I could go on forever with that, but you get the point. Only those who act like thugs or act like racists are thugs and racists. The continued existence of these attitudes indicates, in my opinion at least, some undercurrent problem that plagues our country.

For the current moment, the overarching opinion is that the system, and in general the population, harbors innate racist tendencies. I'm not going to try to prove whether this is or isn't true--perhaps that is why we need to have dialogues and such, to figure out if racism is really the crux of the matter or if there is an even more fundamental, insidious issue that is causing this strife. I'm willing to listen to this dialogue, so long as it remains civil and, for lack of a better word, "intelligent" (that is, without devolving into a series of strawmen, ad hominem, and otherwise fallacious and unsupported arguments that rely on emotion rather than reason).

That said, however, I don't feel as though this kind of dialogue is what is happening. As a white male, I don't see any dialogue--at least, not any that is directed toward me and my people. For us, it's attacks and satire to point out the sins of ours forefathers, for which we now are apparently guilty--not as an individual, but as a whole, and it is this reasoning that completely defeats social equality before it really even ever has a chance to take off. I know my sins, as do many whites, but to sit there and pick them apart for us is not helpful. If anything, it pushes many of us away because, while our misdeeds are paraded for all to see, the faults of the minority communities are brushed under the rug. We're almost all guilty to some degree for preventing equality, whether it be for the direct mistreatment of others of others or for alienating those who need addressing. Just fixing the white folks' attitudes is not going to fix racism--it's got to be everyone. Yet, I don't see that... I legitimately feel that we are the target here. If there is a demand racial sensitivity for one group, there needs to be the same for all--including whites. Minorities are no better than us, and we are no better than minorities.

Now, of course, I've seen some people justify this by saying that this is the same pain that minorities, especially blacks, have felt in America for a long time, that it is justified because of the blood that stains others' hands. Yet, in my experience, this hasn't really ever done much to encourage many others to take up arms against racism and inequality. Perhaps it is my naivety speaking, but can't only light drive out darkness, or love drive out hate? It seems that too many people have forgotten MLK already. Exacting revenge isn't going to fix anything. If you fight fire with fire, then we will all burn.

I know I may have not perfectly described what I wanted to here, but it's any issue that I feel needs to be addressed. There's a lot of people, both that I know and that I don't, who have there heart in the right place, but to me, it seems that many of those fighting for equality--both minority and majority--have taken a route that *could* fix the issue, though at such a cost that I wonder who at all would benefit. We're all people. Why can't we act like it?
