Last year I was seeing a guy who may have been the most perfect person I've ever encountered. He made me happy, secure. He crutched to BD in the rain just to sit with me. I was afraid to tell him so many things - that my father was ill, but I couldn't go home. That I'm ill, and I won't ever get better. I clung to him, and predictably drove him away. Our mutual friends blame him, and I hate it. He was the kindest person in the world. I'm the one who drove him away. Even now, though I go out with other guys, he's the one I miss. Every time I see him, I lose my breath a little. We don't talk anymore, and I can't find any way to express how I feel. But if he wanted a second try, if he ever came back, I'd drop everything.
