At the beginning of this semester, I decided to challenge myself. Whenever I found myself wanting to say "that offends me," I started mentally rephrasing it to "I take offense at that."  And you know what? That small switch to taking responsibility forced me to think about why I was taking offense at things, clarified my views, and helped me to realize that if someone can offend you, they have power over you. It's probably been one of the most empowering decisions of my life.
