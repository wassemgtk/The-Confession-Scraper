I confess that I have relapsed into my eating disorder, and that I'm scared to let anyone know because Wash U is still new to me, and I don't really have any friends yet. I don't know where to go for help, or who will not judge me. This place makes me feel crazy and helpless.  I'm scared to tell some one, but I'm scared about what will happen if I don't.
