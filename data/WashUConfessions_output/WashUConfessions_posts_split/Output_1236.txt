I know this is a long confession but stick with me because it has 420 relevance.

When I was in HS, there was a bully.  He was specifically fond of my friend and I.  By fond I mean cruel.  So one day, after a particular round of cyber-bullying, my friend asked me to send photo's of his posts as evidence.

But because we were using his name so much, it was at the front of my mind and I mistakenly sent the pictures to the bully.

By complete luck, I got into the bully's email and corrected the mistake without him ever knowing I had emailed him at all.

But now every time I am gossiping about someone online, I get paranoid because I fear using their name so much, will cause me to message them by mistake.

I confess all of this because on this 420 day, my boss is out.  They chose last second to not come to work.  I thought about messaging a friend voicing my suspicions and then thought of accidentally sending that message to my boss.

It gave me such chills, the image of sending "I bet my boss is high as fuq right now" to my boss, that I felt compelled to confess.
