Tonight at our floor meeting my floor did an activity where we wrote anonymous notes to each other. I expected to receive a few from the friends that I had made, but I was genuinely surprised by the outpouring of love I received from the people I live with. Sometimes I feel alone and friendless, like many of the people who post here, but feeling all this love tonight really touched me and made me feel so much better about everything.

To all those feeling down about life or their social situations, know that there are probably people who admire and love you but just don't express it.
And to all those secret admirers, know that an expression of your love will make someone's day and can have more of an impact than you can imagine.
