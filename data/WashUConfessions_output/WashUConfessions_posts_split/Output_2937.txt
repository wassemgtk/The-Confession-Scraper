Dear Humanities Major (I'm looking at you confession #887), From one pre-med senior, congratulations for your amazing standardized test scores - they're impressive. I am glad you have the confidence to study what you love even when the comments from your peers get under your skin. To be honest, English isn't my strength so I truly admire your ability to excel in a field I would struggle just to pass. I took a few English classes here and trust me when I say I'm GLAD I'm not an English major (I couldn't handle it here). However, as a pre-med, I am offended by you claiming that you would have done fine as a pre-med, architect, scientist, or engineer without having gone through the entire process. You are clearly smart enough to pursue any of these fields. But, there's so much more to just being smart enough (you wouldn't have gotten into Wash U if you weren't). At least from my perspective, most pre-meds are constantly worrying about their future for almost 15 months (our applications are generally sent out in May/June during the junior year). Even if you make it through the first three years of being pre-med, Wash U can still refuse to write a committee letter, which means you're basically not getting into medical school. There's constant pressure to be better than everybody else in a cut-throat environment, antagonism from others (including professors who don't like pre-meds, classmates, etc), and the uncertainty of what you're going to do if you don't make the cut. I am not sure if there's something similar as a Humanities major. The point I'm trying to make is that I have no idea what it takes to be an English major here, so I do not take jabs at the field you have chosen. Now, I expect you to do the same for me. Don't insult what I have spent my life pursuing by claiming you'd be just fine in this field. There are plenty of others just as intelligent as you are who haven't made it to the end. - One ticked off pre-med scientist.
