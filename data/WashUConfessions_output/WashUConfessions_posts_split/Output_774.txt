When I was walking home a couple months ago, a girl in front of me started screaming at me for "following her like a fucking creep" and threatened to beat me up for "acting rapey".  As a gay guy, it really hurt to be generalized and demeaned this way.  I guess I have to start walking on eggshells to avoid this kind of confrontation in the future.
