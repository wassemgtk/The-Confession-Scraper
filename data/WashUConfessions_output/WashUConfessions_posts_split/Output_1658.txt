In response to those complaining about WashU's decision to increase tuition to around $47,000 for the next academic year, I'm am truly sorry about the financial and mental stress that this decision is inflicting upon you and your family. However, I'd like to point out that this increase in tuition shouldn't come as a surprise to you as it is consistent with WashU's trend over the years of increasing tuition by around 3.5 - 3.8 percent annually. This is also consistent with the average annual 3.7 percent tuition increase across all private schools in the nation. Additionally, the average increase in base salaries in the US over the last 4 years was 2.8 %, so this increase in tuition is in part used to fund the roughly 2.8% salary increase to those employed by WashU. The almost 1% (not very high) average rate of inflation (decrease in real value of money) over the last year is another reason why tuition rates cannot be constant. The increased tuition will also be used to fund the increasing admissions of students who are eligible for Federal Pell Grants. (Under the assumption that WashU sticks to its goal of increasing economic diversity in the school.)

I myself come from a family that struggles to pay tuition at WashU, but we expected these annual tuition hikes before I committed to attend the school simply because it is a known trend across every private school in the nation. I planned for these annual increases and I'm surprised as to how this increase could come as a shock to someone. Additionally, in response to those who are seeking financial assistance, it is not very difficult to obtain low interest student loans. As a WashU student, you should be able to find a job after graduation that will help you pay off these loans assuming you worked hard and took advantage of the opportunities at WashU.  Personally, I worked my ass off and landed internships that paid me $14k and $18k my sophomore and junior summers respectively, and I am fortunate to have been offered a job that will be paying me $70K post graduation.

This post is in no way intended to offend or upset anyone, and is merely my opinion, and I hope it provides some insight to those who were surprised by, or  found the increase in tuition "ridiculous".  The contents of this post may not apply to everyone, and are not directed at those in extreme or special circumstances. Please speak out if you disagree with me or any of the arguments in this post, and I'd be happy to learn from your perspective. Lastly, I want everyone to know that If I can do it, so can you! I wish all the happiness, success and luck to all those affected by the increasing tuition at WashU.
