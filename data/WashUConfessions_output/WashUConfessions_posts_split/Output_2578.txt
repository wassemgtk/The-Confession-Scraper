Since I left high school and came here, I felt a lot better. High school was objectively horrible, it's almost absolutely safe to say I was severely depressed (couldn't go to a doctor because every time my mom "offered"/threatened to take me, she was yelling at me for not doing something because I was sleeping instead), and I felt extremely isolated from my classmates and friends--generally unwanted.

I came here, and even though I had a hard time making friends, I felt so much better just getting away from high school. I thought it was fine if I still had bad days, but then they started becoming bad weeks, then bad months, and I just had to pretend like I was okay. My suitemates last year didn't help much; I felt like I was being judged continuously by them, and one didn't talk to me unless they needed something from me.

Now I'm crying in my room by myself because I was pretending like everything was okay while I was waiting for the other shoe to drop.
