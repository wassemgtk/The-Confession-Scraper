The fact that the culture here is strongly 'fat is bad'  really makes it hard for me to love this school as much as I want to. Eating disorders aside,  if you're skinny and say that you're fat, you're immediately assured that you're not. 'I feel fat for eating this' is perfectly acceptable for a skinny person to say, but if you are overweight, everyone just looks at you,  no matter if you've actually been eating healthily for x amount of time, or have been exercising regukarly.  Fuck fat shaming, and fuck not making me feel welcome here when I deserve it.
