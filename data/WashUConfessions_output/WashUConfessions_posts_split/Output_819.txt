I frequently complain about the glamorization of teenage pregnancy or girls having babies on accident when they and everyone else know they can't handle having the baby. Honestly though, I want a baby so badly I'd do just about anything. If I didn't feel like the WashU community wouldn't accept me for having a baby at 19, I'd already be married and at least be trying to get pregnant by now.
