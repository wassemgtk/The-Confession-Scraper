I confess that my eating disorder has gotten so bad that I've decided I need help, but I just dont have the courage to go to SHS because I've talked to Connie and other ED treatment team member before and they thought I know way beyond average on nutrition and can approach the subject from a scientific and objective way. I am also involved in some of the groups which promote healthy eating on campus. I'm not thinking I'm gonna disappoint someone or something by seeking help but I just can't let that image of me shatter to pieces.
