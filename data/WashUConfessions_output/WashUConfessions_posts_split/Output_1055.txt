Tonight (Sunday) I was walking in front of Brookings (it must have been around 9PM) and I saw a guy and a girl walking somewhere together. They were walking on that road that passes in front of Brookings, the one with no sidewalks, to get to Forsyth it looked like. Anyway, a car was driving up behind them, and it clearly saw them and wasn't going to hit them or anything, but the guy immediately held her shoulder and switched places with her so that he was standing on the inside of the road instead.

Although neither of them probably would have been harmed, he just instinctively did that and you could tell how much he cared for her. It just really made me smile and I thought I'd share. Idk, I love when guys do things like that -- it's the little things.
