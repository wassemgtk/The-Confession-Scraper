I confess that I feel like people judge me upon first sight at this campus. It's not because I'm a minority group, or my gender, or anything eccentric, it's because of my weight.

I have felt self-conscious getting food so many times on campus that I've lost track. I try to eat healthy and people are in complete shock that an overweight person even knows what spinach and kale are and if I eat unhealthily people think I'm gorging myself into oblivion. I even took it upon myself to try and work out at the AC and I felt like everyone there was either trying to not get caught looking at me or scoffing at me.

I honestly feel like I can't win and I already have fairly low self-confidence. On one hand I don't want to let the negativity get to me and on the other hand, it's hard not to.
