Hi so this is actually a response to confession 2099- I'd prefer to leave my name, chapter, and position out  of the post but I went through the same exact thing. I cried every day after bid day for a week because I honestly didn't feel good enough. I was once that girl and it took me too long to realize that you are in that chapter for a reason- because people saw something in you. And you may not see it in yourself yet, but I promise you will. It just takes some people longer than others.
