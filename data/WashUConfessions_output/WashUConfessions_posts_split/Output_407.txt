There's two parts, one is a confession one is a question for you, admin!

Confession:
I consistently struggle with wondering whether I deserve to be here, or whether I've gotten to a place like WashU because of factors outside of my control (my parents' ability to pay for my college, my upper middle class background, opportunities I was given that other people weren't given.) That doesn't mean I don't work hard, but I always wonder how much of my success is because of my hard work, but because of winning a genetic lottery. And it sucks, because the sad truth is that a good education is something everyone should have access to and it seems unfair that I have access to a great education for factors outside of my control, which will then just perpetuate the cycle.

Question for you, admin: If I'm interested in reaching out to run this page when you retire next semester, what should I do? I like the direction that you've taken WashU confessions this past year, with increased transparency about what does and doesn't get posted and more importantly why you do and do not post certain confessions. I'd like to continue the work you do, I think something like WashU Confessions does really add to the community.
