Sometimes I go to my snapchat friends list and I just start typing gibberish. I don't send it. I just delete it and go about my day. This way, the person will get a notification that I started typing something, but they never receive a message. They're left thinking about me and questioning why I started typing something to them--Did I change my mind? Was it a fluke? Did the message not go through? Who knows... but they've thought about me, and that's all that matters to me.
