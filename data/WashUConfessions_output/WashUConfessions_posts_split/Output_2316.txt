I confess that some of these recent "the right guy won't ask me out" type of confessions (except 1506, that shit's lame and he deserves whatever misfortune befalls him) are annoying to me. I'm extraordinarily shy, so asking you (whoever "you" may end up being) out would take a monumental effort that, given the not at all insignificant chance of getting rejected, just isn't worth it.

But that isn't what's annoying. The annoying thing is that, in the 21st century, you still expect us to be the ones to ask you out. Why can't you ask us out? Just because we're scared or unwilling to ask you out doesn't mean we won't say yes if you ask. We aren't (for the most part) assholes who will reject you out of hand, nor are we all sex crazed barbarians. If you know of a guy you want to ask you out, but he won't do it, ask him first. Odds are he'll say yes.
