I really like this guy, who has said that he's also into guys (thankfully skipping any awkward asumptions), but I feel too worried about opening myself up emotionally to ask him out. Emotions are really difficult. I've only been out for a short time, and I'm not used to being able to be open about liking or dating guys.
