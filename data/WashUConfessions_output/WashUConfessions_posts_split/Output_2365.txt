I think I've fallen for a girl whose name I still don't know. I saw you in olin today (Wednesday) and smiled, when you were walking out of class in May (I smiled) and I can't help but smile. I don't know what to say, so I'm just going to say that next Friday I will be outside olin at 9 PM and I hope you'll show up so that I can finally day hello!
