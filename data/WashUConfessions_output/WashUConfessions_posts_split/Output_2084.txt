It breaks my heart that our community is so divided. Everyone has rights as American citizens. In order to have your rights protected as an African American, you must be a saint. But if the individual was not a member of a minority group, one's rights would be protected whether he/she was a saint, murderer, drug addict, thief, cheat, etc. That's just sad. I don't condone illegal activity at all, but making poor decisions is not enough to claim someone does not have rights.
