While this is not my story, nor an anonymous one at that (the victim has already posted this on at least one public facebook forum) -- I feel as though this is something that deserves as much attention as possible. While there are many things to love about WashU, the administration's repeated tyrannical abuse of power for reputational gains is disgusting. Would the administration have cared to put effort into confronting the racial incidents of last year had the story not received a national headline? I'll never know. But I would like to know how they intend to respond to this if we can get this story similar attention. 

"I am writing on the Wash U Class of 2015 Facebook page to shed light upon occurrences as well as incidents last Spring that do not align with the fundamental principals and pillars that Washington University students and staff alike both strongly stand up for. What makes Wash U a special place and a premier academic institution in the world is the school’s strong devotion to excellence in academics, student life, equal opportunity, diversity, and care for students. That is why we as college students so greatly enjoy the undergraduate experience on the Danforth Campus. However, from time to time, occurrences happen on campus just like any other college that fail to stand by these ambitions. During last Spring on the Danforth Campus as a Sophomore, I had a tough semester. Almost everyone at Wash U knows how hard it is to balance rigorous academics, extra circular goals, as well as social expectations. It can become overbearing at times and a drowning experience. I had been incredibly open with using the resources that Wash U carries from a mental health standpoint to support students as well as further resources such as weekly visits to the St. Louis Behavioral Center to manage my own mental health issues regarding anxiousness and OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder). I also felt social anxiety stemming from being in situations around groups of people participating in the use of illegal street drugs which I strongly opposed against. As the weight of the semester began to press on me and my results in school and extra circular activities began to slowly spiral downward, I expressed self-harm and need for help privately amongst close friends. When I reached out for support and a backbone of stability from the Wash U administration and staff that I had trusted so dearly, I was shocked to find the complete opposite. I was assaulted by a Police Officer outside Bear’s Den on the South 40 who grabbed me by my back and neck and physically wrestled me to the South 40 police station although I provided no resistance and peacefully asked what was going on. I found upper management administration members quickly profile me as the “kid who wears headphones all the time”. Since he wears headphones all the time, he must be a bullied insecure kid who may be mentally and emotionally unstable and react outwardly. These were statements later relayed from my attorney to me that school officials had told him. I found this profiling to be just as unethical as racism as far as discrimination goes. Labeling a kid as a possible criminal because he likes to listen to music. The administration, particularly Dean Carroll (Dean of Students) and Tamara King (Head Judicial Administrator) went further to compare the student to the psychopath from Virginia Tech in 2007 who so disgustingly took away 30+ lives and injured many more in the most disgusting act of violence on a college campus in history. It was a very serious insult that my parents and I took deeply. I was dumbfounded. Wash U is a school, more so than almost any school in the US that stresses the importance of helping students out first. Whether it be through Cornerstone for Academics, Student Health Services, or any other student aiding organization on campus that Wash U so proudly boasts, one of Wash U’s main differentiating factors is its image as a “Student-First” University. When I looked for help towards the upper management on campus, I was alarmed to not find this. Instead, I found a few key figures trying to protect the brand and reputation of the School rather than protect the student themselves- the most important assets of a University. I found a management staff that was ready to roll over a student like a tractor and hide it under the ground not visible to other parties of the campus community. I was shocked. I really did not know how to react. As the semester closed, I was faced with further put-downs from University employees to my character for no logical reason. School employees and staff in the athletics realm also repeatedly made disgusting and abusive statements directly towards me such as “your head is fuc*ed up”, “don’t shoot yourself”, “have fun in community college” and also clear white lies in mocking ways. I started to feel ganged up by Wash U. Instead of helping me out, school officials were standing on top and crushing me. I did not know how to react, so I scheduled a meeting with Dean Carroll at his earliest possible availability. Dean Caroll did not budge with response to my allegations. I started to feel ganged up upon by Wash U employees and administrators. And when I expressed my displeasure, sadness, anger, as well as frustration to my best friend on campus, Dean Carroll immediately got me put in handcuffs and sent to St. Louis County Jail for hours until 3 am in the night. (The WUPD officer even said he did not want to arrest me, but Dean Carroll was his boss and he had to follow orders). I was left homeless for the night as my phone was taken away and I had no communication. Surrounding me with real life criminals for the night was the administrations message to me. The very staff I had entrusted upon enrolling in Wash U to help create a terrific undergraduate experience were the ones intimidating me, and literally putting me behind bars. From there, after my parents had picked me up from St. Louis, Dean Carroll and Tamara King further ganged up on me by stating that if I shared any of this information publicly on a medium such as Facebook, they would immediately expel me. They further went on to say, that if I stepped foot on the Danforth Campus, they would have me handcuffed and sent to jail within seconds. I found the image of Wash U as a University that will do anything to best accommodate and protect their students to be a façade orchestrated by two major players, a Dean of Students and a Judicial Administrator. Carroll and King ran over a defenseless student like a bull dozer simply because they could, because they had the authority and power to and the student was just that- a defenseless student. They could threaten to expel him, arrest him, suspend him and he could not do a thing about it. After coming home, I took it with a chip upon my shoulder to prove the Wash U administration wrong, that I could and would be medically cleared to return to campus. Working two jobs in the financial services as well as entrepreneurship start-Up industry as well as working with my doctor at the St. Louis Behavioral Center on a daily basis, and a Palo Alto psychiatrist, I had received medical clearance and had met much more than enough requirements to return to school and regularly every four weeks, e-mailed Ms. King my intentions of coming back this fall. She ignored them. After following the precedent guidelines set specifically by Ms. King, I returned to campus alongside my Mom to go through the steps to be cleared to come back. From there after repeatedly every four weeks telling Ms. King, I was coming back and to plan accordingly, I was met with the response that it is going to take 10 days for a judicial committee to be set up and during those ten days you are banned from campus although you are medically cleared and have no past legal violations. Then Ms. King went on to “claim” that I would be definitely suspended at the very least from Wash U. Not knowing how to react and not coming from a necessarily high income family where my parents could take so much time off as well as afford a place to stay, I did not know what to do. My family and I felt forced against a wall to pursue only one logical option: sign withdrawal papers from Washington University, a school that I loved. I was never given a voice, an even playing field, a hearing, and was ultimately trampled upon by the senior members of Washington University. I am posting this on a public forum to shed light and awareness on the fact that situations can occur at Wash U. Senior level staff such as Dean Carrol and Tamara King as well as fellow faculty and staff were wrong in every single viewpoint in grouping up and intimidating a defenseless student as well as his family. I hope that members of the Washington U community who stand against discrimination, bullying, and abuse should be aware of these examples and how although these characteristics may be violated amongst the student body, they can and are equally at times violated by Wash U employees themselves who themselves must be held just as accountable."
