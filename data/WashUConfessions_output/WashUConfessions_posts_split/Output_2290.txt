I confess that I'm mostly happy with all parts of my college experience but one; sex. Simply put, I'm bad at it. When I'm sober I finish way too quickly, and one or two drinks gives me unconquerable whiskey-dick. I have a fairly high sex drive, and the few times I've been successful I've enjoyed it immensely, but for some reason the physical process doesn't work for me. It's gotten to the point where I start intentionally sabotaging any relationship (or one night stand) that looks like its going to lead to sex, because every time I disappoint a girl it just compounds the problem. I don't really have a point to this confession, but goddamn does it suck to miss out on a huge aspect of college because of something I can't seem to control.
