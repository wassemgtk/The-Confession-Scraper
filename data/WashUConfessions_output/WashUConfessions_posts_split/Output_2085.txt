I will probably get some hate for this, and that is fine. I feel I should put this out there with the Ferguson decision about to be announced any day now. Although none of us can say for certain what really happened during the incident, frankly, I have no respect for someone who goes and robs a store and beats up the store owner, which is what Michael Brown did. I don't think we should be glorifying a person with low morals, even if he was described as a "gentle giant".
