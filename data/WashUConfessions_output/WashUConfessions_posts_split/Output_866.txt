I am genuinely curious: for those of you that feel upset by other people at WashU being overweight or physically unhealthy, is there any particular reason? I feel like as a community in general, we have a lot of thoughtful, healthy, and productive discussions about a lot of things, and I am so grateful for that, but on this issue in particular I see a lot of people being pretty condescending and I just don't understand what creates that divide in people's minds. 

I am someone who has struggled with my weight and with disordered eating, and I understand that it's a problem, but I know that my struggle is no one's problem but mine, and maybe my doctor's. I just don't get why someone else would want to make it their problem, too. I am lucky in that I have a lot healthier a relationship with myself now than I did at the end of high school, so people's criticism doesn't really bother me. 

But I do think that if you really want to help people who are unhealthy/overweight, pursuing a career in a health-related field, or maybe volunteering to play sports with kids or something would be a lot better outlet for your passionate feelings than rude anonymous comments.
