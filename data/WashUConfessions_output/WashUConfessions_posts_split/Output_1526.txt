So after reading these posts about tuition I have something to say to the contrary.  Yes tuition being high sucks.  I wish it was lower, but to be honest the only way private university tuition could ever be lower would be to have the government subsidize it (which I think would be a worthy use of taxpayer money).  That's how state universities are able to charge low rates.  Harvard tuition is $43938. WUSTL is $45700. Northwestern tuition is $46836 (even higher than WUSTL)

Yes every dollar  matters but when you look at it, every top private university has similar tuition fees.  And honestly, WUSTL has one of the prettiest campus's in America (in this poster's opinion).  That upkeep costs extra money that comes from tuition as well as paying professors decent salaries and proving for everything else.  Do I think college should be affordable? yes.  Do I think there is any other option besides government subsidy? no.

And another thing, at the end of the day you're not just paying for better professors, you could go to a free public library and get the best professors ever in between the pages of a book.  you're paying to be in a top academic environment with brilliant peers who also want to learn.  That changes the dynamics  of your learning in subtle ways that are hard to detect when not looking.  So think about that next time you're determining the value of your education at WUSTL.
