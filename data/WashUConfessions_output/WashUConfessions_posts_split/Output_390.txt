I want to leave my current religion and join the Catholic Church. The only problem is that I don't want people to think I'm converting because of any particular person. I've been really unhappy in my current church for a year or so now and my family is constantly pushing me to leave it just because they disagree with the doctrine. I don't want them to think I'm becoming Catholic for them. I'm also dating a Catholic and don't want him to think I'm converting so that we can be Catholic together. I know I can express emphatically that I'm converting for myself, but I don't think anyone will ever believe me.
