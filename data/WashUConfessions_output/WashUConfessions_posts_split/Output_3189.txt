A friend of mine broke up with his girlfriend recently. I don't know her well, but we've talked a few times, and she seems neat. She's really upset over it, and I tried to be supportive and be there for her. But, then she told me that the two of them are trying to get back together, and she's hoping it will work. But, I know from talking to my friend that he doesn't want to get back with her, he's only trying to make her less upset, and he told me not to tell her. It seems wrong to watch her hope for something I know won't happen, but I don't know what else to do.
