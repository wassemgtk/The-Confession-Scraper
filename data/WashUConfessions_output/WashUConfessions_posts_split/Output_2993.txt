Wash U students for the most part are an emphatic bunch but taking cheap shots at Fontbonne University, a school that caters to a student body that's different than ours is not cool and I think it reflects poorly on the people who do it. What are you saying really. Only top #20 colleges are worth going to? Check your privilege.
