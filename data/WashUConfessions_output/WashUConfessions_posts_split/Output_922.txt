Whenever I don't have a significant other in my life, I'm not nearly as happy as when I do.  It's not to say I'm depressed and can't get out of bed when I'm single, but I feel best when I have someone in my life.  There is something about having a consistent person to text, share news with, and have by your side that I find really comforting.  A lot of friends call me insecure because "my happiness relies on someone else," but I'm quite confident in who I am...I just really like having a significant other in my life.
