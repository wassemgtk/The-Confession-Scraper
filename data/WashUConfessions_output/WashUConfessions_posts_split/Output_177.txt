I finally completed the slow transition from "that kid who does drugs" to "that kid who knows where we can get drugs" to "that kid who will be the middle man to get us our drugs" to "that kid who sells drugs". Really didn't think I'd ever be dealing, but shit the extra money, small in amount though it is, is real nice.
