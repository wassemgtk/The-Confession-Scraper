In the midst of musical diversity, I feel musically isolated at Wash U. So we have Disney acapella and jazz in Holmes and even k-pop dance groups, but we don't have one measly club dedicated to hard rock or metal? I know most people probably don't think this is a big deal, but it's frustrating not having people to discuss common musical interests with. Sure, Ariane Grande is great and all, but where's the Amon Amarth? Where's the A7x? Or at least some Metallica! Are there really no fellow head bangers out there?
