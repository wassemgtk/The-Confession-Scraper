I think the events of the past few months have changed my life in a big way. Before all of this I'd been really interested in St. Louis' (and America's) long history of racism but now I feel for sure it's no longer possible to ignore what's right in front of us all. The topic is so volatile that debate/discussion easily and often devolves into a shouting match between two opposing camps, which I think points to a fundamental problem in our discourse but also within society, one that's built into our cities, into the patterns of where we live. I'm talking about segregation, which as washu students we should all be keenly aware of. 

Our school sits almost directly on the racial faultline of the city. To drive from Clayton to a neighborhood like Wells-Goodfellow is to travel from one world to another in only a matter of miles. There's definitely relatively integrated and diverse parts of the region but by and large blacks and whites live apart. Beyond the inherent inequality in this situation, it makes it harder for us to engage with and understand each other--out of sight, out of mind. We shouldn't accept the state of affairs or perpetuate the division any longer. Easier said than done, but at least it's worth striving toward.
