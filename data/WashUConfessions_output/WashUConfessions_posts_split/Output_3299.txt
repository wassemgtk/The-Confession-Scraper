I'd really like to meet whoever said that WashU guarantees housing all 4 years. Because I'm a sophomore, and it's absolutely ridiculous how unhelpful reslife has been. I understand that as classes get bigger, there's going to be less space and less room to be picky about where you live, but that just means that you either need to think about that ahead of time and change the way housing works, or be able to answer people's questions.
