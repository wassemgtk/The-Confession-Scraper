I confess that I don't quite fit in at WashU: I was brought up by a family of Beluga whales near the Arctic, and walking normally is something I've had to practice over and over again. It's also really hard on my self-esteem when my friend claims baby sea cows are the cutest creatures on earth because I know I'll never reach that level of majestic beauty. Never the less, I am happy with how this year turned out, even if the weather was a little too dry and the water tasted weird in olin.
