going through your feedback, I've re-enabled submissions on washuconfessions.com! Just some updates:

- I decided not to implement the rule where confessions must start with "I confess that". It could be a good rule of thumb to follow, but I won't enforce it.
- Confessions that are responses to previous submissions will not get their own post. I'll be posting them as comments to the original post to avoid spamming News Feeds. 
- I'll be accepting fewer "question" confessions. If you submit one, please try to phrase it as a confession! I want to give everyone an anonymous voice in the community, but let's not turn this page into "Ask Wash U". Please? :)

That's all. Thanks so much for bearing with me while I figure this out! Looking forward to putting peoples' anonymous confessions online.  

Take care, and don't run with scissors!
