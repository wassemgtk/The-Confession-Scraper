If you can't tip AT LEAST 15%, you shouldn't be eating out at a restaurant, its that simple.  I don't have a ton of money, so I don't eat out except for very very rarely, cheating a waiter on a tip is not a way to save money.  On another note, I tire of hearing people argue that tipping shouldn't exist and waiters should be paid more (great insight) as that is generally an excuse for not leaving a tip.  You are not fighting the system by not leaving a tip, you are cheating a person out of part of their wage.
