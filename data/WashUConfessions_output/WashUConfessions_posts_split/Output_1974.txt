As an Independent, I feel bad for some my liberal friends because they live in a bubble where most other students and faculty agree with them, so they never have their ideas challenged. I feel like it was good for me to come into Wash U with sort of middle/slightly right-of-the-spectrum beliefs because I have to constantly defend those beliefs. Sometimes I end up changing my mind, and sometimes it helps me strengthen what I believe in. Most of my liberal friends have never even HEARD a conservative idea, except for whatever bullshit they hear from the media. I'm not saying they have to agree with me, I just think that it would be good for them to know WHY they believe what they believe and be able to express it beyond just major talking points. I mean, that's like the point of higher education, isn't it? Or, what it used to be anyway...
