I was prescribed to start an antidepressant about three weeks ago, but I still haven't started because it is so hard to schedule an appointment with the psychiatrist at SHS. Mind you, I am a returning client, so its not like I have to wait the normal amount of time before seeing someone new. The first appointment I got is a week from tomorrow, and thats just waiting another agonizing week before being able to feel better. Meanwhile, this week has been the worst week I've ever had at WashU, academically, with extracurriculars, and also received crushing news about an application decision. It would have been nice to have been able to start this medication weeks ago, in order to not have to deal with crippling depression on top of everything else this week. (Or at least feel able to cope with the week better.)

I guess what Im trying to say is, the mental health resources at SHS are horrible, and the process should not take this frustratingly long. This needs to be fixed, and students should feel like they have hope in recovering from any illness, whether it be physical or mental. Mental health issues should be treated just as seriously as physical health issues.
