If you're feeling down about midterms, I promise you're doing better than me. In the middle of my midterm, I got a papercut. Worried about having time to write my essay, I did not go to the bathroom for a paper towel. Despite my best efforts, I got blood in my Blue Book. I'm hoping my TA passes it off as ketchup, or, at the very least, doesn't comment.
