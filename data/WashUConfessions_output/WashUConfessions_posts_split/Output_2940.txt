We were throwing this rager at my friend's house last week. There was this hot chick there dancing super slutty. As the night went on she got worse and worse and guys were giving her shots left and right. Later on I decided to try my luck and take her up to a bed room. At this point she was shit faced and I only had a couple of beers. We got to the room, shut the door, and she threw herself onto the bed. This was my chance. She sprawled out over the covers, mumbling words I couldn't understand. I knew she wouldn't remember any of this the next morning, so with a half grin on my face I did what any guy would do...I sat her up to make sure she puked, gave her some water, and tucked that bitch in and said good night. Sexual assault is not cool.
