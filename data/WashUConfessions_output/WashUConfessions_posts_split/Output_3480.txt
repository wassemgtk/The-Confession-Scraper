Dear future freshmen of WashU: Since lots of you seem to be looking at this page anyways, here's some inside perspective- WashU has a gorgeous campus, amazing community of people, and such good food. Although it is a challenging school, you'll be thankful that it is. You will learn so much inside and outside the classroom. You'll discover who you are as a person and meet a whole new world of people. There is nothing and will never be anything like WashU and I am proud to say that I go to this school and I promise you, you will be too. I wouldn't trade my experiences for anything even though they haven't all been great. It's the bad experiences that let you truly enjoy the good experiences.
