I wish Provost Thorp would actually outline exactly what the tuition increase is covering. What line items did this committee look at and decide "We need to raise tuition to cover this this and this". The whole "The tuition you pay allows us to fulfill our mission of providing a world-class university experience inside and outside the classroom" explanation sounds satisfying, but doesn't actually mean anything. As the people that willingly force ourselves into debt for the next 10 years, we deserve to know.
