All fraternity and sorority presidents just received this e-mail: "Chapter Presidents, House Managers and IFC Execs: (Sorority presidents and WPA this information should probably be made available to your members as well) As you are all aware, WILD will be here tomorrow (Friday) and I want to make sure we are all on the same page regarding expectations of the chapters and activities at fraternity houses. Make sure your members are aware of everything in this email please. Res Life, WUPD and members of our staff will be doing rounds by the fraternity houses and all Res Life areas during the day and during WILD itself. Jon – Please make sure the members of ZBT are aware of this information as well as they come onto campus and because there should not be anything happening at the house or apartments off-campus. NEW INFORMATION: There is a very large and important event occurring in the Knight Center from 4:30-6:30pm. You can be assured that all administrators will be attending at least a portion of this event and as they are going to and from the Knight Center, they will be by the Upper Row. This means that everyone will be within earshot of the fraternities (and House 1) so we’re really not kidding about the “no outside music” stipulation below. It will be very easy to draw attention because of the location of this event so PLEASE be smart and comply if WUPD or a staff member addresses your chapter. Another key thing to remember is that noise could become an issue by the Knight Center as your members walk to the Quad. There may be a B&D guard posted by house 1 and the Law School to direct the flow of traffic away from the Knight Center entrance to the other side of Mudd Field. I would strongly encourage you to have multiple sober contacts at the house and if you are not someone that we can ask for if something comes up, send me the name and cell phone number of who will be present and can address situations if they come up. Please also remind your chapter members (and any potential guests) that Walk In Chow Down is on the South 40 from 2-5pm…so people should go over there and get food and hang out. Our expectation is also that you will strongly encourage anyone in/around the upper and lower row to head down to WILD at 5:30pm when the doors open and to stay down there for the duration of the show or at the very least, not use your houses as an alternative venue for activities that night. People will still be walking the row during WILD so the expectation of no parties or large gatherings will be in place the entire night. To avoid any issues please know the following (Yes, this is the same information I sent you last semester…read it again please): · No music outside – that will naturally draw people to your house because they will assume something is going on. Once they get to your house, you know they will try to enter or will draw the attention of more people that you likely don’t want to have to deal with. (This also means no music should be heard outside through windows) · Do not prop open doors…it again will bring attention to your house and others will assume it is an open invitation to enter your house. · Be smart about what you bring outside. IF 20 members are sitting on the porch…all with Big Gulp cups…might draw some attention. Just be smart and use common sense. · If we see groups of people entering your house (like more than 5 at a time) that will draw attention and lead us to believe that something is going on inside the house when it shouldn’t be. This will result in one of us asking to talk to you and then entering your house to check the situation. · We’ll be asking groups of people standing around outside to move along if it appears that they don’t live in the houses and that they aren’t really there for any real purpose. If they then decide to settle on your porch to avoid having to leave, feel free to also ask them to move along J · If we come up to any house and have concerns (large gatherings outside, members bringing in large amounts of alcohol, groups of people entering your house, loud noise coming from the house that would indicate a party is going on, etc) you will get one warning and be asked to clear things out. If it needs to be addressed a second time during the day/night, things will again be shut down and you’ll have a report written up. · Just be smart. WILD is not a time when you or your members are responsible for entertaining the entire campus, so don’t feel any pressure to do so! I want you and your members to have fun…but part of that fun should include not having to deal with me at any point during the night unless it is a friendly chat about how great the weather is! I won’t be confronting anyone or entering houses unless I have GOOD reason to do so. Most of those reasons are listed above. Others would include a cloud of marijuana smoke coming from your house or other obvious illegal activities – which I am more than confident we will NOT have to worry about this year. · Also be aware that because programming ends this week, the Greek Life Standards Board will not be meeting. So any reports will be handled administratively by SIL staff members. The actions of seniors are also included in this…so yes, they could do something that your chapter has to pay the price for even if they are gone – make sure they are aware of this. They also should know that issues that come up this weekend could impact their involvement with Senior Week. Let me know if you have any questions and enjoy the rest of your week!" I'm not allowed on my porch or allowed to play music outside on the one day party we're allowed all year? Further, I'm not allowed to invite my friends over to my residence in groups larger than 5. Regardless of your views on Greek Life, I hope everyone can agree that these impositions on pretty reasonable expectations of freedom are ridiculous. And they've slowly been increasing in frequency and become increasingly institutionalized with each passing year.
