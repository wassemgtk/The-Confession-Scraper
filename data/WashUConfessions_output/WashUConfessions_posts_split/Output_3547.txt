Riding my bike on campus I have discovered my biggest irritations. And all of them are pedestrians. So to everyone staring at their phone while walking, blasting music on their giant headphones, and most of all to the wonderful examples of human intelligence who walk in a legion on the biking side of the sidewalk, i will hit you. I will not care. And I am not sorry.
