I confess that as a queer woman, I have many difficulties about my Christian upbringing. How can I follow a religious practice that has the marginalization of women interwoven in its text? I don't believe in societal patriarchy, but I was raised to respect religious patriarchy. It's all a bundle of confusion. It's like I have to be a self-respecting woman or a Christian, but I can't seem to mitigate them both.
