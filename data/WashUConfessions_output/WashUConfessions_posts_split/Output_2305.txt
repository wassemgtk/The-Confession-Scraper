My professor emailed me saying I have missed too many classes and it is going to affect my grade. I would rather just deal with the lower grade - and even that is making me beat myself up and feel very anxious - than ever admit the reason I am absent is because my depressive tendencies and insomnia make it impossible to get out of bed sometimes.
