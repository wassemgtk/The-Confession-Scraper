I don't regret recently breaking up with my girlfriend (now ex). She was really shallow and annoying, and I knew I shouldn't have stayed with her that long. Immediately after I broke up with her I found someone incredible! My new girlfriend has an awesome body and a really beautiful personality, sometimes it's hard to express how I feel about her because I feel it so strongly.
