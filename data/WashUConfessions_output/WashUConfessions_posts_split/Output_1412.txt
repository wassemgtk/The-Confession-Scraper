In all honesty, I've reached the depths of rock bottom. I'm both terrified of what that means, and thrilled about what that means for my own future. On one hand, I've struggled enough with soul-crushing depression that I won't deny I've been quite literally on the edge of letting go. 

On the other hand, I've somehow managed to realize my own potential as a human being. I have finally recognized that I, as a person, exist. I have finally realized that no matter how meaningless my life may be to the universe, I still fucking matter.
