These days I feel like WashU hasn’t taught me much about anything really. I feel l have learned very little in my 3 years of college education after investing over $150,000 in tuition so far. Of course, I’ve gained some new insights and perspectives in life, made new friends and memories, have more connections and experiences and have enjoyed the freedom of new life in college and eventually I will have a bachelor’s degree from a prestigious university, yet I feel that the money isn’t worth enough in terms of what and how much I gain out of this. Sometimes I wonder if I should have gone to a cheaper college that will provide me with the similar experiences and now I feel bad for my parents investing so much money for my college education that doesn’t even guarantee me a job or a much better future, necessarily.
