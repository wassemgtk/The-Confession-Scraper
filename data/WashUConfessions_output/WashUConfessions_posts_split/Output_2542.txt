As a sophomore I'm entirely torn about whether or not to go abroad. I'm worried I will miss out on things on campus because of being away for a semester and I'll be behind on a job search and class requirements at the end of next year. But then why does everyone say it's so great and never acknowledge these downsides of going away for a semester?
