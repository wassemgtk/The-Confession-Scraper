I was going to go to Princeton until I saw how little they gave me in financial aid.

Though I'm mostly over it now and very happy at Wash U, a small part of me died inside when so many of the Princeton students visited here this weekend.

I know my attachment to that school is 100% because of name and prestige and I feel like such an entitled asshole for feeling the way that I do (and it's maybe true).
