I confess that I have never been more sure of my undiagnosed OCD than when I picked up the latest Pokemon games.

You cannot rename a pokemon you didn't catch yourself.  So in game trades....
Oh you want to give me a Steelix in the first hour of the game? Yeah But its nicknamed Thumper.

FUCK THAT AND FUCK YOU.  I'll get my own damn Steelix.
