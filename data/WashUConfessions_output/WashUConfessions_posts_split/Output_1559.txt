I've recently gotten out of a long relationship (over 3 years) which lasted the majority of high school. We were on and off during first semester. We officially ended over winter break. It was a pretty shaky, explosive goodbye.

With valentine's day coming up, I couldn't help but to peek at her fb. I found out she already started dating another guy by Jan 19... Less than a week after we were finished.

And honestly the only thing getting me through this week now is that I'm going to get shit piss drunk for mardi gras..
