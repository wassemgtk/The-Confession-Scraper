I think people oughta be careful saying that this confessions page is fostering a community spirit/dialogue that's good for the school. No doubt this page is important but don't get it twisted, normal healthy communities do not communicate via anonymous backbiting, complaining, and stuff you wouldn't say (or at least say in those words) in public. It's about open, civil, and respectful discussion/debate/interaction.
