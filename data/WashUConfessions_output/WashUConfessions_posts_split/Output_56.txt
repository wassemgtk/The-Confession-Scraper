As an extrovert, something I've always struggled with is being 
alone. Especially at such an upbeat, social, conversation-oriented university, It was easy for me to feel that I was alone or out of the loop. But tonight I spent several hours just wandering around Forest Park, listening to my favorite music and reading Harry Potter. It was that moment when I realized the importance of having some time for yourself, and for the first time in a while I felt comfortable and blissful being by myself.
