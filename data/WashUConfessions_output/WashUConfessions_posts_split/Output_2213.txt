It's taken me a couple days to find the words for this. I'm not sure I'll be able to  find the words to completly express how I feel because I have yet to understand how or why I feel the way I do. I'm an upperclassman here. I get A's or high B's in my classes. I've worked in more labs than most people my age, been published, and I have a large group of friends to be around.

I'm well liked by the people that know me and I'm the most outgoing of my close friends. I'm also the one they trust to talk about all of their problems. They trust me. I feel like I should be able to tell they care about me.

The life I have right now should be perfect and yet I just feel empty. When I try to talk to my friends about my problems, they tell me to stop being bitter. When I talk to my parents, they tell me that I have had a better life than most and that I should get over it. They all treat my problems as jokes; conversation pieces to be had over dinner. They treat my feelings as after thoughts and simple issues just because I help them solve their problems so easily. It is easy to be logical for someone else. It is hard to be so logical when all you hear is that your problems are insignificant.

I throw myself into my work to make my emotions numb. They tell me to keep busy and the pain will go away. They tell me that if I'm busy, there will be no time to feel pain. Well I've been busy. I've built a résumé longer than half my college essays. I've worked out so often that my feet have bleed and I've passed out. I've surrounded myself with people that "care" and yet I feel alone.

I feel alone because I have yet to find a friend who sees me for how I am. I feel alone because the people who tell me they care treat me like I'm insane. They make me feel different but tell me I'm just like them. If I was like them, then why don't they treat me like a person and less like a dog. Someone they can call to them when they want to talk, but they expect to take care of herself when they are done.

I've lost trust in people. I trust strangers more than I trust "friends". I tell strangers how I feel, yet I don't trust their sympathy. I think that if they get to know me, then they will treat me like my "friends".

I don't want sympathy for what I'm saying here because I know that I won't really be helped by it at this point. What I want is for this to never happen to someone else. My "friends will never see how I feel because I now hide my feelings in sarcasm. I hide my sadness in journals. I am too afraid to get close to people, so I now just move through life numb to sympathy and indifferent to the problems of others. I want people to look at their friends and remember some very simple things. Extroversion is not always happiness. Sometimes sarcasm hides truth. Your words have meaning. Sticks and stones may break bones, but words can kill people. Depression has many faces and sometimes it's a smile.
