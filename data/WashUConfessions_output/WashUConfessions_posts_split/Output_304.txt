I'm pretty sure I was more empathetic before medical school, and the drudgery and toxic culture of medicine has turned me into a jaded, hateful person. 9/10 patients I see are poor, uneducated and ungrateful. They most likely ate, drank, or smoked themselves to their death bed and they expect us to ooze sympathy out of every pore while we're sleep-deprived, stressed, and broke. I hate medical school for what it's done to me. But maybe this is who I really am.
