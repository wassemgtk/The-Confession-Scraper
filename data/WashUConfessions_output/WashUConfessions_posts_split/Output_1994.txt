For around a year I was good friends with a couple who seemed perfect for each other -- both of them had many of the same interests, they enjoyed doing things together, and they overall liked each other. Then I heard the girl arguing with the guy over the appropriateness of a fairly sex-heavy TV show he had watched for a class assignment, and shortly afterward I overheard the guy talking with a few of his other friends about how there were things he wanted to try (like drinking) that she would never let him do. Coming from a household myself where my mom was very demanding and my dad was a bit of a pushover but didn't quite agree with her on everything, I felt sorry for their future kids and really wanted to talk to them about their compatibility with each other, but I felt too afraid to do so (mostly because arguments about such things are mildly triggering for me due to how they turned out with my parents when I was a kid). I confess that I'm glad these two people had a mutual breakup this summer, though I also confess that I wish I could be a little more assertive when I need to be, without being afraid of possible social repercussions.
