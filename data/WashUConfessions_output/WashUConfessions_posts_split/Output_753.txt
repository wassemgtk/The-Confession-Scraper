Look, freshmen, if your professor can't teach well, give him constructive criticism in a mature manner. There's no fucking reason why you should attack him on a personal level. Do you really need to laugh and belittle his physical appearance, clothing choice, or roll your eyes when he pauses for a few seconds before speaking because English isn't his first language? Do you really need to sneer and scoff at his every movement? Does it make you feel cool when you Snapchat photos of him teaching with snarky captions to your friends? 

NEWSFLASH: you look like an asshole when you make fun of your teachers to gain your peers' approval. And, you're ruining the learning environment for those who actually want to pay attention. This isn't high school anymore. Please get your shit together, because the next time I hear you whine I will literally chuck my ancient, 14-pound graphing calculator right at your head.
