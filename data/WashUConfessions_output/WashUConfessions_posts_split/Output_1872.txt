Over 5 years ago my father passed away, and a family friend gave us a Christmas ornament of 'Heaven's Golden Gates' that we hang on the Christmas tree. Now, I'm not at all religious, but I value this ornament because it's a symbol of my father who can't be with us for the holidays. With that said, I always seem to be in charge of it. My mother never really seems to know where it is, and her nonchalance about its whereabouts frankly upset me because she clearly doesn't see the importance of the ornament. It's more than just an object. It feels like I'm the only one that cares - about the ornament,  about his lack of presence.
