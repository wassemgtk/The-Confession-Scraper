My girlfriend physically abuses me and thinks it's no big deal but I think she's really hypocritical. She's a hardcore feminist and is a WGS major and I just don't get it. She talks in social circles all the time about how abuse is a real issue and then hits me back at my apartment later on the same day. Why? Because she's mad about stuff in her own life. It hurts and there's bruises on my neck because of it. She talks all the time about "male privilege" and how women need to be empowered. If this is what she's learning in class, like this is how to feel empowered by hitting me when I'm sitting down at my computer or going to the bathroom, then this WGS program at WashU is horrible.
