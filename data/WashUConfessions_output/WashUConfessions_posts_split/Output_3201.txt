Alright, I'm sorry to be a dick, but I have to call you out. To the Asian girl wearing a KKG sweater walking out of class in McDonnnell today: you walked out of the door, threw your gum at the trash, missed, glanced at your gum on the ground, and continued walking out of the building. Seriously, don't do that. Especially when you're wearing letters...although people shouldn't judge a whole body based on the few actions of one person, they often unfortunately do. When you wear that sweater, you represent your sorority and the entire Greek system at wash u; don't be a part of what makes people think we're assholes. By the way, I picked up your gum and threw it out...you're welcome
