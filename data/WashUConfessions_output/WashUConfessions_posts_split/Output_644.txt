I am the (often-absentminded) girl who rides the pink scooter, and I often forget where I put it. But, I haven't been able to find it lately and now I'm worried... I asked WUPD and they hadn't seen it. Have any of you seen the pink scooter? Can you guys comment if you've seen it somewhere this past week or two?
