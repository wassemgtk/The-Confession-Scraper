The fact that a girl always wins Mr. WashU really annoys me. Why does WashU have to be so politically correct and fix "problems" that don't necessarily exist. There is still discrimination against women (just like there is discrimination against men and really everyone), but the guys that perform in Mr. WashU and the guys that watch it aren't thinking, "THIS SHOW IS THE CONTINUANCE OF THE PATRIARCHAL SOCIETY. LONG LIVE MEN!" I respect the women that perform in Mr. WashU but can we please retain some normality at this university. If we get caught up over water bottles, male talents shows, and reusable to-go boxes then we are going to miss the true problems in society.
