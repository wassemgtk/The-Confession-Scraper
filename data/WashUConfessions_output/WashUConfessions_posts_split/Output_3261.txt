I visited over 20 universities across the country over the course of my senior year in high school. For the life of me I just couldn't pin down where I wanted to spend the next four years of my life learning and making friends and experiencing life outside my region of familiarity. I arrived at WashU in mid-November with my Momma and a folded up map of the area. I was looking for a sign, any sign that this might be the place for me. I was getting desperate as so many of my classmates seemed to already have filled out the early-decision apps and everything. We started our tour and the university felt nice. Nothing special, they seemed to give the same general spiel as most places I had been. And then, just as we were passing the bunny statue, a small bird hopped off of one of the statue's ears and soared directly overhead like a glorious B-2 bomber. Also like a B-2, it dropped a nuclear bomb-sized shit on my head. That was when I knew. In that moment I was euphoric, I was infinite, I was covered in bird shit. God had given me the sign I had been waiting for. So now I'm a sophomore at WashU. I'd like to say it was because I fell in love with the campus or the students or the food or any other part of WashU, when in reality I made my decision because a dickbag bird decided to take a dump on my dome (can anyone say ALLITERATION whaaaaaaaaaaaat). Regardless, I made the right decision and I couldn't be happier I made the decision to come here.
