Staring at the blank page before me Open up the word doc window Let my mind illuminate the words that I could not find, Reaching for something in the distance So close you can almost taste it Release your inhibitions Feel the ideas in your brain No one else can think it for you Only you can write it down No one else, no one else Can write your fucking essay Rack your mind for words unthought of Live your life always in Olin, My 10-page research paper... Remains completely unwritten
