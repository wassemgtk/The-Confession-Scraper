To the individual who is annoyed with the black activists on campus, believes that we as blessed African Americans have never experienced real racism, and thinks that none of us are from the ghetto: you are very sadly mistaken. First of all, I am African American and I am from the ghetto. I live in one of the roughest neighborhoods in my city where poverty is huge and injustice is real. Secondly, just because we have gotten to WashU doesn't mean that we are extremely privileged.  I was blessed to receive a scholarship and even more blessed that my parents cared enough and were willing to sacrifice to give me whatever I needed to advance my education. Thirdly, I have experienced real racism. I have been called all types of slurs, randomly stopped by the police who thought it was fun to say you were a stopped for no reason other than being black, I have been followed around stores because I am a black and people thought I would steal, and several other incidents. Before you go acting like you know us, please get to know us individually and stop perpetuating the ignorance that got us involved in racial chaos in the first place.
