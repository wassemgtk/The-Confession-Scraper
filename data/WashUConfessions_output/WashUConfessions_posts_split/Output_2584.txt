So can we talk about how there is an event called Amistad happening on the Swamp right now? I'm a black member of ABS and we were invited to attend, but how can I go to something that shares its name with a slave ship? I get it, that's not what ALAS was going for, but still. Change the name and I'll consider going next year.
