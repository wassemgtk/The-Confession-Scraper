I get that it can be pretty cool to be in Lock and Chain, and that it's a great way to get involved in campus life and to make some really close friends. I'm also a huge fan of the emphasis the selection process puts into minority and marginalized group representation within the honor society.  But, and I know they have some secret significance which isn't this, the fact that it all too often comes with POCs walking the campus covered in chains irks me to no end.
