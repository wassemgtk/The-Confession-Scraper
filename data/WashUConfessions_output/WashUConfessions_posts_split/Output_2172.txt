I confess that, after reading many posts against Wash-U's administration, I personally am still here BECAUSE of it. I've never felt like "just a number" at this university: I've had to go on multiple medical leaves because of family issues, depression, and lack of motivation due to the wrong major. At any other University, I would've been kicked out by now for having a GPA lower than 2.0. Instead, I've had uplifting, personal conversations with the Dean of students, multiple faculty advisors I've exchanged personal e-mails with, and a myriad of professors who've taken personal interest in my journey here. Best of all, I'm here on a full scholarship (I only pay for my meal plan, health plan, books, and activity fees) and it will be extended to cover the semesters I've missed. Student-wise? I've made ONE friend who's kept in-touch with me, even though home is less than half an hour away. I might get some flack for saying this, but sometimes there are more important things a University has to worry about than the community around it and other societal issues. And for all the students struggling, sometimes all you have to do is ASK FOR HELP!
