I just graduated from WashU with some proud accomplishments and sad disappointments. I have no regrets but rather only questions of regrets in some of the decisions I've made. I know it's impossible to have it all; there's a tradeoff to every choice one makes, but I personally wish now I prioritized my tradeoffs differently. Most importantly, I found a new club on campus not too long ago that's been gaining popularity, but the people hardly know me even now. Some still don't know what I'll be doing after college, and some of them didn't even know I've already graduated. They're all understanding of how much I had to sacrifice, but at the end of the day, they still consider me a stranger and it's still my fault. I wish it didn't have to be this way, but what's done is done, but still, it's food for thought.
