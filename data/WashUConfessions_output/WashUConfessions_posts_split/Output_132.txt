I just found out that I'm basically infertile and I don't know how to handle the news. I mean I'm so young and nowhere near ready to have a child so I never really thought about how this could affect me. I'm fine with adoption but will my future partner be? I'm so confused. I'm so sad and numb but I don't understand why.
