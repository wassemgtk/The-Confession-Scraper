As a black student, I just want to say that BA also made me uncomfortable; Not because BA, the show, was uncomfortable, but because I felt like it was a pretty telling representation of universities across the nation just like WashU and it scared me. Its so hard to take everything that's happened and put all of it into perspective at once and BA did that, it made me scared to be on this campus and realize that while I am a part of this WashU community, it's very possible that if I didn't wear a backpack around campus, people would heavily doubt that I go here.

Of course I related to the feelings of "otherness" on this campus, but I mostly connected the sometimes sudden transformation of  "otherness" to marginalizaiton (when things like Michael Brown's shooting occur).

Sometimes when people get comfortable, they overlook what's right in front of them. People sometimes overlook that I am black (and that I don't want to be judged for it) but I want you to acknowledge that is a part of me. People overlook our Muslim students and how the attacks in France may have effected them. People throw around jokes about rape and sexual abuse all the time, and we've become desensitized to the needs of others for the sake of fitting in and being comfortable.

I came to WashU because I loved the people here; but I've been upset on countless occasions when the people I call my friends choose to challenge themselves by starting a new television show they were hesitant about, but don't want to talk about race, or sex, or things that may make them uncomfortable.

I'm uncomfortable for a good chunk of my time here, and as weird as this sounds, It would feel a little better if we, as a community were a bit uncomfortable together at events like BA or the Vagina Monologues, so I went and I listened, and I learned. And even if BA isn't your thing, I would just hope people would try to learn as rigorously as they do in their classes or extracurriculars (or even 1/100 of that) when it comes to things that effect our WashU community, even if its just 6% of it.
