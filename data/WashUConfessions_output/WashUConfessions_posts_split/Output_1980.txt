As someone who is recovering from an eating disorder, I am constantly confronted by things that might trigger me. But that's my responsibility to deal with. If I tried to make everyone adjust their lives so that they never reminded me of anything painful, no one on this campus could live their life. I guess it just frustrates me that there's such a huge emphasis on not triggering people here because it's become so much a joke that it's hard for me to share with the people close to me about what does trigger me. I'm not saying that we should be blatantly insensitive, but I think it's important to remember that everyone has been through pain and no one person's is more important than another's.
