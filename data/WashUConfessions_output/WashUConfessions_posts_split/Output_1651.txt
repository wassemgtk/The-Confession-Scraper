There was something in confession #2163 that really stood out to me and that was he part about "white people who have the luxury of connecting and being able to automatically get the same feeling I get when I see someone who looks like me". I found that really interesting because I don't think white people feel that way.

I'm not trying to argue with the OP or invalidate his/her experiences or opinions. And I agree with the part about people with similar lifestyles tending to connect with each other easier, but I think for white people it's not a very strong connection. I don't look around at other white people here at school and feel some kind of shared connection with them just because of our skin color, and I'm pretty sure most white people feel the same way.

I don't want to start a comment war about race or unconscious biases or injustice or whatever else. I just think that race is just a smaller part of your identity for white people than for many other people. (And I know the reasons why, so no need to comment. But it still doesn't change the end result.)

The point is, your race or ethnicity may be really important to you (and that's great!) but most white people couldn't care less about ours. I'm sure it was important back when the Irish and Polish and the Italians were all living in separate neighborhoods and wouldn't intermarry and stuff, but nowadays like 99% of white people just don't care. And we generally don't care what yours is either. Be nice to me and I'll be nice to you!

Will I tend to gravitate to people with a similar lifestyle as me? Maybe. But to me that means people who enjoy the same hobbies or movies or music as me, people who are in my classes and extracurriculars, not people who look like me or were raised in the same socio-economic class. I think this is a major misunderstanding between races these days.

How about we all just try and hold on to some of that First-40 spirit and make friends all the time with anyone and everyone!
