I'm scared to admit to believing in God because I don't want people to think that I'm dumb and judgmental; not intelligent or developed or progressive enough to go to Wash U. I consider the savior of my life to be my melody at midnight, my balm in times of trouble, my creator and refiner, and still.... I am ashamed.

I seek human approval so much that it scares me.
