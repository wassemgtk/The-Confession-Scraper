My friends justify littering, stealing food and stealing paper with "I pay $60,000 a year to go here."  Just because you are financially well-off does not entitle you to shitty behavior.  Yes, your tuition pays the wages of the maintenance workers, but that doesn't mean you get to make their jobs harder because you don't feel like throwing away your trash.  When you steal food, you make everyone else's meal plan more expensive.  When you steal paper, you make printing more expensive.  It's not about you, so start acting your age.
