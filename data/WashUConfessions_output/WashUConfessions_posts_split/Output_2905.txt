My boyfriend has a thing for feet. He gets excited kissing and massaging them (sweet bonus) and always notices when i wear cute socks, shoes, or tights. He originally confessed it to me as a "fetish" and asked me never to tell anyone, but honestly he's never done anything about it that seemed unhealthy or made me feel uncomfortable. He's always been very respectful, asks permission first, and the "weirdest" request he's ever made was for a foot job (like it's really so weird for a guy to want to be jacked off....). I've never found it particularly off-putting, but lately I've heard a lot people making wisecracks about "those crazy guys" who like feet as if suggesting they're all sociopaths/serial killers who are gonna chop 'em off at the ankles and keep them in a jar somewhere. C'mon guys, is this really such a weird thing? There have to be other, perfectly great guys out there who have "unusual" sexual attractions to parts of the body not typically associated with sex. I always want to speak up in defense of their sanity, but I don't want to risk my bf's anonymity, so can we all just agree to stop judging people for having different sexual preferences than our own? We're all a little weird in our own way.
