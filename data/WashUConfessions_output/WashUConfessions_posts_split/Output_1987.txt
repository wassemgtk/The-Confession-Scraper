I am a masculine gay guy and I'm having a hard time fitting in on campus. I know that there is a pretty decent sized LGBT presence on campus, but I don't feel that I have anything in common with them. I don't mind being gay, and I am completely at peace with it, but at the same time I don't identify with the mainstream gay scene/culture or the gay pride movement. I just feel like a regular person and being gay is part of that.

I watch / play sports, I'm into cars, and I have much more in common with most straight people than gay people, at least those that I've met here. I'm a stereotypical "jock" type of guy and people are almost always surprised when I come out to them. I have a lot of close straight male friends and am socially well adjusted, but I sometimes feel alone because I can't seem to find anyone else that's like me.

I'm attracted to guys that are also "stereotypically masculine" and I can't seem to find any of them. It would even be nice to have a gay friend that has a "stereotypically straight" sensibility and interests like me. I've met a handful of gay guys here and I honestly just couldn't see myself being friends with any of them. I have nothing against them, it's just that we're not similar at all. Please forgive me if this comes off as generalizing or homophobic - I'm really just trying to be as honest as I can.

It's harder to meet people like me because they're less present on campus, if they exist, and they don't make as big of a deal about being gay. A lot of them probably aren't even out. I don't really know why I'm writing this post or what I expect to get from it, but I guess it feels good to vent my frustrations. Aiight, you can go back to studying or getting high or whatever now
