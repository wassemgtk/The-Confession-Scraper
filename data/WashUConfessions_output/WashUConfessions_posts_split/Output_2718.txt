I feel like there's a flaw in the way fraternity rush works at our school. I rushed two fraternities last semester and didn't get invited into any closed events, but I also wasn't myself so I decided to rush again this fall. I found two fraternities (not the same ones from last semester) that I felt I could see myself in and liked the guys, but once again I didn't get invited to the closed events. I know there's politics involved and all, but I've noticed that there are a lot of people who get two or three bids to fraternities while so many other people don't get any at all. I know this isn't the case at other schools, where most people who rush end up getting a bid somewhere. Obviously there's selectivity and fitting in involved, but doesn't it hurt both parties if the same group of people are being pursued by a few fraternities? I feel like many more people end up getting rejected from Wash U Greek life than at most schools.
