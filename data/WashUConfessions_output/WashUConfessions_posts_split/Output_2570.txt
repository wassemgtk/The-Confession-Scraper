I confess that it bothers me to see kids in military uniforms walking around in an academic environment. I have no problem with them as individuals, but I would like to see ROTC asked to leave wash u. We should be focused on learning and not on militarism; by allowing ROTC on campus we permit an organisation responsible for much of the pain and suffering around the world (the US military) to be part of the face of our university. We allow an organisation that openly discriminates against trans individuals to be part of the face of our university. That isn't something I am comfortable with.
