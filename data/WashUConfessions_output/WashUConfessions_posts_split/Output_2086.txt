It pisses me off that whenever I go to SHS with an appointment, they are always late (the mental health staff). There are times when I wait 15-30 minutes just to get to my appointment and end up only having a 45-30 min session when it was supposed to be longer.
I understand that they are busy, but it also is a waste of time and money. I'm not getting better, my time for the appointment is being shaved off for the appointment, yet I still have to pay for the session in full.
I just want to get better, but this is not helping...
