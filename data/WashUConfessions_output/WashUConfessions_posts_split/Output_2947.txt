Please read this but do not post this: when people send in confessions saying that not one of their confessions has been posted- they do not want that posted. it is not a confession. they are just trying to tell you that you need to post things without choosing which are your favorite or however it is that you choose. I, personally, have submitted a number of confessions which have not been posted but were submitted because i NEEDED certain people to see them. I NEEDED them to understand how i was feeling during a certain period of my life and believe that if they see the post than they will understand what they did or what was going on with me. I also thought that if someone else saw it, and thought it was in reference to them, it could show them how they may have hurt someone in the past. Useing one of these "my posts never get posted" posts as one of the THREE that you post each day just takes power away from people who NEED something to be said.
