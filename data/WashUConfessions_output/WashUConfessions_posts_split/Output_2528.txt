I confess that my birthday is coming up in a week, and I am pretty sure I would have no one to celebrate it with. No friends, no gifts, no parties, no birthday surprises, as what have been in the past three years. I might get a few posts on FB pages and that's it. It sounds silly but I really want gifts...even if it's a note on my door or a thoughtful, long post or picture with a paragraph on my FB page...anything that is more than mere "HBD". From my past experience I know this is too much for me to ask. I have bought stuff I don't need (which I really shouldn't considering my budget) just because I want gifts so badly and giving myself gifts seems the most viable way for me to receive anything at all. I guess I'll have to spend my last birthday at Wash U crying in my own room thinking why am I such a freaking social failure. Usually it's on a weekday and I have excuses like everyone is busy with classes. But this year my birthday is on a weekend day. No excuses. And what's the difference. No one will remembers except myself.
