There's a WashU Confessions trend that I think we've all seen in the past few semesters. Here's an example.

Confession: "I hate sororities/fraternities because they are clique-y, based on arbitrary acceptance criteria, separate the WashU community, and are degrading to women." (3 likes)

Comment: "Frats/sororities are based on honor, brotherhood/sisterhood, philanthropy, etc. etc. and I can make whatever decision I want." (45 likes) [sorry I can't make the best argument for sororities/fraternities]

Now, I totally get where sorority and fraternity members are coming from. These organizations are a huge part of their lives and have, for the most part, been an educational and enriching experience. Also, it doesn't make much sense for someone to critique sorority/fraternity life if they have never been involved.

However, I think that a lot of people are incredibly frustrated about their perception of themselves as not being able to get into one of these organizations, a past rejection from an organization, or the spot in a friend's back-burner after that friend's acceptance into a sorority/fraternity (point: you can just try harder to keep in touch with that person; counterpoint: friendship is a two-way street and, especially in the early stages, people are expected to socialize more with their fraternity brothers or sorority sisters).

I don't think that the sororities/fraternities should take the blame for these things. I think, though, that we should acknowledge that many people harbor these feelings of frustration (not just the people that decide to post on WashU confessions) and that these feelings are completely valid (and shouldn't just be ignored). To quote Louis C.K., "When a person tells you that you hurt them, you don't get to decide that you didn't."

So what's the solution to this issue? I don't know. I would encourage sororities/fraternities to try to do something about the ill feelings besides biting back. Does anybody have any ideas/ comments / concerns/ different perspectives?

Also, before anybody comments, I am not part of a fraternity or sorority and this post is biased because of it. I'm sorry.
