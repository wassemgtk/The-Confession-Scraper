Confessions will be retiring within the next few weeks. 

This was a hard decision to make. It's been on my mind every day for months. This was a project that I poured a tremendous amount of time and energy into. Watching Wash U Confessions grow from a page that had been dead for months and back into to a flourishing community was a tremendous pleasure.

But I'm sad and relieved to say that this page has served its purpose and is ready for retirement. There will be more information to come briefly and I'm sure there will be questions - I will answer them with transparency and honesty because the community deserves that. 

Until then, washuconfessions.com will still be operational and I will serve with loyalty and dedication until the very end.

Yours Sincerely,
Admin
