Since I'm so far away from home, I confess that I'm nostalgic about southern cuisine. Some days, I'm so somber about 'bae' that I go to www.google.com/images and look up pictures of biscuits, gravy, and cornbread (among other viands) in order to assuage my pain. The people I've met at school so far, are pretty chill, but have yet to surpass the food's magnificence. Maybe one day I'll be okay, but until then...
