The way people are coming together right now, people walking the streets wearing running bibs, makeshift memorials, and moments of silence at sporting games, makes me proud to be a New Englander. People all over New England are showing so much support because the states are so small, that they identify Boston as their city. I would give anything to be home right now to be part of that support, and to be with my friends and family living in Boston. But I can't be with those at Boston College, Boston University, and Northeastern, who have friends in critical condition in hospitals. I can't be with my friends who got to mile 22, and never got to finish. It makes St Louis feel so far away and detached. The immediate damage may be finished, but we all need to still pray for Boston.
