I confess that I'm completely devoid of all motivation and purpose. My senior year of high school was probably one of the worst years of my life. I had a terrible summer right afterwards, where my long term boyfriend and I had a nasty breakup, and I worked nonstop to distract myself from the pain. I didn't get a chance to mentally recover, from the physical and mental damage of everything that happened during the previous year. Iwas so excited to go to school, and honestly I really like it at WashU. But its a shallow happiness; during the day I have fun: I've made lots of great friends and am involved in multiple activities I really enjoy. But as soon as I notice that I'm enjoying myself I feel my attention getting removed from reality, I feel purposeless. While I enjoy being around a lot of the friends I have made, I find myself not caring about my work, or finding any ambition whatsoever. And despite this, I've managed to do really well in all of my classes, and have a job that the version of me from two years ago would do anything to have. Yet I feel nothing. I fear that my emotions are slipping away. I have no desire to return to school after break, which is a shame and honestly surprises me greatly because I thought I was doing better. I just don't know what to do with myself. And I'm scared.
