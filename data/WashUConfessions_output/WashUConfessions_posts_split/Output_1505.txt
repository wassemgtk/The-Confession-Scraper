I have been quite worried, along with my dermatologist, that I had skin cancer.  Lab results came back today cancer-free!  I haven't been this happy/relieved ever.  The thought of having cancer has made the first part of the semester quite difficult, and I can't wait to enjoy the rest of the semester.
