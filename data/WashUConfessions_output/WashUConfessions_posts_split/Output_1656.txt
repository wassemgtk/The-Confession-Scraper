I work in the food service industry at a very popular restaurant near WashU and I know something that a majority of you do not-- WashU students have an incredibly bad reputation in the immediate area around WashU. We are known for being rude, never tipping, and we are oftentimes disliked by workers in this area. We have this reputation for a reason.

Remember that the people serving you food at the restaurants you frequent are people, too (some of us even go to WashU) and that when you behave like a douchebag, you are giving the entire student population at WashU a bad name.
