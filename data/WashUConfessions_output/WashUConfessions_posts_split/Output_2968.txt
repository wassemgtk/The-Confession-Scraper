Every "confession" now is a fucking self-righteous enormous essay from a soap box, so here's my short confession that actually meets the parameters of a "confession": at the end of last year I stayed in the dorms for a few days after finals, and I raided all the boxes of books and clothes that get donated to libraries, shelters, etc. for any that I would want. I'm not proud of it, but I also don't use this page to mentally jerk off until my holier-than-thou jizz lands in my mouth.
