I hooked up with my RA freshman year, and that was the closest I had ever come to losing my virginity. I didn't go all the way because I wanted to wait until marriage.

I passed up other opportunities for sex up until Senior year with my girlfriend, by which point I had become an atheist.

I wish I'd gone all the way with my RA so that I wouldn't have thought I had a reason to pass up on my other chances as a sophomore and junior to enjoy the sexual freedom college brings.
