I confess that I am a native bilingual, and one of the two languages is English. But I was not born and raised here. I am very much bothered, even offended, when people refer to me as an ESL. I might be a jerk but I just hate that label being connected with me. Yet I am afraid to confront people on that because I am afraid they would think that I'm some sort of hyper sensitive freak or I am discriminating or something. But being called as an ESL caused me a tremendous amount of discomfort and stress every time. Am I crazy or something? What should I do?
