For everyone out there looking for someone, my advice is don't be afraid to ask someone out. Chances are they will be flattered either way. And let's be honest, would you ever be mad at someone asking you out!? Probably not. This applies to both girls and guys. Girls, it's ok to ask guys out, we live in 2015. And guys, almost any girl would be overjoyed to be asked out. So, long story short, put yourself out there because you never know until you try.
