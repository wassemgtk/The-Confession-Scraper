When I read post #1856, I teared up a bit. I am a senior at WashU, and I was in a similar situation my junior year. My then girlfriend abused me constantly over that time. Originally, it was only slapping, but then she kept on escalating. I started getting bruises. I tried to tell my friends, but I couldn't, not after all the times we all laughed at the idea of women being able to physically abuse men. I didn't want them to think less of me. One time when we were working in the kitchen, I asked my girlfriend if she could finish cooking my egg while I used the bathroom. She said, "Do you think that women are only here to make men food?" I said no, but she grabbed the handle of the burning pan and pressed the bottom of the pan against my hand. I knew at the moment that it had gone too far and that I had to end the relationship. A few days later, I ended the relationship by a text message and I have been avoiding her ever since. Thank you author of post #1856 for giving me the courage to speak out.
