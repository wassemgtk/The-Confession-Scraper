Last night I let one of my friends mix a drink for me. It was one solo cup's worth that very obviously had soda in it and yet I got so drunk that I was still having vision problems 3 hours later. He told me there was only one shot in my cup. It tasted like more but I thought that was because I hadn't had a drink in awhile.

 I don't know what he gave me, but I think if I hadn't called my boyfriend when he left the room for a second he would have raped me. The guy I dated for most of freshman year physically abused me, and as a junior now I'd finally convinced myself I'd gotten over it to the point where I could trust guys again. Last night destroyed that. 

I don't know what I'm going to do about my friend or my relationships with guy friends. I also don't know how I'm going to survive class today because I feel horrible. Wish me luck!
