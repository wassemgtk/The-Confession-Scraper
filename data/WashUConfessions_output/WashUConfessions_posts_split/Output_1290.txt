y have noticed that the overall tone of Confessions has been changing over the past few months. 

When I started running this page, I tried to make it a place where people could be honest, funny, dark, quirky, etc. I wanted this page to give everyone a voice, but somewhere along the line Confessions got caught up in arguments and politics. 

If I don't post a confession arguing about some political issue, it's because Wash U Confessions isn't the right place for that. Each of these confessions hits about 3,000 news feeds and it would be irresponsible to anonymously promote a political agenda to such a large audience. Anonymous arguments only serve to divide the community and start hatred. I'm also tired of special interests groups trying to intimidate me into spreading their political agenda. It simply isn't going to happen anymore. 

More importantly, if you send in a confession about wanting to kill yourself and I don't post it, it isn't done out of malice - I can't emphasize that enough. Suicidal confessions trigger other people into sending similar confessions about suicide, and the problem snowballs out of control. Honestly, reading suicidal confessions and deciding it's best not to post them is a decision that I literally lose sleep over. 

I can't say that every decision I've made on accepting or rejecting a post was perfect. But after having gone through thousands of confessions I've started to get a feel of how a confession can affect the school, and this page shouldn't be negatively impacting the community. It simply isn't in the spirit of Confessions. 

If you have any feedback as to how Wash U Confessions has been lately, feel free to directly inbox this page on Facebook. I do remember people who have messaged me and what they say, and it goes into the decision-making of which confessions go through. 

Hope everyone's been enjoying the stellar weather!
