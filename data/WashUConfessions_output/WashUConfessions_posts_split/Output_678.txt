I am continually disappointed by the lack of respect WUSTL students have for sustainability initiatives on campus.  So many refuse to even take two minutes to learn the rules of waste collection.  Plastic utensils go in landfill!  Cardboard cereal containers are recyclable! None of us can make a difference alone, but together we can accomplish something and help our children's Earth, something that I hate to say our parents haven't done a very good job with either.  

Please, please, please take a minute just to think about why it is important to pay attention to all the little things that you can do to contribute to the cause of sustainability.  I know a lot of measures are a bit of an inconvenience, but they are nonetheless important, and you can help us, as a community, make a real difference.
