When I was rejected from a sorority I thought I was going to get into, it was crushing.  It's absolutely true that you shouldn't base all your self-worth on how you end up doing in rush, and of course Greek Life isn't the most important thing in the world (obviously). But for someone who's been going through a bad time, or who's always felt out of place at WashU and been seriously thinking of transferring, or who's always dreamed of getting into a sorority, or who sees all their good friends getting bids and anticipates their group of friends drifting apart, that one sorority's rejection can be the straw that breaks the camel's back. For me, getting into this sorority felt like my last chance to get into a solid group of friends in college, but then they said they didn't want me.  Did you ever get rejected from a college you thought you would get into? Or get told you weren't good enough to be someone's friend? It's real, and it hurts. So please stop telling people things like that their "priorities are seriously screwed up" - you don't know their circumstances and you haven't walked in their shoes. K?
