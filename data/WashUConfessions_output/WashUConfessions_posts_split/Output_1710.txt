Ever since I was a little girl I've always been told that you have to be in a relationship; that you can't just date around or it will be seen as promiscuous. And I went with it. I have gone from relationship to relationship, which is great, but now that I'm single again I wanted to explore my options. I'm having a good time and have met some amazing people, yet I can't help but feel guilty. I know it probably sounds stupid, but I've never casually dated before and I'm really nervous about it.
