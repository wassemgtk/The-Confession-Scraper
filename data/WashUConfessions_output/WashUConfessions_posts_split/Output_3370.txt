I told a professor today that there was an error in one of our class handouts online. His response was, "I don't recognize your face. You don't come to class. Do what you want, but I handed it out already." Then he scoffed and walked away. I sit in the back row. I like having digital copies of everything. I'm quiet. I'm plain. I know that. But I'm still a student. I go to class. And that hurt.
