I posted here before about my gf breaking up with me on Valentine's Day last year. She was an international student from China, and I don't mean for this to sound racist in any way (I apologize if it is), but I wonder: do folks in China not celebrate Valentine's Day?

P.S. to the OP of #2241, I guess this can join your top list of ridiculously stupid questions?
