Over break, I have occasionally volunteered to work for abandoned animals in my home country. Yesterday, I got a call from one of the staff from the animal protection center that they lack budget and facilities to keep abandoned animals (especially dogs). As a result, they will be euthanizing dogs every week. He asked me if I was willing to have more pets. However, I already have two dogs and am not in a situation to keep more. I was wondering if any of you (if I decide to bring one of those dogs from Asian animal center) are willing to save these dogs from death (through permanent adoption). They will be given for free (most likely).
