To be honest: I cut the line for Macklemore tickets too. The thing I'm happy about is that the people who didn't cut the line probably didn't have enough friends in front of them to cut. So you probably aren't that cool, which makes me happy you aren't going.... Sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do
