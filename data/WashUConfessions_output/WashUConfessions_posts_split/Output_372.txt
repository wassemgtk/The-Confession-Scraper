As a junior who is asexual, I still kinda hope I can give sex a try before I graduate.  But having no sex drive makes it difficult.  Other guys talk about sex a lot, so it's sorta like a really great movie everyone has seen but me, so when people talk about it I just nod and pretend I understand what it's all about.
