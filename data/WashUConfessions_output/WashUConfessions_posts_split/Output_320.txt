Before I transferred to Wash U, I was raped. My university at the time strongly pressured me not to go to the police, attempting to give me platitudes about how it would be easier to deal with in house. I chose to go to the police instead. Was it stressful, possibly traumatic? Yes. But what was worth more? My comfort through the investigation? Or the knowledge that I was protecting possibly hundreds of people from going through what I did? As for my rapist, he's now in jail. Had I chosen not to go to the police, he would still be on the streets, taking advantage of others.
