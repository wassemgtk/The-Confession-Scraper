While being home this weekend, I considered the idea of coming out to my sister that I am Bi. But at every opportunity that presented itself, I chocked and found it impossible to get the words out. I know she would accept me for who I am, and I feel like I am ready to tell her, but it feels as though there is a part inside of me that just wont let me get it out. It really hurts to keep this from someone whom I tell everything and someone I trust more than anyone.
