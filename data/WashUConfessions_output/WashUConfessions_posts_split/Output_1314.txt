I gotta say, I hate the idea of going to med school. It's something my parents are convinced that I should do, but ever since I came to Wash U, I have become more and more disillusioned with the medical field. It seems like there are too many people in it for the money and prestige that come with being a doctor. Many doctors game the insurance and medicare systems by performing expensive procedures that are unnecessary. When I graduate, I want to be free. I don't want to be a pawn in a flawed system and a slave to money.
