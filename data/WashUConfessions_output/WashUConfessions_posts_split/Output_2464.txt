I confess that I am taking a class with the most unforgettable professor I have ever met in my life this semester.  I understand that some people did cheat in his class before, which is absolutely intolerable.  However, his stereotypical and skeptical sentiments and "ridicules" against a certain group of international students in my class often create unnecessary intensity in class.  Often times I wanted to say something.  But I was too scared to offend the professor in front of the whole class.  Moreover, aside from his soul-crushing amount of workload, he distributes work unevenly.  For the most recent group project, without any explanation, he assigned the majority of the class with only one simple textbook problem, whereas the other two groups had to present on a whole case which involved reading pages and pages of worksheets.  Enough ranting.  I can't wait to get done with his class.
