I'm a guy and I hate rape culture, but not for the first reason you'd expect. Of course, I'm just as much against rape as the next person; anyone who does that to another human being deserves a punishment the darkest of minds can't concoct. I'm talking some serious medieval stuff or something. And to the victims, I don't mean to be selfish when I make my own personal complaint; my issue doesn't hold a candle to yours and I respect you for being the strong individuals you are. But I digress. 

To no one's fault but those guilty, the ubiquity of rape on this campus has made more people feel fear to falling victim. In turn, their fear has inspired fear in me when it comes to hitting on women. At a time, I did pretty well for myself socially. It use to be a numbers game; you play nice and eventually someone matches you, no shame in failing a few times. But now, you just can't get rejected without coming off as creepy, and with word spreading fast, I can't take the pressure of hurting my image like that. Seriously, I've digressed to my middle school self not knowing what to say because I want to be sure I don't overstep any boundaries. On top of it, I worked my ass off to get here, and while I treat women the best I can, I'm still in constant fear of my actions landing me in a courtroom. 

Bottom line, when it comes to hitting on women, I've become a huge pussy because of rape culture. So to the perves and predators out there, screw you guys. You're like the 14 year old who passes out in the port-a-potty at a tailgate, and gets tailgates banned for the entire university. Seriously, I know admin has to censor me, but fuck you.
