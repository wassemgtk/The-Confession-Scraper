In light of the recent Victoria's Secret "Perfect Body" campaign, I confess that the aversion to skinny women being called beautiful makes me feel hideous.  I have been a size 0, been called anorexic and referred to psychologists and eating disorder specialists for years.  I want to be thin and be able to love my body without feeling like others resent me.  I agree that all body types should be called beautiful, but I don't think thin women should have to be ashamed of themselves in order to achieve universal acceptance.
