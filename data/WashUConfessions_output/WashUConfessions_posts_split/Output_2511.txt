I confess that I feel like I have been body shamed about having facial hair so much that it's ridiculous. People make comments saying I either look like a middle school boy or look like I touch them, and I laugh a little and pretend it doesn't hurt, but it does.

We're all trying out new things for the first time, and I don't shame people for their choices. If I want to experiment and try to grow a little facial hair, please do me a favor and keep your negative comments to yourself.
