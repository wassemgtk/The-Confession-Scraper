I confess that professors need to remind their T.A's above all that a 4-6 page paper is a 4-6 page paper! Too many times T.A's circle statements with sufficient background evidence and ask for either too much elaboration or simply put "I disagree with your argument" because of some crazy study they read. I can't put a counter argument for every sentence. That would turn my 4-6 page paper into a 400 page Thesis or Dissertation and I am not writing one of those, you are!
