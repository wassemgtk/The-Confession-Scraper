I've been home for less than a week and I already miss WashU so much it hurts. I miss being able to be myself, I miss being treated with respect, I even miss the classes. I know I should feel lucky to have such a long winter break, but honestly I'm already counting down the days until second semester. WashU is a better home to me than my family's house will ever be.
