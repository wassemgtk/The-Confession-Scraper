As an alum, and I confess that I feel like WashU really was the best years of my life! There were struggleful moments and heaps of uncertainty, there was doubt and confusion, but actually thats just a part of life and alas you can't escape- you can only learn to deal (more) effectively. BUT, at WashU was a magical place, a place where everyone wants to help- not only peers but help global causes and the environment, promote justice for all people. There were resources for every occasion, there was food for every time of day, there were multiple buildings with really easy roof access. No school is perfect, but compared to anywhere else I've been this school is the most aware and concerned locale, a place where you can be listened to and have meaningful discussion. I love you WashU, I always will.
