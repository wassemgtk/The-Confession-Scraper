I'd like to apologize to those who were hurt by my confession, 3135. I wanted to express that some, though definitely not all, of the students seem to speak to people in minimum wage jobs at a distance, with a friendliness that seems more forced than genuine. 

I more wanted to encourage people to actually get to know people working here instead of keeping them at a distance and only saying the obligatory hello how are you without caring much about the answer. I phrased it badly,though, and I apologize.
