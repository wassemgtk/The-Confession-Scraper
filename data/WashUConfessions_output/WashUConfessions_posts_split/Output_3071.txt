Now that my horrid roommate has finally left for the year I can get this off my chest. First semester I was pretty sure that you had be swiping my alcohol and food. Food isn't that big of a deal but the alcohol was, in general, not that cheap. You had this "creative" plan where you would only grab the beer in the back or you would refill the hard stuff with water, as if I wouldn't notice 6 beers gone because the front row was in order. I confronted you about it a few times, but it was still a problem. Then, after Thanksgiving, I came back with some really nice imported beer my cousin had brought back for me and I specifically asked you to leave them alone. Next weekend comes and theres only 1 left. That was the last straw. I had to do something. When I can back from Winter Break i brought all the beer (about 45) that wasn't drank from my Memorial Day (7 months ago) and I would put that in the fridge. Also, I replaced the hard alcohol with pickle juice. That's right, you've been drinking old beer and pickle juice (I hid my stuff in a cooler under the bed). I'm pretty sure you figured out the pickle juice was pickle juice after you had 3 shots of it, but I digress. I hope you learned your lesson champ.
