Today, I randomly approached a group of people for help on homework because I had overheard them talk about a certain problem that I was having trouble with as well, but when I asked them about the problem, they just gave me really confused looks and omg I'm so embarrassed and now I just want to apologize to them for being weird and kind of creepy. all i wanted was help on homework i didn't mean to make them uncomfortable sorry
