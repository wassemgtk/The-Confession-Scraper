Stumbling home at 3am, I was taking a snapchat of Mudd Field to show how our campus goes to bed early.  When I looked down from my snap, I saw that I was about to step right on these two people laying in the middle of Mudd Field.  I apologize for terrifying you, I applaud you for proving me wrong, and I will remember you guys forever!
