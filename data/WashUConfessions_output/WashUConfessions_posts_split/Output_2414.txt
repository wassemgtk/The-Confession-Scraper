There has been a lot of talk about racism on here recently, and what I'd like to say is that while the infamous #1341 certainly isn't %100 correct about the black students on campus, I can understand his/her sentiment that lead to the post.  When any activists on campus (regardless of race, gender, or cause) become so deeply invested in issues that seem small (whether they are actually small or not doesn't much matter), it can be perceived almost as these activists "crying wolf."  I think that were they to focus their attention on a smaller number of really big issues, these groups would have more clout on campus.  When they react so strongly to things that I or other classmates might not even notice, they come off as overreacting.
That being said, I believe that everyone should have the right to express themselves, in whatever form that takes.  If an event upsets you, say something about it, do something about it.  But at the same time, not everyone else can be expected to express themselves in the same way, nor can they be expected to take issue with all of the same things and hold the same ideals.  Wash U students are all passionate about something, but they will never all be passionate about the same thing.  We will disagree, argue, and protest.  Just remember that while you have a right to protest for your side, so do the people you are protesting against.
