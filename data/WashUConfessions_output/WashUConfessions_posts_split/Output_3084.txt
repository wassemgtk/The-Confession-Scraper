I have tourettes. Ive never told anyone here and i have this new tic where i hot my legs with a closed fist as hard as possible. My legs are completely bruised and it hurts to walk. I just want someone to talk to about all this, to distract me, and to be able to stop me when they see me going to tic. I just want to talk to my roommates about it but they aren't exactly speaking to me. Its just been a really tough and lonely semester
