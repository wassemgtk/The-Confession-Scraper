I saw the Wash U Confessions post about Cheeseology closing and how kind they are as employers, and inspired, me and my friends went to eat there. We showed them the Confessions post, and it made them so happy to know that we cared. I left them a 100% tip, with the hashtag #GiveCheeseGiveBack. I'm only posting this on here because I really, really want this to become a thing. Let's come together and show this business that we appreciate all that they've done for us!!
