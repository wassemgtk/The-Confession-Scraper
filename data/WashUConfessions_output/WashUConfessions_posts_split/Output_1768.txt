I confess that I'm appalled at how much self worth so many supposedly smart people have tied up in the Greek popularity contest. You'd seriously just drop out if you don't get into a sorority? Wow. Just wow. Greek life isn't the only way to experience college and it's not the end of the world if you don't get in.
