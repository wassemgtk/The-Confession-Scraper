My best friend came out recently and I don't like who he's become. I couldn't care less that he is gay, but it is like he is trying to fit himself into this stereotypical little box and has become completely shallow and crude. I don't know if I should say something (maybe his new personality is just a phase/part of his finding himself) or just realize that he is not the same kind and caring friend that he always was and cut my losses. I just want some advice because I feel bad going to any of our mutual friends about this. What do you all think?
