To the person who posted the "wambulance" comment: 1). STFU 2). Way to completely ruin a Modern Family reference. Congrats because you just won the gold in ass-holery. 3). I hope the day never comes when someone publicly tries to invalidate your feelings about something that could have been a traumatizing experience.
