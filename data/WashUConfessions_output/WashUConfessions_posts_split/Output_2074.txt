As a member of a Wash U greek organization, I confess that greek philanthropy at this school is despicable. Let me give you a picture of how greek philanthropy works. Every greek organization puts on philanthropy events for the other greek organizations and for the student body in general. These are meant to raise money for good causes and promote the fraternity/sorority name. The main reason a greek organization participates in these philanthropy events is so that the other greek organizations will, in turn, participate in their event. Each event has an entry fee (where the money raising comes in), so each greek organization requires members to pay a certain amount in dues to cover these participation fees. So essentially, all of the money has already been raised. The philanthropy events just shuffle it all around. It's a big circle jerk where each greek organization donates a little bit of money to each of the other philanthropy causes. Why can't these organizations just use dues to donate directly to their own cause? That would save time, effort, and (most importantly) money. If these organizations weren't so concerned with looking charitable, they could actually be much more charitable.

And Thurtene...that's the worst part of it all. Greek organizations raise so much money during the year so that they can pay for Thurtene. But Thurtene refuses to tell people how much money they actually raise for charity, begging us to ask if the actual dollar amount is just so embarrassingly small, they don't want people to know--I mean, every other charity in the world loves to brag about how much money they raise. So next time you "donate" money to greek philanthropy, just know that you're mostly donating to the reputation of a bunch of privileged Wash U students, and some portion also gets lost to putting on a carnival.
