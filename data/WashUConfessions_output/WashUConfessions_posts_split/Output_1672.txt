I've submitted several things that didn't get submitted. I think its for the best, I wasn't in a good place when I wrote them, and just writing it helped. Honestly I'm not totally sure what makes the difference between getting posted or not, but just writing stuff on this black box and knowing someone reads it is enough. I'm kinda glad no one else saw them.
