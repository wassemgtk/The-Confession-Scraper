Coming into college, I was against drinking and promised myself I wouldn't do it (personal decision, I am completely fine with others drinking). However, like many others, I fell into the party scene as a way to make friends. While I seem happy at parties, I think I am starting to fall into a depression because of how quickly I abandoned my morals.
