An extremely intoxicated man tried to break into our apartment tonight. We called 911 and the cops took care of it.... but it took them 10 minutes to get here. I used to tell myself that if I was being attacked I would get to my phone and call 911 and everything would be fine. Yet after tonight I realize that I would be raped and dead before the cops ever showed up (if they could even get into my apartment).  Confession: If my housing lets me I'm buying a gun. I no longer feel safe with 911 and my cell phone. #notgoingtobeavictium
