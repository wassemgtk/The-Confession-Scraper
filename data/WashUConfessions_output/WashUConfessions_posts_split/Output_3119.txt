I confess that I am ashamed of the wealth of this school when I look at the facades at Thurtene. To clarify, I am not talking about the carnival part itself. Though I am skeptical about the honorary, I recognize the good that the carnival aspect (the rides, funnel cakes etc) do for the school regarding community relations, and that the carnival is a long tradition on campus. The facades are a disgusting display of wealth and should be disbanded for the coming year. I am a member of one of the groups that builds a facade and it is an incredible waste of resources and man power. To begin each facade costs and extraordinary amount of money. We spend hours and hours building them (often neglecting school work and other responsibilities) and then we just tear them down. If we as a community spent our time building houses in intercity St. Louis rather than building them for three days and then tearing them down, we could do a lot of good for the city.
