I confess that I'm still in the winter break mindset. This past week I've torrented and watched a movie every single night. Most of the movies were from the Oscar nominations- Gone Girl, Theory of Everything, Grand Budapest Hotel, etc. (just to name a few I liked). I wasted the rest of my time on the internet. I've also gotten 10 hours of sleep every night for the past week. I honestly don't know when my mind will want to do work again.
