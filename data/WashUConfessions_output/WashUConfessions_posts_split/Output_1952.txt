I might be taking a medical leave of absence next semester. I'm terrified, as — practically speaking — I have so many commitments next semester that if I leave, I am letting down a lot of people. I know mental health is important, but I really don't want to let everyone know that I'm having such a hard time to the point where I am becoming a threat to my own safety. Also, I fear the day that someone else sees me in one of my bad panic attacks. In addition, I'd need to put in an extra year to graduate, and what would medical schools/graduate schools think with a a lot of repeats (for this semester's work) and MLUA on my transcript?
