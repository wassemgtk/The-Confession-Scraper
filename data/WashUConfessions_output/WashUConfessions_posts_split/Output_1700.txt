I KNOW that grass doesn't magically go from haystack yellow to emerald green overnight, so I'm guessing the groundskeepers spray it with some paint before the pre-frosh kiddies start visiting in March/April. I really want to know if it's just straight up Home Depot paint they spruce up the coloring with or some insane dog poop fertilizer. Either way, sitting in the grass has sorta lost its appeal for me.
