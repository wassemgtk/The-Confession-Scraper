Omg okay- to the prefrosh who are concerned about their decision to commit here based on this page: I've written posts here criticizing WashU, dealing with depression/anxiety, and being super stressed out. I also would 100% commit to WUSTL if I could do it all over again. I call out the problems *because* I love and care about this university and want to see it do better, because I believe it can. It's not perfect. Just like people criticize America without hating the country and wishing they'd been born somewhere else. And while yes, support for mental health here has it's own array of problems that could be improved, there are people at this university that care tremendously about supporting students, and I can't imagine where I would be if I didn't have this amazing community surrounding me.

Also fuck finals.
