I confess that sometimes I feel so alone even though I'm in a sea of people. I feel like everyone around me has made stronger friendships and connections than I have and I don't know if I'll be able to continue making new friends.
I wish I knew how to form stronger connections with people so that it doesn't always feel like I'm more invested in the relationship than the other person, because that is starting to take its toll on me. I fear I'll eventually just shut myself out to avoid the pain of being shut out by others.
