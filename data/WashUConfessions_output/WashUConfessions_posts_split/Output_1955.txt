I confess that I often feel like unpopular opinions aren't accepted in the Wash U community. As the admin said, the veil of anonymity this page offers is one of the few outlets people may have. And it's important to understand the difference between having an unpopular or minority opinion and having an opinion that's racist, homophobic, etc. That's not what I'm talking about. WashU doesn't have a welcoming outlet for real discussion, just what's politically correct. There's a difference between healthy debate and open dialogue and what so frequently happens on campus. Many of the so called open dialogue events that happen at Wash U represent minorities of race or gender or something but not necessarily minority of opinion. If people don't feel welcome to share all sides of an issue, we won't grow as a community. Think about this: if people with other opinions than your own are afraid to speak their mind, you'll never have the opportunity to change theirs or yours.  Intimidation is not the answer.
