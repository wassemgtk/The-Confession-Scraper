I'm going to start off this confession by stating that I am very liberal, very much in support of the protests, and very much in support of fighting systemic racism and injustice in America. I am tired of seeing ignorant and racist posts and comments on my Facebook newsfeed.

However, I do not agree with how these issues have been handled on campus, and especially on Wash U Confessions recently. Right now, we are not fostering an environment for open discussion or cooperation, which is what we need now more than ever. At a school like Wash U, where every person is intelligent and has thoughts and ideas, I believe that it is absolutely unacceptable to shut down the opinion of any single student without first giving them a chance.

I fully believe that people can be against the protests, and even in favor of Darren Wilson, police, etc., without necessarily being racist. While I strongly disagree with them, I will never immediately label or judge someone for their opinion without hearing their reasoning first. Not understanding where someone is coming from GOES BOTH WAYS. It is unfair to not hear someone out NO MATTER WHICH SIDE THEY ARE COMING FROM.

I am proud of our community for creating such a sense of activism on campus, but so disappointed and fed up with the way that many students act toward anyone who doesn't immediately or outwardly agree with them.

And now watch me promptly be attacked for even daring to post this.
