I wish I could just "pray the gay away" because I can't choose between devastating my super Christian parents or never being with someone I love. I lose either way. My parents seriously believe that being gay is a choice. I'll admit, I make some pretty bad decisions, mostly food related, but I'd sooner eat a bad batch of guacamole and have the shits for 16 consecutive days than choose to be in a lifelong battle with myself over how some dumb girl makes my heart beat faster than Chris Hemsworth does.

Honestly if I could choose, I'd choose to be straight. But for the first time ever I confess that I'm not, and it sucks. But it'll probably get better. But it sucks right now so I kind of just want to curl up in a ball and eat a block of cheese or something.
