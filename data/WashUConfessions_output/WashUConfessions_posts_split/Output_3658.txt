I want to wait until marriage to have sex. I'm proud that I prioritize respect and probability of success over instant gratification, but I also know I'm in the minority. In this prevalent hook-up culture, I have no way to express interest in a dis-ordinary way. Dates aren't for getting to know someone anymore, nor do they really even exist. I'm honestly a catch, but it's gonna be awhile till a girl figures that out, because I have no way to initiate the type of relationship I want with anyone I don't already know well. I can't help but feel I'm not in the wrong.
