I confess that I recently had my first counseling appointment through shs. The issue for which I decided to go is not pertinent to this confession, but I wanted everyone who has posted on here about needing some kind of help to know that it was a genuinely good experience. My day started off pretty terrible but after the appointment I felt a lot better. I really encourage everyone to take advantage of that resource if you feel like you need it. It's really hard to ask for help, but getting help is so worth it. Taking care of yourself is worth it. You are worth it.
