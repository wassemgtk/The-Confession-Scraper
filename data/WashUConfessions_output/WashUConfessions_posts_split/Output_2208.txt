I really want to deactivate from my sorority, but I feel like I would disappoint and let down so many people (friends, parents, my little). I'm also a senior, so part of me thinks I should just stick it out til I graduate in May, but aside from the few close friends I have, I don't know if it's worth it to stay. I don't know what to do. Any advice?
