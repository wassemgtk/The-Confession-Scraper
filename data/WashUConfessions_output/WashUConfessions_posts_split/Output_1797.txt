I confess that I was very excited for my first year of college but I felt incredibly lonely this past semester. It's been hard for me to make friends and after coming home and seeing some old friends and family, I'm dreading going back. I really think I would love WashU if I could meet some people I click with, but right now the idea of returning and being alone sounds terrible. I am not even sure how to approach people but I just don't want to be as lonely as I felt all of last semester. I've definitely missed the comfort and familiarity of my family and friends back home.
