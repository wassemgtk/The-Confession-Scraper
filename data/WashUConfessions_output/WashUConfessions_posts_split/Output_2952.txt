Tonight (this morning) I got home at 4 am and honestly that has just become the norm this semester. I genuinely envy people who manage to get above 3 hours of sleep every night because for me and others in my major the work flow is literally without end and sleep has become less of a priority and more of a privilege. I don't understand peeps who can (in good conscience and without having to worry about anything looming over the immediate horizon) just watch a movie or play a video game or go away for a weekend or whatever, and then still get all their work done and get enough rest every night. Dang, man. I don't think I've seen my room mates in like 3 days. I wish I could say that's the longest period of time that that's been the case. Also because I have no time to go anywhere else I've begun to just eat Subway almost every night and Subtember ended last week. Womp.
