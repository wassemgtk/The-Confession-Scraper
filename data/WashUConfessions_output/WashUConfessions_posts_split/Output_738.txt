So I have a steady long-distance boyfriend, whom I've been with for four to five years now. I've never been with anyone else. Is it bad that I sometimes wonder...? There's this guy here on campus who I really like/have a slight crush on. I feel guilty for even thinking it, but I just wish I could have more experiences with other guys.
