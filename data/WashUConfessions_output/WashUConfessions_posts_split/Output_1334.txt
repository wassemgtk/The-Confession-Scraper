I realized this morning that the only reason I get up in the morning is because of obligation; I used to be able to tell myself things like, "You get to study at one of the best universities in the US," "You might learn a new way of thinking today, maybe make a ground breaking personal discovery," "You're so lucky/privileged," and to take advantage of this first rate education. Generally, learning things is cool and fun, but that whole outlook hinges on wanting to learn, and learning being a good thing. I came to WashU happy to learn and ready to do it, and now I don't think I want to anymore. Learning is still useful, but not fun. I hate that I used to love some subjects and appreciated learning about them, appreciated what they had to offer, but a lot of those loves are gone because of how stressful learning is here.

A number of professors have told me that I shouldn't be so concerned about grades, and to just make sure I learn the material. Maybe I'm being obtuse, but yeah, I like challenging material. It's interesting. I want to learn about it. I also think it would be awesome if I could just learn the material without worrying about the class kicking my ass so much that I started to hate the entire process and its fruits. Bio happens to be a great example. The problem with an intro-level weed-out course is that if you hate the course, you don't know if you hate the material or the class. If you fight through it and get to upper-level bio courses (reportedly easier), then you might finally discover that you hate biology, not just the weed-out nature of past classes.

That's just one isolated example, but the trend is the same: my happiness is competing with my potential for success (and success is still defined by my GPA), and I don't think it's worth staying here for that. I know I'm #blessed, but it sure as hell doesn't feel like it sometimes. I just want to learn without the question, "What did I get on that?" occupying more of my mind than the material for the class.
