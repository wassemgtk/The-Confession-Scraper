Some people complain about Wash U Confessions being too depressing or candid or what have you, but I confess that I love how open this page has become.
I think it speaks more for the school that we have such an open forum for all sorts of discussion rather than having a watered down page full of bullshit confessions like "tall girl in library ur hawt date me plz ;)))"
