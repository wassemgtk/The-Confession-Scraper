Cannabis sativa is my antidepressant and cannabis indica is my sleep aid. My confession is that I can't function without them. I'm not addicted, but I'm not happy and will spend entire nights awake in bed without grass, and this was a problem before I even knew what weed smelled like.
I guess I kinda needed to get this off my chest; I don't want people think I'm a dependent loser or something.
