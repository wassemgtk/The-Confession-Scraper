Today I was told by a fellow student to "check my privilege". This student has no idea where I come from, and I have only known her for two weeks, so I thought I would share a little background about myself. I was born to a single mother in an emergency room in South Boston. I have never known my father due to the fact that he has only been out of prison for six weeks of my 22 year long life. My mother raised me alone, on top of working 60 hours a week of minimum wage jobs just to keep a roof over our heads and food on the table. Even that was not enough. We were forced to illegally live in an abandoned building for a year when we were evicted from our apartment in 2006. I grew up not knowing a single person besides my teachers that had attended college. I had to work my ass off to get in to Wash U, and I don't like to be told that I am "privileged" by a girl that has more shoes in her closet than I have owned in my entire life. I am asking everyone who reads this post to stop using the phrase "check your privilege", because you just sound privileged and snobby yourself.
