Confession #1553 really boosted my confidence as a black woman on this campus. I confess that Ive always felt an insecurity about being black and have always assumed that Im unappealing. Im curious if other black girls have felt the same way but i have never asked any of my friends... but usually if i ever find any guy attractive I conclude that id never have a chance simply because im black. I think it's all a result of where and how I was raised... but idk if im the only one who feels this way..
