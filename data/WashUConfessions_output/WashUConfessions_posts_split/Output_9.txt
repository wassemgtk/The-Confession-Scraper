The love of my life broke up with me a few weeks ago.... It's really torn me inside out. I now write letters to her. I don't intend to ever show her those letters, but I share them in a folder that I would use to send her stuff. She rarely uses it, but deep down I hope that she finds them sometime, even if it is years from now. I loved talking to her and now that I lost her as my best friend I just letters. Most of them are stupid, just talking about what I am doing or what I did, but they remind me of the time I spent with her and I feel better. They wont change anything, but they reflect how she changed my life for the better, and even though we have broken up, I wish her the best of luck. Sorry for rambling, but I just had to share with someone
