I have Celiac disease. As great as Wash U is about dietary restrictions, it really sucks not to be able to take advantage of all the free food there is on campus and it can make it hard to relate to/hang out with my friends. They don't mean to do it but anytime they talk about trying out a new restaurant I have to check out the gluten free options and more often than not I can't eat there. I don't want to make it a big deal by saying something especially because I want them to have fun and do what they want, but everytime somebody mentions free food, or going out for dinner, or really anything about food it makes me feel (unintentionally) excluded.
