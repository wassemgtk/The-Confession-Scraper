I was a total asshole freshman year. I made terrible decisions, caused problems that could have been avoided and overall just acted like a total dick. Last year I had a major awakening and thanks to my roommate at the time, went through one of the biggest psychological changes of my life, and even though now I'm a much better person, I feel like I cant escape the stigma of freshman year. To top it off, I have a severe inferiority complex which leaves me feeling extremely depressed at times. Some days I can hardly get out of bed.
