Every time my parents see me, they question why I'm not dating anyone and pressure me to think about marriage. My mom keeps telling me I should lose weight, dress better, and wear more makeup/jewelery and that that would "attract all the boys". I don't think that's the problem, I think the bigger issue is that I'm not that interested in a relationship. However, I feel like I keep disappointing my parents and it is becoming increasingly tempting to just date *someone* so that they'll stop being upset.
