I know that I shouldn't base my worth off of perceived sexual prowess or aptitude with "the ladies" but godamnit I don't know what to do. I feel like some sort of weird loser who who will probably spend my life alone or worse latch onto the first girl who shows me affection. It's like there was this period of life where you learn how to interact with the opposite sex that I just straight up missed and it kind of sucks.
