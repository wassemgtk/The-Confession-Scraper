To all the people who feel as though they have no friends, are getting overwhelmed by work, and are extremely homesick: everyone starts off that way. What happens next depends on what you do about your situation. I don't do the casual Friday nights' drinks & hook-ups, which definitely isolated me at first, but I soon found a large group of friends who I can always count on for a good time. I met these friends in TA/RPM/office hours and extracurricular activities/cultural societies. Once I clicked with a few people, our mutual friendship network grew, and soon, I had a full-fledged family here at WashU.
In regards to school work, only take on what you can handle: you are in full control of the classes you sign up for. And sometimes, taking care of yourself (sleeping, personal time off, cleaning) magically improves your grades as well as your state of being. When you study, just focus on studying; when you take a break, forget about the work you have to do. Keep in mind that everyone here at WashU is smart, so don't let comparison steal your self-worth. Sure, sometimes you won't get the grade you want-- but in the end, your college experience is a whole lot more than your GPA.
