I know everyone has a different opinion on what actually happened to Mike Brown, but here's the reality:  NO ONE AT WASH U ACTUALLY KNOWS WHAT HAPPENED.  So stop demonizing each other about what they think happened.  Take a deep breath and chill.  Love your fellow students and be kind. The media wants to see hatred and division, so lets beat them by giving them the exact opposite.
