I wish for once someone would make me a priority. You know, like when you're going to hang out, or study, and I'm a friend that you haven't hung out with in a long time. I don't want to always have to ask to come along. I know I'm not memorable, but it could be nice if people remembered your help without reminding them, instead of always being busy, or putting other friends first. I know it's unreasonable to ask to make a choice between friends, and I don't want to force you to choose, but I would prefer once in a while to be the one you ask to go study or hang out.
