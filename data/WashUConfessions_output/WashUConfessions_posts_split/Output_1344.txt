I'm the child of immigrant parents.  They've always pushed me to work very hard, emphasized the importance of education, blah blah blah the usual.  In addition to this, my mom rarely expresses pride or affection or really any positive encouragement to me (or my siblings) of her own volition. You know, a fairly typical immigrant-parent situation.

The last time I remember her really feeling proud of me, letting me know she was proud of me, was when I graduated high school. That was four years ago. Doesn't happen much.

But. Two years ago I started ending phone calls with her saying "I love you" to which she awkwardly replies "I love you too." And tonight she said "I love you" to me first.  That's the first time I remember her saying that to me without me having to say it first since I was in elementary school.

Dad's turn next.
