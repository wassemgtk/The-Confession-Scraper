I'm still attracted to my RA. At first I thought it was just the excitement of being in a new place with new people, but even now that everything has calmed down I find myself wanting to spend more  time with him. I know that there are certain boundaries that shouldn't be crossed, and I would agree that it would be inappropriate for an RA to have relations with a resident, but damn. I really feel like we get along well and I want to know more about him, but at the same time I feel like being around him more is just making it worse. I don't know what to do.
