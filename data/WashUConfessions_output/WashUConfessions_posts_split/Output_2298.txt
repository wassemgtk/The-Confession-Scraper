I confess that I am against the protest going on at SLU, as well as anyone here at WashU that is still defending Vonderitt Myers, a man who evidence now shows is guilty of shooting at the police.

I have many friends that support this movement, and I sympathize with them, as well as the countless others that want nothing more than to be able to feel safe in their communities. But Vonderitt Myers was not an innocent bystander that was attacked by vicious police. He's not a martyr. He's a criminal that purposely chose to shoot at a police officer, and I cannot support anyone who stands behind him.

We should all be able to live without the fear of being targeted by those police that are meant to protect us. But what this movement fails to realize is that the police act the way they do because they too are scared. They're scared that they could be on a routine patrol and be suddenly shot at and killed solely because they're a police officer. They're scared because they walk by crowds of people everyday that want them dead. They're scared that one man with a gun can take them away from their families in an instant. People like Vonderitt Myers only make that fear stronger. That is why Myers is a detriment to this movement, and anyone who wishes real progress to be made should denounce him and his actions.
