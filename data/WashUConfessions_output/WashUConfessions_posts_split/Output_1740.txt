I remember at my very first activities fair, someone was in the middle of the path handing out small strips of paper. It listed the time and place of a coming out event. I looked at that paper a lot. At first I had every intention to go, but I became increasingly anxious thinking about it. The day came and I was in the middle of some outing, bonding with the new people who were my floormates. I decided to stay with the floor.

Sometimes I think about emailing Open, or coming out to friends. My fear of opening up to new people or not receiving the support I need still overwhelms me. But I wanted to thank the person who handed me that paper slip. Even though I didn't do anything, I know I could have. I felt empowered then.
