I am a Libertarian, and I am consistently attacked because of my political views on this campus. When I voice my support of second amendment rights, I get dismissed as a supporter of mass shootings. When I express my support of polygamy marriage rights, I am dismissed as a sexist. Seriously, If you support the legalization of gay marriage you should also support the legalization of polygamous marriage. Liberals love to bash people like me, but they fail to realize their own hypocrisy while doing so. The government is robbing us blind and spending our hard earned tax dollars on programs that are inefficient and outdated. My ideology is currently in the minority, but more and more people identify as libertarian every day. It may be easy to gang up on us now, but there will come a day when libertarians control the government. hopefully that day does not come after the United States has completely sold its soul to China. Libertarianism is not perfect, same as any other ideology, but I am disappointed that intelligent Wash U students discredit me before they even try to learn more about my ideas.
