I've recently taken up Insanity, but haven't been in good enough shape to do the entire videos. Today, after a few days of getting my butt kicked, I realized that all the "first half" of the Insanity videos consist of, is a warm-up and stretch. All this time, I've been lying on the floor, a hair's breadth away from puking,  just from the stupid warm-up.
