I can't deal with feeling like I'm the only one of my peers with their shit together. I suffer from severe anxiety and chronic depression and part of freshman year was an absolute living hell. I was happy when I partied on the weekends, but I was so anxious that I was exhausted all the time and spent every bit of free time sleeping. I ended the semester with my GPA at 2.85. After having the biggest emotional breakdown of my life before Thanksgiving, I was determined to make next semester better, which it was, but my problems still persisted and I still slept all the time. I went into this year hopeful, but so far history is repeating itself. I still don't have the slightest clue what I'm doing and it feels like my life is falling apart in front of my eyes and that there's nothing I can do about it. Everyone around me seems to have this college thing down pat; three semesters in, and I honestly have no idea what I'm doing. The pressure of making my own decisions, and being so far from home is really taking its toll. I'm going home soon, and I told my father I wanted to have a conversation about transferring to a closer school. I've never contemplated killing myself, nor do I plan to contemplate it, but with bad day after bad day and just constantly being sad, I start to see how some people might find it alluring. I don't want to talk to someone I don't know at SHS, and I don't want to burden my friends, but it's just so hard to keep this inside all while still trying to appear sane. I just want someone to tell me they care.
