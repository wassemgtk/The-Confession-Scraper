Dear Freshmen,

Your time at WashU will be pretty fun, and I'm sure you've already been enjoying the various off-campus and fraternity parties (and even dorm parties) you've been invited too/showed up en mass when one person on your floor found out. Understand this very clearly: whether it's a fraternity house or an off-campus apartment, the people hosting are inviting you, complete and total strangers they will most likely never know, into their homes, where they live, work, study, and commune with friends. 

Not only did they invite you into their homes, but they are providing you with free alcohol and a place to dance and play games with your friends. That being said, STOP STEALING OUR SHIT. Every year, freshmen act like it's hilarious to steal perople's personal affects, the same people who have invited you into their homes. You might think "Oh it's just a shot glass", but that shit has sentimental value, a reminder of a family trip taken or time spent abroad. For the latter, those small trinkets are irreplaceable.

Sincerely,
Everyone who isn't one of you thieving bastards
