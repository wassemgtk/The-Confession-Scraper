OK premeds let's get bitchy and back it up with numbers.

It's total fucking bullshit that WashU has a premed attrition rate of ~2/3  and even among the people who stick it out only a small fraction make GPAs competitive for the top tier of med schools. (Yeah, we're good at getting people in somewhere and there is a small WashU bump for midlevel schools, but places like WashU Med, Penn, Harvard have no tolerance for lower numbers and accept classes with 3.9 median science GPAs. A mid 3.X is lethal; of the people accepted to WashU Med last year, only 10% had a 3.7 or lower).

Now I recently got curious and used the GPA/MCAT grid data in the Prehealth Handbook and AAMC Table 24 to try and see just how much Wustl students get fucked by being pitted against each other for limited high grades instead of against nationally average students. Guess what? When you approximately line up the two populations' performance on the MCAT (the Great Equalizer!) you see that WashU GPAs are lower by AT LEAST 0.6, which in the realm of premed GPAs is the difference between competitive for the best schools and barely competitive anywhere!

Extra bonus:

Nationwide the ratio of 3.8+ GPA / 36+ MCAT is 3.2
At Wash U the ratio is 0.7
That's right! We have more people scoring 97th+ fucking percentile on the MCAT than being awarded strongly competitive grades.

So, in conclusion, it makes no sense to grade harshly and weed out the number of premeds we do. We really need to start inflating the hell out of our grades Harvard/Brown/Rice style! I know I'll tell my siblings to seriously consider the scholarship to a decent state school if they plan to play the premed game - numbers just matter too much.
