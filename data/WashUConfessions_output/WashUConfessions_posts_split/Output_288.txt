I find it amusing, really, how media portrayals don't bear witness to real life. I'm conservative, and yet 99 percent of conservatives I've met are fine with who I am. But I'm also gay, and a good chunk of the gay community that I've met is not. I guess it just goes to show that social conservatism is not nearly as widespread as it might seem.
