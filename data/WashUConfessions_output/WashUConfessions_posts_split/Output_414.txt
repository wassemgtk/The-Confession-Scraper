A response to #3572, and anyone else who feels similarly.
I go to the gym a lot. This is anonymous, so there's no reason to boast, but I'd like to think that at this point--after a lot of hard work over the past few years--I'm one of the "fit guys" in the weight room. So here's my confession:

If you're overweight, weenie-thin, or new to fitness... I *want* you in the gym. I *want* you to take up space on the oly platform. Heck, make me wait my turn for the squat rack! Every single person in that gym, even that guy who makes muscle-ups look easy, started with baby weights. Nobody knows "gym stuff" from birth, and we're all continuously learning. If I see you in the gym, I'm mentally cheering you on--and honestly, I'll bet most of the other "fit people" in the gym are too. We want you to succeed! Just by going to the gym, you're doing something harder and braver than most people ever do, and that's rad.

I don't mean to erase your feelings, #3572. If you're afraid of going to the gym, that's valid, and real, and okay. But for what it's worth...you're strong, and you're awesome, and I want you to kick ass. You have people in your corner. :)
