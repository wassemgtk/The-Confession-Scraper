I am legitimately afraid that graduation in May will be interrupted or disrupted in some way. I draw this fear from what happened at the end of graduation in December. Graduation isn't just important to me, it is a significant day for everyone who helped me get this far. It means the world to my parents. And it is so sad that a student like me should have to fear that a special day like the one coming up in May might be used as a platform to protest ferguson/police brutality/race issues. It isn't the time or place, and I just wish my fellow students could be counted on to be on their best behavior for just 1 day. I called my parents today to warn them that it is likely some sort of protest/chant thing will occur, and it really broke my heart to tell them that they special day they are flying here for might be marred by the actions of a few, likely with the approval (or at least silence) of the university.
