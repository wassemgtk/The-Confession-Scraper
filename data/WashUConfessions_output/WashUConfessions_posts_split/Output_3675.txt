Caught my (ex) girlfriend pooping last weekend... So I broke up with her. We were enjoying a nice night in when she said she had to pee. After 5 minutes I became suspicious and went to knock on the bathroom door to see if everything was alright. She said yes, she'd be out in a minute but I said baby I'm going to come in and check on you. And there she was, just sitting on the toilet. So I threw her off and just I expected there it is, a fuckin log floating in the toilet. She yelled at me like I was crazy but I said save it you poop monster, I'm breaking up with you. Left her on the floor red handed with the TP and everything. Couldn't have felt more betrayed... But now I'm off to find me a good girl who doesn't poop.
