Just a heads up random acts of violence happen everywhere so don't let that be an excuse for not getting outside of the wash U bubble. You should learn self-defense anyways.

Don't use the violent crime on the metro link as an excuse for not getting out of the bubble. You should take self-defense classes in any case!

Why won't you post this guy? What's your deal?

So you'll post about someone being afraid of protests but not about the fact that saint Louis isn't as dangerous as people make it out to be. That people should have self defense lessons no matter the city they live in and that they should still (safely) get out of the bubble? Wow you are so hypocritical guy. That's great you're operating to suppress voices just like the other systems who work on a similar agenda. You're only showing one side and my initial post wasn't even as controversial as the last one you just posted. What is your issue?
