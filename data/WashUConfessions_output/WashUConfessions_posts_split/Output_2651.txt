I confess that my life has been an excellent example of Heisenberg uncertainty.
When I try to have a good grade, my social life goes to trash.
When I try to have a good time with friends, my grade goes to trash.
Never gives good results for both. Only mediocre results at best.
But I also confess that my life has been a bad example of Heisenberg uncertainty when it comes to this:
When I try to ask out a girl, she always gets a boyfriend the next day.
Certainly gives good results for both of them!
So, if you want a girlfriend, just ask me to love someone. You can be the next winner! Don't worry about further decomposing my atom-size heart pieces because they don't go nuclear-fission that easily anymore.
