Second half of my senior year of high school I went to anger management that was mandated by an attorney in exchange for his services - this was three years ago and I was such a different person, I can't look back now. Anyway, the classes worked wonders, but recently I have noticed an ugly trend which is me getting mad to the point where I am dizzy and start to black out. My father had severe anger issues (probably where I get it from) and still does, he just has mellowed out in his older years. I'm terrified of the impact on my mental and physical health that this resurgence of anger is having as well as how it's affecting those I care about. Today I screamed so loudly that talking at work hurt. I'm embarrassed at how I handled myself, I thought I was beyond this. I'm terrified and don't want to take a step backward.
