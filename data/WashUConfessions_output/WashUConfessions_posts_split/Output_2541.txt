I can't do this anymore. I have no intention of killing myself but something has got to change. You'd think after four semesters I would understand how this whole "college" thing works-- when to kick back, when to crack down, but here I am, flubbing exams that I really should be doing better on. Combine that with the prospect of having to enter the real world and the very real threat of not having a job and I'm a bona fide train wreck.
It comes down to anxiety and depression. I don't use it as a a crutch to say that is the actual reason behind me not performing as well as I'd like, but it definitely contributes in the form of nerves over prioritization, lack of motivation, whatever. Until recently, I prided myself on being super out there, friendly, and extroverted, and only about six or seven of my best friends knew that I suffered from two debilitating mental health conditions and cried myself to sleep multiple times a week. My sleep schedule is horrifying, I don't have class until late morning or noon but lack the motivation to get out of bed. This is getting difficult to hide, and I find myself going to the restroom or taking breaks in classes to go compose myself or skipping out on commitments just so that I don't start crying in the middle of shit. This is followed by me trekking back to my apartment, crying, falling asleep, waking up, and frantically half-assing whatever it is I have to do.
I was really looking forward to college, and I don't know whether it's because of my mental condition, or because I'm not good at making my own decisions, but I just feel done with this whole thing and want it to be over, to the point where right now, I'd really like to graduate a semester early. This is fun, the people are great, but I don't know if this is for me anymore and I really want out. What's more, I want someone to tell me they're having the same thing going on. People can say it's going to be okay, and that everything passes eventually, but what if it doesn't? I'm so scared of that, it's paralyzing.
