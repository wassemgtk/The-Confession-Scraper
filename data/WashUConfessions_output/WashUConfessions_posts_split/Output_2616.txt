I didn't get a return offer from my summer internship despite getting outstanding reviews and I've had more job interviews than I could've dreamed of but never got past first round. I've done everything right as any serious job seeker would do but nothing is working at all. Whatever skills I have, no one seems to desire. For a long time I thought employment wasn't right for me but I think living isn't right for me. Why should I keep living if all I'll do is contribute to overpopulation? I confess that I'm really at the end of the line here. Is it all because my GPA tanked after freshman year? I've switched majors and worked hard to get it back up to over 3.5 but just barely, so has the damage become irreversible?

And to my parents: I'm sorry I had to choose to come to a self-proclaimed prestigious school and I'm sorry that all I've done so far is being a financial burden. But I cannot live with the idea of already spending so much money for education all for nothing. I've set myself a deadline. If I have no full time job lined up by the end of Nov., I'll end all this futile effort once and for all. I wanted to come to this school to have a better future opportunity to support you both in the future, and I'm so disappointed that will likely not come true. At the very least, I can make it so you don't have the burden of supporting a child anymore. I love you, mom and dad.
