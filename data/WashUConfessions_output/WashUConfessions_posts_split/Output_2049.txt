I confess that last year I was raped and couldn't bring myself to call it that until right now. I was blackout drunk when a boy took me back to his apartment and when I came to we were hooking up and I was mortified. I didn't know this boy at all and definitely did not consent to what we were doing. I immediately left only to find out I had no idea where I was and had to have someone come find me. I know everyone on this campus jokes about consent but it's not funny. You may not realize that someone is blackout but you can definitely tell when someone is too drunk. We all need to take responsibility to make sure no one guy or girl has to go through this.
