I got my LSAT score back today. With next to no preparations (finished 2 previous tests, that's it) I've got a 96th percentile. I don't really know what I should feel because I'm pre-grad and I'm only taking the LSAT for some weird, personal reasons and I have no intention to apply to law schools whatsoever. However now I have a score way better than that of my GRE (which I did spend time to prep for). I'm a senior so there's nothing I can do at this moment really but I just want a place to share my super ambivalent feelings about this and not sound like bragging...can't talk about this to my friends because they just assume I'm bragging and I know some of them to whom LSAT really matters spent a lot of time prepping and got a much lower score on the same test. I don't think I'm talented in what being a good lawyer requires (I'm extremely aversive to any sort of conflicts to the extent that I'd make concessions I shouldn't make just to avoid conflict). I guess I'll just say why don't grad schools accept LSAT.
