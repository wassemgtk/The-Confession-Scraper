I wish people understood SHS's capabilities before they complain. SHS isn't set up in way that allows for continual therapy for severe mental health issues. They can provide a few sessions to help someone get back on their feet, and can provide emergency services, but in cases where a student may have mental health issues that are more long-term and severe, SHS is not in a place to be able to provide those services. If students with long-term mental health issues are over-utilizing SHS, then they are minimizing supply of therapists who can help students who might need only a handful of sessions.
