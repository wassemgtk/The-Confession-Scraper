statistically speaking, I'm sure that quite a few of the people I am close to have been raped or sexually assaulted.  yet nobody i know has told me that they have experienced that.  of course I'm not saying I "deserve" to know just because I'm a friend of theirs.  nobody who has been raped owes that to anyone else, and they should only talk when they feel safe to do so.  but it hurts me to think that maybe people i care about haven't told anyone at all, and they're suffering in silence.  i just hope they've been able to talk to someone they trust.
