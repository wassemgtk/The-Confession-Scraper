FREAKING NEW YEAR! I hope everyone's been enjoying some time off from work and school. I wanted to take some time to thank everyone for the support I've been getting since I took over early last year. 

Sometimes I recognize people on campus from the Confessions community and I REALLY want to say hi and thank them for being so awesome - but I can't do that, so I'd like to at least say here that the support that people have given me has truly meant a lot. I hope you feel that we've added a new dimension to the community that otherwise would not exist. 

For the sake of looking back at 2014... Facebook won't provide the full Insights data for the past year, but the most popular posts in the last quarter of 2014 (roughly how long I've been running the page) in terms of People/News Feeds reached are:

1 - https://www.facebook.com/WashUConfessions/posts/1001767829850032

2 - https://www.facebook.com/WashUConfessions/posts/989504784409670

If anyone cares, I think the post that has influenced me the most the past year (both as a student and as the admin) was one submitted by an anonymous professor:

Either way, I want to give a heartfelt THANK YOU to those who have been supporting this page. It's truly been an honor and privilege serving as the administrator the past few months, and I'm looking forward to what 2015 will bring!
