As an upperclassman who's never really been in a relationship and doesn't find anything beneficial about random hookups, I end up flirting with and asking out many girls. It's not because I'm some sort of man whore, but it's because I want nothing more than to have a genuine relationship. Not just hookups or booty calls, but someone that I can talk to and laugh with and go out on real dates with. But I have a reputation now as that person who asks every girl he meets on a date, and I don't know what to do about my problem...
