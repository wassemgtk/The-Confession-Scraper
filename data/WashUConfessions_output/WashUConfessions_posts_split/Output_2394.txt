When I was applying to schools, my parents never expressed any concern about how much WashU cost. Now that I'm a senior applying to grad school, I feel like they're holding it over my head in the sense that they're constantly talking about how "I really can't apply to X school because they spent *so* much money on my education already." I've loved my time at WashU and I can't imagine having gone anywhere else, but if I had known it would've been such a problem, I might've chosen differently.
