I confess that before I came to this school, I believed that the world was 6,000 years old. I was raised in a conservative muslim family, and I was told that if I "strayed from the path" that I could not be saved. I have always been fearful of retribution in the afterlife, even after I secretly became an atheist, because I have been brainwashed my whole life that apostates deserve damnation. I just want to thank the school for enlightening me and making one less ignorant person in this world. Many things I have learned would be considered obvious by most people, but for me were huge leaps. I am a new person now, and I have this school and my new friends to thank for that.
