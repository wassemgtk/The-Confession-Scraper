I used to identify as only straight, however after getting really involved with the LGBT community as an ally, I've slowly been growing curious about experimenting with women. I remember being 8 years old and being curious about women but being petrified about being a lesbian (my family is old school traditional and believed that anyone who wasn't straight was wrong) so I wouldn't let myself indulge in those thoughts and made an exaggerated effort to think only about boys so for years I haven't had those thoughts. When I'm drinking I have way more of an urge to make out with girls than I do with guys (and NO it's not to turn guys on -_- ) but I don't know what this means. 

Today I met this girl and the way she smiled..I've only ever felt those butterflies from my ex-boyfriend. I wouldn't say I'm bi and still identify as straight but I don't know what this means. I'm scared to talk to my LGBTQ friends because I don't know if they'll take me seriously. Everyone I know says that they've known they were lgbtq since they were little but it's only been in the past couple of years that I've been questioning and curious so I don't know what to do with that. I feel like they'll think I'm just a silly straight girl playing around with girls before going back to my privileged space. I don't know, I'm just confused and a little (a lot) scared...
