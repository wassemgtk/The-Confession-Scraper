So I fell asleep on the 2nd floor of the library yesterday while studying orgo, then I recall being in some kind of an aircraft which I was sure was a dream at the time, because there was a girl next to me who was really attractive and was talking to me which rarely happens, and then I just woke up in my apartment in Cali. I have absolutely no idea what happened, but I do know 24 hours has passed, I am wearing different clothes, but oddly the same underwear, and the contents of my backpack are slightly different, including a Chicago Cubs cap, which I do not recognize. Everything else is the same. I am hungrier than I've ever been in my life, I am currently waiting for a pizza delivery and I am typing this in an attempt to distract my brain from the fact that I am starving and panicking. Thank god my wallet is intact, and so is my computer, but my phone's unlock pattern doesn't work. I don't see any evidence of a plane ticket or a confirmation email of any sort. I really would like to call American Express to see what's been charged on my card, but I can't unlock my phone and so far nothing is showing up online. I really don't want to spend money on a return ticket, especially if it turns out I already had one. I need to start studying for my Orgo final ASAP, but I don't have my notes with me. I messaged several of my friends here and back at WashU and none of them have seen me yesterday. My suite mates said my room is in the exact same condition I left it. What's really strange is I don't have any sort of a hangover or headache or pain, except for the hunger I feel great. For now I'll just focus on calming down and eating my horrible Papa John's pizza, which certainly wasn't my first choice, but they are the only chain I could think of that offered online ordering. Okay, typing all this out really helped.
