I just got caught shoplifting. And I'm weirdly okay with that. I'm not sure what to make of this. I think I actually felt relief when I was caught - it might have turned into a really bad habit. I know this might affect my job prospects but I'm glad that I got caught in the beginning. Somehow I feel like I don't have to pretend to be perfect anymore. It's official that I have this dark side. My main source of panic is my parents finding out. It might be a one time thing, but I've managed to build up this model child image of myself and they are going to be so disappointed. But I'm hoping to resolve this at my end - as an adult - because this might just be the push I needed to see myself as one and begin to actually take into account the consequences of my actions.
