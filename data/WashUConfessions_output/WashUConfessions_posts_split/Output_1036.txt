After a few difficult semesters, I have a good shot at finally making the Dean's List. I've worked hard and I just want to make my parents and myself proud but I'm terrified that one class will somehow screw me over and I won't make it--again. It seems like everyone around me has made the Dean's List at some point and I still have yet to make it which stresses me out.
