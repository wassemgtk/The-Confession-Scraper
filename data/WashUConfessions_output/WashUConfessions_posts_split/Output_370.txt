To those present at the Arts and Sciences scholarship dinner on Thursday night: I cannot believe how rude the majority of the people present were when the choir performed.  You could not shut your mouths for fifteen minutes to listen to the pieces we have been working on since August?  Seriously?  I have never been so offended as a performer.  It's really your loss though, since you all missed out on the most spectacular rendition of "Leonardo Dreams of His Flying Machine" that we have ever done.

To those who did listen: thank you.  It was a pleasure to perform for you.
