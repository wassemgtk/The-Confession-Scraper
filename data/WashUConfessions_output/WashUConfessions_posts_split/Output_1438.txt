I just listened to a podcast that I think is really relevant to a lot of discussions happening on campus: "Are liberals stifling intellectual diversity on campus?" (from the Intelligence Squared U.S. podcast).  I know that a lot of people in this community think that discussion should always be civil and not inconvenience others, but I strongly disagree. It scares me to see someone say on yik yak that they support protestors who are polite, regardless of their positions. Sometimes, change comes with offensive or inconvenient protest and debate.  We NEED to be having these discussions on a college campus.  I encourage everybody to listen to the podcast (it's a debate, it shows both sides).  Let's have this conversation.  Let's have more conversations, even if it's uncomfortable!
