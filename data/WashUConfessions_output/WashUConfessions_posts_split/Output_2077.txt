I confess that i find smart guys incredibly sexy, those i can share my exciting thoughts and crazy philosophical ideas with. A guy who cooks is also super sexy, especially a guy in nothing but an apron while i can hug him from behind and play with his weiner. A nice guy is also a must, one who cries watching Frozen and lending me his jacket. Though i admit that could never admit to another person that such is my type of men.
