There was a recent buzzfeed about things Indians are tired of answering (http://www.buzzfeed.com/regajha/questions-people-from-india-are-sick-of-answering), and it was funny and all, and pretty true. Then I realized how sad it was that a lot of these were true. We don't have "monkey gods" and pray to cows. We don't eat with our hands because we're heathens. Bollywood is crazy and over the top, but its not an accurate description of India at all (neither is National Geographic for the matter). We don't really eat chicken tikka masala and naan every day (even though the station at BD seems to think so). We're not all smart pre-meds that only care about school. We also don't all party hard. Some of us don't like to hang out with each other because we like to have different perspectives around us, while some of us only want to hang out with each other because we can all relate to ABCD struggles. We also don't always date other Indians. Not all of us are Hindu, and not all of us who you think are Indian are actually Indian (South Asians come from Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Nepal too!). And what is that accent everyone uses around me? I don't know anyone that actually sounds like that. PSA: Every time the word "India" is mentioned in class, I'd appreciate it if my classmates didn't turn around to look at me, because I'm honestly just as American as the next person. It is my opinion that with the Diwali show here and other common mainstream misconceptions, India and South Asians are rather comically viewed as a foil and I wish there was some event that celebrated the rich variety of our culture (not just "Diwali" and "Holi").
