The other night I was sick, so I took a few Benadryl and passed out. I woke up after a few hours to a whirring sound. Then, as I came to, I realized it was a girl having an orgasm. I looked around and realized that I was not having sex, and it definitely wasn't porn. I opened my door and saw my suitemate and some random girl going after it. I passed out again and when I woke up I was too embarrassed to ask if it was true, or just a pill-induced dream....
