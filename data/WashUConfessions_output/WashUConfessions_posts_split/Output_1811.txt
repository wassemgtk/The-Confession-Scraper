I know i'll probably get flak for this in the comment section but as a junior I hate the fraternity system at Wash U.   I have a couple of amazing friends in fraternities and I think their awesome but every one of them tells me that the rush process is basically just a facade.

 They tell me that nearly 90% of the rush class is basically already decided before rush starts and their is lots of dirty rushing where certain of the 90% are invited to the house outside of normal rush events to get to know brothers (and have basically an auto leg up when decisions are made). They tell me that to be part of that 90% you have to had already known a couple brothers very well and already become friends with them (at open frat parties which are apparently part of the rush process) so they will vet for you.

Even then, I've also heard reports of the shallowness of especially some of the frats.  "He doesn't LOOK like someone who'd be in our frat" as in someone who is excessively handsome and will pull women.  like i thought you're supposed to be a fraternity of brothers? brothers aren't supposed to be superficial, their supposed to love you for who you are inside.

The fact that I knew none of this before really irks me because it all seems blatantly unfair.  I am not super handsome but I tend to think i am a pretty friendly and genuine guy.  I also had always been under the impression that everyone at rush was on an equal footing when the official process starts.  The fact that it isn't and this is hidden from people makes me want go to the houses and burn them all down because its utter bullshit and really hurts a lot of kids self esteem (speaking from experience) and seems to be a terrible system.
