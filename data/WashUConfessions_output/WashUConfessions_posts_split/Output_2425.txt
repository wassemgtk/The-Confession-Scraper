Years ago I became a human. My vital form, previously stored in the blood of an ancient winged unicorn, was transferred to this planet and I was granted a task to take over our world prior to my final reverse transformation. My Dread Lord has commanded me to imbue upon this world a sense of chaotic antimatter to cause energetic pyrochromancy, and I am close to task completion. March 14 2015 1:59:26.5 AM shall be portal opening, during which I shall ascend into my original magical form. I bid this university Godspeed with all of its endeavors, and may we someday meet again.
