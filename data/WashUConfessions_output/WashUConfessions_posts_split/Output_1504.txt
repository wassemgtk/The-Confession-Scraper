I talked to the school today, that without some financial assistance, I will have to drop off after freshman year. I showed them what I have achieved so far and what I have done to make Wash U a better place. But their response was simply “It’s just financials. It’s objective.”

I told them that I don't feel like I am viewed as a full person.

Wash U prepares students to become leaders who can make an impact on our communities and the world. Yet when they are making decisions they don’t seem to care about the person that I am, the influence I am making, and the impact I will make on people’s lives.
