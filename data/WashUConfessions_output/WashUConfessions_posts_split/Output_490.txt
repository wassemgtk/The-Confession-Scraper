I'm really struggling with deciding whether I believe in God or not. I've been raised a Christian my entire life, but now that I'm in college and am not being forced to go through the motions, I've been trying to figure out what I personally believe and it's really scaring me because I'm afraid of choosing wrong. I don't know who to talk to because everyone I know seems to be firm in their beliefs.
