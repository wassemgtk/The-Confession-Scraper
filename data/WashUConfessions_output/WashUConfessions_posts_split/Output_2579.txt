I once had to call EST for a friend who drank too much and felt like she was dying. Two EST members came, and only one of them was friendly and helpful (for whom I am grateful) - the other was hostile and rude. The two very loud, very rude, and VERY judgmental WUPD officers - who did absolutely nothing but stand outside and chat between themselves - did not contribute productively to the situation, either. I've always been told to call "the fistful of fives" if I need help, but honestly after that experience I can't say that they have my vote of trust.
