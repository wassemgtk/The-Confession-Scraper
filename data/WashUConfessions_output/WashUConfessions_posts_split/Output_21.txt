I feel like there need to be more/better spaces for people who don't go to WILD. Whether it's due to social anxiety, problems with alcoholism, claustrophobia, etc., WILD is definitely not the event for everyone. There need to be alternative opportunities on campus, safe spaces, where we can get away from the drama and the parties. This whole campus shuts down on the day of WILD, and there's nothing else to do and nowhere else to go. Staying in one's room isn't enough and can still pose problems.
