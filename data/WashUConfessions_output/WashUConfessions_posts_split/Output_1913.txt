I'm a junior with LD/ADHD and I've been trying my damned hardest to change myself so that I can be good at school. I don't need to figure out how to be smarter, because I'm already smart. I already know what I like and what I want to do with my life. Here's what I've learned so far during my time at WashU, shout out to the other learning disabled kids here.

You can succeed as a student here without learning a goddam thing. Whether or not you like it, it's true, and by the time you're an upperclassman, you'll know a good number of people who will be terrible in their fields but have insanely good GPAs. If you can learn and still suck at school, you can be great at school and not learn anything.

The best bathrooms are in Cupples II and Knight Hall. Next time you leave class because it feels like your brain is melting out of your ears, go pretend to take a shit while playing video games at one of these luxurious spots. Excellent WiFi as well if you have a nintendo ds or playstation vita for online gaming.

Don't bother studying with the kids in your classes unless they sit at the front of the lecture hall. You'll likely see them at Cornerstone when you take your exams, and these are the kids you'll make friends with. They are cool people and the only people you'll actually get to collaboratively work with without feeling like the slow kid in the group.

Stop thinking of yourself as "disabled" or "retarded". Keep in mind that the education system WashU upholds is fucking boring and probably worse than high school. The way these professors have to teach is annoying to them too, and they know it's not really effective. Most of them are pretty chill, but yea they look annoyed during class because they feel like they're wasting both their time and our time.

Don't listen to the haters. You know the types of kids I'm talking about. They don't know how much they make themselves look like total clowns.

Also remember that you're probably someone with lots of cool experiences that you got the chance to experience while you were sucking at school.

Chins up, you'll make it through school here even if it feels impossible at times. You'll have a fucking awesome life and you're gonna be a total baller. College is only four or five years long, and you've got a full lifetime of being awesome to do, so that really puts things in perspective.

Congrats to everyone on surviving yet another semester of boring school!
