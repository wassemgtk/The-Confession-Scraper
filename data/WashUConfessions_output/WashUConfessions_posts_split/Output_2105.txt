I hate that I have to feel ashamed to tell people that I am a conservative. I shouldn't have to feel ashamed to admit that I am a registered republican. But I do. People do not understand that equality is two way street. Yes, I believe that racial inequality is a major problem. Yes, I believe that social and economic inequality are problems.-- just because I am a republican does not mean I'm evil, racist, or privileged. But as people go on republican hating tangents in class, they do not realize that they are not treating me with equality.  I don't care if you don't agree with my political ideology-- the beauty of America is that you don't have to agree with me! But I do expect the same respect with which I treat people of different views. Today, I stop feeling ashamed. I'm a republican and proud of it.
