sion #1058

This is kinda related to #1054 I guess... Couple of years ago, I spontaneously walked up (on campus, daytime) to a girl whom I didn't know at all, saw around the campus a couple of times and found very attractive, and told her that she was charming. I'm an aromantic asexual (and kinda asocial) individual and I had absolutely no interest in getting to know her, starting a conversation or trying to hook up--I just found her attractive. I thought she looked a little depressed and a compliment would brighten her day up as well. I was relieved to let my feelings out at the moment. Looking back at it now, I find what I did extremely awkward and wrong, and I'm pretty sure I creeped her out. Now it's become by far my most embarrassing memory. Every time I recall it (which is like once or twice every day), I hate myself and feel terrible for making someone uncomfortable. I wish it never happened...
