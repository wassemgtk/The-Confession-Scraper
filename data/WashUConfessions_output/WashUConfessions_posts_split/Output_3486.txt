Hi, Wash U Confessions. This isn't a confession, but I wanted to tell you guys something. I've been seeing a lot of prospective students post on Wash U Confessions about the negative view of Wash U this page is giving them. A collection of anonymous posts is in no way an accurate collection of the student body's view of their university, and I feel like this site (while entertaining for those of us who go here already) could be giving outsiders the wrong idea and even causing them to change their future plans. I think it would be a lot better for everyone if this page could be made private to people who don't go to Wash U. Don't you think so?
