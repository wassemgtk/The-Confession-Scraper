It's been over 3 weeks and I feel like I haven't made any real friends here. I'm socially anxious and awkward, and all anyone does is exclude me. I just want to know and enjoy the people I go to school with. Is that too much to ask? You all seem like great people, but I'm scared and intimidated to talk to people. I feel secluded at the clubs I go to and no one ever shows genuine interest in me. Help.
