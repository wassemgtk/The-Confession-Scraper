I was going to spend Thanksgiving with my gf's family in FL, but we broke up two weeks ago... so I ended up staying in St. Louis. When I told my friends I was going to be alone all break, they were like, "Sorry man, that sucks". But you know what? I had an awesome break. 

Things I didn't do this break: see family, interact with people, eat turkey, watch/play football

Things I did: read, draw, listen to music, play guitar, order takeout, watch movies, play with my roommate's dog, shoot hoops, ride my bike around forest park 

So basically, I had a blast. 

Happy Thanksgiving y'all.
