I confess that I'm so tired of my roommates trying to derail me from being healthy. Last year I was going through some really bad depression and used food as a coping mechanism and gained lots of weight and felt horrible because of the horrible things I was putting in my body. Part of my recovery included eating healthy and working out regularly and it has changed my life completely and I don't know if I'd be where I am right now if it wasn't for that. My roommates are really unsupportive and keep pressuring me to eat unhealthy or skip workouts because it makes them feel bad for not working out or eating healthy, and I don't know how to tell them that it's one of the few things keeping me sane.
