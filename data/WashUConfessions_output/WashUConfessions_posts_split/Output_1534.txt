There's this girl that I really like, but I'm not sure that I'm ready to go a relationship... I'm not about the hook-up culture, so I actually want a girlfriend, but I still have some pretty hurtful emotional baggage from my last relationship (it was a while ago, too). I don't want to dump that on her, but I like this girl immensely, so much so that someone was able to tell just by seeing the way I look at her (meaning there's a decent chance she knows). I really want to make a move, but I don't want to put the weight of my past on her, and I feel like I'm about to pop trying to figure out how I should approach the situation.... halp?!?!
