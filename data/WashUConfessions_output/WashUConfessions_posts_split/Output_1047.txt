Why WashU is a really awesome school

Sure, people are really supportive and blah diddly blah. But do you all, all you students, all you prefrosh, all you randos following this page- do you realize what we have at this school?
On every campus tour I went on, all across the country, they always vaguely say they have lots of clubs, so many clubs they even have a juggling club. WashU not only has a juggling club, they have a juggling  club affiliated with some of the best youth jugglers in the country via City Museum's Circus Harmony! WashU doesn't stop there, we have clubs for butter churning, bee keeping, medieval combat, and  if thats not your thing there's always the mariachi band. Maybe we have less sports pride than state schools, but anyone interested can check out clubs for fencing or archery.

But maybe you need to leave the campus scene, what could you possibly do in the greater St. Louis area? With the free public transportation, bus and metro, you get for being a student, its pretty easy to get around. But if thats not enough, just rent a car from campus. Or you know, get a bike real cheap from other students selling in desperation on Free and For Sale. And with your vehicle of choice you can pop over to the Zoo, or the Science Center, because STL is one of the very few places in the world where those have free admission. Try the history museum and brush up on what the 1904 world's fair was all about, it comes up all the time anyways. If the gigantic St. Louis Art Museum is too overwhelming you can always visit the Pulitzer, or CAM. Not into museums? Try touring Schlafly or Anheuser Busch breweries. If you want the free alcohol goat petting combo, make the slightly longer trek out to Grant's Farm. And these are all just the free things!!! DO YOU SEE HOW MANY FREE THINGS THERE ARE??? Of course you can also go to the Botanical Gardens or City Museum which are well worth the price of admission. Or go see the STL Symphony in Powell hall with discounted student ticket prices.

You can do internships for class credit or money from the career center if its unpaid.

You can get involved in research with your dream professor with your raw enthusiasm.

You can make a difference in the community by volunteering your time and effort.

This school is a land of opportunity. There is plenty of room for criticism, but I think we're all aware of that. Just know there is great wonder in this land.
