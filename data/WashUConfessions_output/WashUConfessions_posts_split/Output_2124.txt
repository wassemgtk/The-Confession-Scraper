I confess that I no longer identify as Christian, and it has made all the difference. I was raised in a Christian community and I honestly had a pretty good time at church, but one thing never sat right with me. There was always an undercurrent of fear. We would dance and sing, but we were always warned that hell awaited us if we didn't do right. I still identified as Christian until my sophomore year of college all because I feared going to hell if I didn't. I don't fear hell anymore. Since renouncing Christianity, I am able to contextualize myself and the world around me in an open and free way. I'm not saying that irreligiousness is necessarily the best route for people as many religions do in fact do great things for people, but if you are only clinging to a religion due to ANY type of fear then you may be wasting your time.
