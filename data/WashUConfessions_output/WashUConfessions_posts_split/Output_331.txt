My suitemates throw a lot of parties using our common room without telling the rest of us beforehand, so I never realize I should study for midterms somewhere other than my room until it's too late. It's gotten to a point where I've mapped out an escape route involving climbing out my room's window. I haven't done it yet, nor do I hope I ever have to, but I'd be lying if I said I didn't want to.
