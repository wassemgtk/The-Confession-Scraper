These tuition hikes are ridiculous. To help pay for school, I work two part-time jobs and use various outside scholarships that only cover a fraction of the cost. While WashU does cover quite a bit of the tuition, there is still a significant portion that my family has to scrounge up. This past year, my father had expensive cancer treatments  (which were not covered by insurance, as his insurance provider dropped him), and even though WashU has expressed their deepest sympathies for what my family is going through, they haven't been able to do a thing about the now 27K I owe the school. I honestly don't know how I'm going to afford my senior year.
