I did LAUNCH a while ago. I think I lost the "Warm and Fuzzies" we did; the people in my group and I don't talk much now but I was going through a really rough time when I came here and what they wrote was really comforting, even if they did it just to have something to say. I can't find the thing I put them in, and I know I brought them back with me. I'm really scared because some of those messages helped me get through a tough period and I like those memories.
