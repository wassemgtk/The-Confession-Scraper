There's quite a bit that I'd like to say, but fortunately it all sort of revolves around the same point: community.

To be honest, when I first visited Wash U after getting accepted, I felt this rush of friendliness and welcomeness from everyone I came into contact with. This wasn't just limited to the OWL hosting me or their friends. No, I got this warm feeling from literally everyone: nerds, jocks, fraternity brothers, sorority sisters, acapella kids, etc. I felt blessed that I was going to be attending a place where, I thought, everyone was a part of this family - everyone just had their own little pods or groups that they were just a little closer with.

It was magical to be blunt with you all. It may seem romanticized, but I guarantee you all saw the same thing - this unconditional love between each and every person on this campus. I didn't see people hating on someone else for choosing to be in a fraternity. There weren't kids picking on others for studying on a weekend night. Nobody was backbiting about kids in their acapella cliques or their sorority squads. Again, I thought for sure there was this unconditional love among us all.

Freshman year came around, and I continued to see that. That's the beautiful thing about freshman year - we're all so innocent and pure that we only see the best in each other with no reservations about who we meet or become best friends with. Each interaction we made was precious to us, meant the world to us.

Yet suddenly we all join our respective groups: frats, sororities, acapella groups, sports clubs, business frats, etc., and just like that we've turned against one another. People who aren't in acapella group will look at them and be like "My god, they're so cliquey." Girls in one sorority will look down on those in another sorority. People who once shared shots and memories together now look at each other with disgust and it's repulsing.

And from then on the community is literally split down so many lines its like a jigsaw puzzle, but the pieces don't ever fit together perfectly. We end up not associating with each other because apparently our groups now have to identify us instead of the other way around. And as we get sucked into this mentality, we begin to think that everyone is in their own clique and the community continues to fragment.

That shouldn't be the case though. Why can't we recognize that our groups and organizations are just things that we chose to be a part of. Instead of identifying as part of this fraternity or this club or that group, why not identify as students of this University or members of the Wash U community. It may seem that everyone is cliquey or reserved or group-centric, but we just think this because we're much the same way. Break these clouds that we've put on our groups and organizations and let's build this community back. Let's build a community where a guy who isn't in an acapella group can be best friends and hang out with someone who is in one. Let's develop a place where kids don't feel like rushing or going through recruitment is a biased thing but is something where everyone is just looking for their best friends. Let's all try to make one big party where we come with no tags but merely interests.

This isn't just targeted to those who are in groups or organizations though. To those who feel like they're on the outside looking in, honestly I was like you once, but I chose to stop being so critical of everything and now I feel welcome. I'm very much like all of you still, but I don't feel so outside anymore. Honestly, strip all your notions of the people you think so harshly of and go get to know them. You'd be surprised at how willing they are to meet you too. I used to think that if I didn't make a good first impression that I could never talk to someone or be friends with them. I also thought that if I didn't have an in with someone that I wouldn't ever get close with them. As cliche as it may sound, I was wrong. I said hello to someone. Asked others if they wanted to grab a bite to eat. Shared my life stories with many. All of this with people who I thought I could never talk to, and now some of them are my best friends.

All I'm saying is, keep an open mind about everyone. Don't ever think negatively of someone. Be welcoming of everyone that you meet. That's what makes this university great. It's filled with people who love unconditionally and see only the best in each other. There's an atmosphere of compassion and understanding that sits in every booth in BD and every seat on Main Campus. And who knows, maybe there will actually be this big party one day.

I would post a TL;DR, but I think the effect comes from reading the whole rant.
