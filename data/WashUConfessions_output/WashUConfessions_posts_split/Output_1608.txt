As a white student who watched BA: The Six, I admit I felt very uncomfortable.  I felt almost as if it wasn't meant to educate on the issues but rather place blame for them.  I understand that this is a very big issue throughout the entire country, but I don't agree that it should be labeled by "White cops killing black kids."  In all honestly, is it any worse that white cops were involved as opposed to a non-white cop?  Think about it.  Is it really racial prejudice because the cops are white and the victims are black or is it simply because the victims are black?

I grew up near STL in a town literally 99% white.  All my life, even still from coworkers of all races, I am told of the dangers of STL, of downtown, and of North County in particular.  My entire life I have been warned never to even step foot in some of these areas because of the likelihood of becoming a victim of crime (STL is always ranked at the top of crime per capita studies). You might think that this mindset is stereotyping and unjust but in the past year alone, multiple people I've met through school and sports have been shot and killed by black kids. So I ask anyone to explain to me, when you grow up in a town where hundreds of thousands of people of all races agree that its best not to let your guard down in a place like Ferguson, that an ordinary police officer (of any race) wouldn't be overly cautious of someone who appears to be a potential danger to them?  It shouldn't matter if the cop was white or black, or if the victim was white or black, when you are in a notoriously dangerous area and you have to be authoritative over people who do not respect you, you need to be prepared for the worst and sometimes the worst case scenario becomes reality.

Also, when I heard the line "No child should have to grow up in fear of making it to adulthood" (or something along those lines), I felt that it was misguided.  I felt that they were expressing that only black children live in fear when in reality, everyone does and for different reasons.  I'm not saying its justified to for black children to get killed because white children get killed by them, I'm just trying to explain that this city has always been divided and that everyone in this city fears for their life.  We live in a violent world and there are violent people who will continue to kill and murder.  Trying to turn it into a race war isn't going to fix anything.  In fact, using race at all prevents unison.  How can we claim to all be equal and live in unison if we are always trying to group ourselves as white, black, Hispanic, etc.?  The real problem should be police oppression.  When you stand up and say "We as Americans have a problem with police oppression"  I'll stand up with you, but when you say "Us minorities have a problem with police oppression"  I don't feel like it involves me, nor like I'm welcomed to be a part of the cause.  And before anyone tries to claim that white people don't get discriminated upon by the police, try growing up in a town where there is no racial divide.  I grew up in a county where meth and heroin are used like candy.  The police will always find ways to discriminate, its like its their job, and I myself have been discriminated and oppressed by officers simply because of what I was wearing, who I was with, or what time of the night I was out at multiple times.
