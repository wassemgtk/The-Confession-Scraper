sh U! 

Wash U Confessions is back, with a new admin and an easier way to submit confessions. You can now submit your anonymous confessions at www.washuconfessions.com. 

We'll be trying to get confessions out as soon as possible after a submission is sent through. 

I'm looking forward to bringing back this confessions page and giving people a place to share their most honest thoughts. I don't believe in censoring honesty, but please refrain from putting names or other sensitive information in confessions.
