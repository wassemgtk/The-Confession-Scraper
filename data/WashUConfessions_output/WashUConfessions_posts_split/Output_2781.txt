As a recent WashU grad, I am no stranger to feeling depressed and stressed out about school, the future, relationships, etc., and I can't help but notice a lot of these types of confessions on this page. So, to anyone and everyone dealing with emotional issues: professional help can be very helpful and extremely beneficial. However, finding the right therapist is sort of like dating--you might have to go through a few before you find the right one for you. Don't feel discouraged or condemn the entire system if you don't feel a good vibe or don't click with one professional. Shop around a bit, figure out what you need from a therapist and above all, don't give up. The right one is out there, I promise.
