This is partially a confession and parially a plea for help. I missed the fall chem lab exam because I was horribly ill. Now I'm taking the exam over the summer, and just found out lecture videos won't be available. Is a chance anyone has the chem 151 lecture videos for fall 2014? Even if it's just one or two it'd be a tremendous help because I'm largely an auditory learner.

This is the person that sent the confession about missing the chem 151 exam. I just found out going through what I brough home that my notes etc from the course somehow ended up in one of the boxes to go in storage and is still in st louis! I'm really really desperate and now having the lecture videos would be even more helpful to successfully reviewing the material for the exam. If anyone can help me please comment!

Dude, please. This is the person who missed the chem 151 final because I was so sick. I need to do well on this exam. The fact that I have none of my materials and no lecture videos has made my anxiety unbearable. I know that it's not so much a confession, but I don't even know where to start studying without anything to go from.
