I've been in a D/S relationship for over a year now and have attempted to break up with my dom 3 times. I can rationalize that he and I aren't a good fit for each other (we just aren't a great match personality wise) but every time I get around him, all the work he's put in to get me to respond to him works against me and I can't leave him. Even though I know we shouldn't be together, as a sub it's nearly impossible to find the courage to tell him that. I'm nervous that I'll never be able to leave him and I'll be stuck in a relationship that, although sexually satisfying, won't make me happy.
