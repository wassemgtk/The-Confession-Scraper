After the events of today, culminating with Wrighton's email, I have never been so ashamed to attend this university. If you honestly believe that someone who is obviously dressed up as Osama Bin Laden is representative of all Muslims, then you have way more problems than can be addressed in any forum at this school. The only thing that this picture is representative of is one of the most evil men to walk the face of the earth, and the celebrations that occurred across the country when he was killed. Anyone who hasn't been living under a rock for the past two and a half years can clearly see that. I'm not denying that the student in question faced any anti-Muslim sentiment, and that fact that she may have is unfortunate, but to irrationally imply that this picture is an example of that anti-Muslim sentiment is ridiculous. To blur the line between anti-Muslim (which most - unfortunately, I cant say all - of this school is not) and anti-terrorist/ism (which I'd assume most, and hopefully all of this school is) is unacceptable, and to in turn create an uproar trying to substantiate claim as foolish as "the students who posed for that picture are racist" literally sickens me. This is a new low for this school, and the students who honestly believe that there was anything anti-Muslim about that photo. As far as the girl being "scared" by that photo, I can only say this: You go to one of the cushiest, isolated-in-a-bubble-universities in the country and you're "scared?" Try going to live in a rough neighborhood in East St. Louis for a day and then lets talk about being scared.
