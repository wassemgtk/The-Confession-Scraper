I am really curious about the 50 Shades of Grey movie because I wanna see how they even tried to make it work given how poorly constructed the book is, and I'm someone who loves to watch terrible things and laugh. But all of my friends are either boycotting it because of the abusive relationship, or are generally too uncomfortable with the subject material. Which I completely understand, and respect.  I just don't want to go alone.

Yo ho, yo ho, a pirate's life for me...
