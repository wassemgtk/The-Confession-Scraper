The whole idea of it being okay to call someone "privileged" makes me mad, and mind you I'm a minority saying this. The fact is you haven't got a clue about the personal struggles and battles every individual has had to go through in their life whether they be white, black, poor, rich, straight, gay, male, female, etc. You really have no idea about the burdens that they have had to carry and there could be so many: dealing with disabilities, illness, family members with disabilities and illness, relationship problems, etc. And you honestly can't say that someone has gone through more "hard times" than another person based on their socio-economic status, gender or race. That's not being fair because again, A) You will never know everyone's entire story and B) how do you get away with calling a rich person "privileged" in comparison to a poor person who grew up in the getto? What if that wealthy person had to watch their loved one deteriorate from Parkinson's or something? I don't see how you can compare extremely painful hardships of two people, much less hardships you're ignorant about, and veto one as "privileged". How can you sleep with yourself at night?
