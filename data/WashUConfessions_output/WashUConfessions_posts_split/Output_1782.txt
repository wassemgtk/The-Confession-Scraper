This is gonna be a bit long, but there’s a gem at the end.

I confess that I’ve spent too many a Friday night like poster #2028 sitting in my room because I had no one to socialize with. I confess that, like so many of you, I came to WashU hoping I’d quickly find my network of close friends, that I’d bond perfectly with my floor, that all my Friday nights would be spent having fun with the people around me. It was a short-lived dream.

(While my life is by far not bad at all,) I confess that there have been some times last semester where I could’ve posted a confession to that effect had I wanted to, but didn’t because like 3 people already did that day and it would be redundant.

There are so, so many of us here who feel this way. Who feel scared of being alone. “And the funny thing is,” poster #2028 says, “so many people feel this way at WashU.. yet how come we can’t find each other?”

Well, I want to change this. I’ve been inspired by the fact that, below every confession about fear of isolation there’s a comment suggesting “message me” or “let’s hang out sometime”. I’m inspired by poster #2021 who reminded me that our community is why I fell in love with this school. I’m privileged to be involved in extracurriculars that have shown me how valuable it is to have a group of people you can always go to on campus, and I want to create this kind of community for everyone here at WashU.

So, here goes. Finally putting down this idea of mine on paper…

I want to create an unofficial no-commitment “group” called Hangout Fridays. It’ll be a place where people can go to hang out and meet new people on Friday nights. I envision that, maybe, you’ll be able to make new friends around the Cards Against Humanity table, or perhaps if you bond better over video games, you can head to the WiiU for a round of Smash Bros with like minded individuals. If you’re like me, an introvert thirsting for some real, serious conversation, maybe head to the philosophy or politics circle and engage in mind-expanding debate with your peers. Maybe you’re like “I don’t need none of this, I just wanna play a freaking board game with ppl” Then you can play a board game.

The idea is that it’ll be a place for all of us who have ever spent a Friday night alone in our dorm rooms. It’s for those of us whose amazing Facebook statuses mask our inner emptiness. It’s for those who feel utterly alone, but also for anyone who… well, has ever felt alone at one point and/or has wanted to play a freaking board game.

Can we get together as a community and stop being isolated voices crying out in the darkness? Can we create a safe place for people to go just have fun, branch out and make friends without the fear of social stigma? As Poster #2021 asked us, “Let’s all try to make one big party where we come with no tags but merely interests.”

This isn’t the Social Attitudes Club. If you want social advice to fix a deep-seated social problem, go there. I went once, and although it’s great, I found that for me, and probably the hundreds of others like me, that’s not what I need.

Please note that this is so, so not set in stone. The group will grow organically and will always be super open to suggestions. I just want to stop this enervating milieu of alienation and channel our community to do something good.

I know I would love to have something like this in place at our school, but now I need to know if Wash U feels the same, and for that I’m going to need support. Sorry for the blatant like-whoring but if you want to see this happen or be a part of it, like this post + tell your friends. (Suggestions? Please comment!)

Let’s stop dreading Friday nights and start saying TGIF instead.

TL;DR: Because I haven’t taken Writing 1, idk how to write a summary. So guess you’ll have to read the whole thing :P
