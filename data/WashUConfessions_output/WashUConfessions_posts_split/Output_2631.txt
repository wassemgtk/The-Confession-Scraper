I failed an exam because of mental illness, and I'm missing another because of it too. I'm getting help, but none of my professors know about it, and quite frankly, with such large classes, I don't think they would understand. They say "no exceptions" in the course syllabus to the drop one exam out of 3/4/5 exams rule. So I guess crying uncontrollably and being totally unprepared because of depression isn't an exception?
