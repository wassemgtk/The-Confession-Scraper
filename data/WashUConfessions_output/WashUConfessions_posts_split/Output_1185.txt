As a sophomore heading into these next two years, my biggest fear is that I will regret coming to WashU. I love the community here, the classes, and the culture. I've been fulfilled academically with a good GPA, extracurricularly with awesome clubs and activities, and socially with fantastic friends. These are definitely things I'm thankful for. But my parents are helping me pay for a very, very expensive education and I feel the constant pressure to be exemplary. I'm never good enough for myself because I feel like I have to achieve something that i wouldn't have been able to achieve going to my in-state school. When I was younger, I used to tell my parents I'd help pay for my little sister's college because by then I'd have graduated college and hopefully have a paying job. But now I'm looking at getting higher forms of education ( med school) which was never part of my plan before. Now I feel  greedy and I wish I went to a state-school to save my parent's money. Yes-- my family is well off enough that I didn't get substantial aid, but it doesn't mean I don't feel guilt when I see my parents worrying about retirement. I just hope that sometime in the future I can be successful enough and pay them back for their sacrifices.
