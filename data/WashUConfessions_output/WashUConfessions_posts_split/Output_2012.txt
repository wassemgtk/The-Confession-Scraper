Maybe I'm just saying this because I feel jealous, but I wish people from wealthy backgrounds could acknowledge poverty is one of the most difficult things to deal with. I'm not saying people with wealthy parents have easy or easier lives necessarily. But not needing to worry about money makes life much less difficult. I can say this with certain degree of objectivity as my father used to make A LOT of money. But six years ago, his partner screwed him over, thrusting my family from upper class to below average. I wouldn't dare say my family is poor, knowing how many people there are in this country who are much poorer. But I'm under constant stress from financial issues. My mom had to sell her car last summer. My dad's credit rating has plummeted.
