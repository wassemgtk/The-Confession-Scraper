2 of my friends have committed suicide in the past 2 months. The more I think on it, the more uncomfortable I get with the guy who was hunger striking to the point of death at Mizzou. I get that he probably assumed the university would something before it got to that point, and I get that the problems he was protesting are huge and the results of systemic issues that have unfortunately led to deaths themselves, but I can't help but be pained by the thought of using something so grave as leverage. Maybe I'm just taking it too seriously, I dunno. But suicide is heavy, man.
