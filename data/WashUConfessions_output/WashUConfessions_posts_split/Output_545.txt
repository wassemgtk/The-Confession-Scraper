I have a question.  Does anyone feel like they were happier in high school than here in WUSTL?  Don't get me wrong, I do like Wash U, I just felt like socially in high school it was much easier to form lasting bonds.  I just wanted to see if anyone else does/has felt that way; and what you did to fix it.  Thanks!
