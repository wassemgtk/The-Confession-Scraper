I've been paranoid about my gf cheating on me over break. She's great, and I have no justifiable reason to think she would, but I can't shake this nagging feeling that her one of her friends in particular is more than just friends. I know it's probably just me, but I just wish she wouldn't be as distant over break, and I'd like some reassurance from her.

I doubt I'm alone in this, so to all you boys and girls in relationships, if you haven't been in touch often over break, get in touch more this last week. Let them know they matter.
