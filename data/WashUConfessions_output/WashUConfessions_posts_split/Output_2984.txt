This afternoon, I went to the bathroom in Brown Hall. I took a giant shit and when I flushed the toilet, water came pouring out for about 10 seconds. I was scared that my poop would clog the toilet because the toilet's hole was abnormally small. But it eventually went down and I was really relieved.
