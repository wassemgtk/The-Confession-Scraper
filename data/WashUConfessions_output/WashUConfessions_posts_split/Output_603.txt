If you spill water on your computer or phone or any other electronic device, for the love of all that is sacred to you, like your hundred page thesis that you've been working on for the last month, the last photos of your dead grandma, or your giant collection of disco music (I won't judge), DO NOT TURN YOUR COMPUTER ON!!! If it's already on, TURN IT OFF!!! If it's off, as said above, DO NOT TRY TO TURN IT ON!!!

I work at STS and have had way too many people come in that have tried to turn their computer on after spilling water on it, and sadly, most of the time there's nothing that can be done but mourn for their fallen companion, and I'll tell you why. By itself, when the device is off, water won't do anything to your electronics. If you dry it out completely and remove all of the water, in theory nothing will have happened. When it gets bad is when there's water still  in the device and you try to run a current through it (turn it on), it can create circuits between places where there shouldn't be and it can short out your device and then you're screwed.

Long story short, if you spill water on your computer or any other electronic device, the best thing to do is leave it powered off, and if it's not already, do that immediately and dry it out. If you don't know how to take your computer apart, or don't feel comfortable doing it yourself, just bring it over to us at STS as soon as possible and we can work from there. But if you try turning it on and things start going wrong, we'll still try our darndest, but there probably isn't a whole lot that can be done.

Anyways, sorry for the long post, but it's just a shame to see so many people have to buy new computers or lose their data when it could be prevented. As always, I hope we helped and have a great day.
