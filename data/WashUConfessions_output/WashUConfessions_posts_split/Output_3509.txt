I have never drank a sip of alcohol, never smoked anything (not even Hookah), never cussed, never skipped class, I'm only in my second relationship, I don't have a fake ID, I have never been to a real college party, and I have never done anything illegal. Yet, somehow, my hometown friends and I always have a blast, but I haven't found these friends in college yet. I just want some people that I can feel comfortable being my crazy, enthusiastic self with. Unfortunately, most of the time I just feel lonely and lame. Is there anyone else here that feels the same way?
