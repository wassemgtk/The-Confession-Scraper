One of my best friends from home might transfer to SLU and is so excited about the prospect of hanging out all the time. It'll be nice to see her more often, but I think if she lived locally it might ruin our friendship. I was the only one from my high school to come to WashU, and I'd rather keep my home friends at home and my school friends at school, and not mix the two.
