I feel like the fact I don't drink has negatively affected my love life. It seems like all the guys at WashU I've met think that if I'm not rallying right along with them, then I'm not worth their time. Guess what: I can still have a great time when I'm sober. I like to dance like nobody's watching. I like to laugh at all the funny things drunk kids do. I can be fun too. It's not awkward unless you make it awkward. I'll be the exact same fun, smart, beautiful girl tomorrow... isn't that enough? I wish there were someone out there who could respect that, because right now I just feel like an absolute reject.
