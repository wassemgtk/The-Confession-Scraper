I really just want a girl to go see a movie with me. Just once I want to go on a date with a Wash U girl, and I'm pretty much out of time. Friends tell me I'm attractive and funny, so my inability to get any girls to even talk to me is probably because I'm a failure as a human being. Can someone explain where I've gone so wrong?
