I've never been a very open person. I never thought that I needed to be. My parents and I had a very relaxed relationship, they know I don't like to blabber about my day and they don't try to connect with me. My friends always considered me as really grounded, the nice and innocent one who is there to listen to their problems and talk about their days. However, I'd always think that I have nothing interesting to talk about (partially because nothing too substantial occurs in my life). In the end, even though I have some friends, I don't really emotionally connect with them like how I think friendships usually work. I don't usually initiate texts, and I'm really lousy about keeping a conversation interesting through texting back. As a senior, I'm worried that once I do leave this campus, there will be very few connections worth keeping. Every friend I have will be stuck at the acquaintance phase and I'll pull a high school maneuver and talk to people every half a year, if that. I don't really know why I'm writing this, but I'm just curious if anyone else feels the same way.
