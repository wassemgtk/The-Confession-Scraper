I come from a dirt-poor family, although no one could tell if they saw me, so I have a pretty good grip on this whole socioeconomic inequality thing being here, where the median family income is 500 thousand dollars a year.
That said, I still don't believe the government should subsidize all private colleges (there's public schooling for that) beyond what they already do for grants, loans, etc.
If I didn't get aid here, I wouldn't whine and bitch about inequality and say the gov't should pay for me, I'd get a job and go to a community college, do well, and transfer to either a 4 year or trade school.
But wait, not everyone can work and go to school!
Bullshit, I work and I go to fucking WashU, with an infinitely worse workload than the CC I considered going to instead.

If you really have a problem with WashU tuition, go to Mizzou.
