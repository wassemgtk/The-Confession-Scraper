John works the brick fire oven station (over by the pizza) in bd. I chat with him every time I see him on shift there because he's friendly and somehow we just started talking last year. We inquire about how each other's day has been, he's told me about his kids and grandkids, I know he has adult-onset asthma that showed up in the past year and that he's quitting smoking to help ease that issue. I also know he had an asthma attack the other day and didn't have his inhaler, and when I saw him struggling through it to finish his shift at work, the concern I felt was real. The fear and not knowing how I could help when he assured me he'd be done in a few hours and would handle the asthma attack when he was home, that was all very genuine.

Maybe I'm greedy for seeking authentic, emotional connections with other people because they make me feel fulfilled, but I'm certainly not doing it to maintain some deceptive public appearance. (It's not like I'm running for president lol)
