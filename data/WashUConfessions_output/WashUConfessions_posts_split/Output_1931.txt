The tragic incident today at Columbia made me really upset. I feel like most of us here are stressed out during finals week, so much that we constantly play this game of who has more work and harder finals. And I confess that I have been one of those people too. It makes me wonder how many times, I, as well as others, actually cheer each other on and care for each other's well being, when we are so caught up in our own lives. If anything like this happens with a WashU student, I think I will end up convincing myself that it was the school's fault, or the parents who pressured the student, but not me. And that makes me really sad.
