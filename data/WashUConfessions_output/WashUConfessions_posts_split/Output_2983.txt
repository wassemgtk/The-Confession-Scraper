It seems like every guy I start to get to know expects sex after the first or second date. What ever happened to developing a relationship where we get to know each other before having sex? Obviously I'm partially at fault for putting out when I don't really want to, but I feel too much pressure, like I owe you something. I know I made the first move to get to know you, but that doesn't mean I'm still interested after getting to know you. Showing initial interest doesn't mean I want to go all the way with you. Disclaimer: this confession does not mean the sex was bad...
