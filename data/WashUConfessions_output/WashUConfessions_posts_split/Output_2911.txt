After an incredibly high number of rude encounters on this campus, I have come to realize that some students need a refresher course on manners. We will take baby steps on this, and start with the magic words, "thank you." For instance, if somebody holds the door open for you, say thank you. I cannot count the number of times I have taken a moment out of my day to hold the door for someone only to be flat out ignored. You are not the Queen of England, and, for the record, I'm pretty sure even she knows basic etiquette and would not consider herself above practicing it. Here's another typical situation you can study: if you ask someone for help in class, outside of class, whatever, say thank you. This may come as a shock, but nobody is ever actually obligated to do you anything for you. Finally, say thank you to the staff. They are humans, not robots, and you will not die if you thank the chefs in BD as they hand over your food. If you are still unsure about incorporating these two words into your vocabulary, I suggest you take a year off to revisit kindergarten, where you will study other advanced topics, like sharing. TL;DR holy shit, say thank you
