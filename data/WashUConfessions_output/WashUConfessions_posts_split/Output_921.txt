Yo, message to all students who just finished their freshman year: freshman year is generally the worst. If your first year sucked, don't stress too much. When you get back to campus in the fall, try branching out in terms of classes you take, clubs you join, places you hang out or what you do in your spare time. I think a lot of people find that they make stronger and lasting friendships their sophomore year, not freshman year. Remember that college is what you make of it, and if you're not happy now, there are a ton of different things you could try or do to find what makes you happy.
