I'm abroad right now and I'm honestly so depressed. I don't really jive that well with any of the members of my program and nobody ever asks me to do anything. I ask people what they are doing on weekends in order to put myself out there, but am never invited. While everyone else is pregaming right now, I just cried to myself in my host home. I'd rather be back at Wash U where people will answer text messages and actually act like they want to hang out with you.
