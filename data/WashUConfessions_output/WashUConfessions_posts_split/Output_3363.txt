i would really, really appreciate if you publish this. thanks. An open letter to CS40 To Whom It May Concern: I am very disappointed in your organization as a whole in the way that you handled the distribution of the Macklemore tickets for this Sunday. Let me begin by first saying that I have no issue with the fact that the concert had to be moved from the South 40 to the Pageant. There are few things in life that are totally out of our control, and weather is probably first and foremost on that list. In fact, I actually applaud your efforts on finding another reasonably large venue so close to campus on what must have been very short notice. Outside of that, however, the situation was handled very poorly, in my opinion. Like many (but apparently not all) students, I received an email at 2:41PM about the location change for Sunday and the 2,000-ticket limit that went along with it. I read the email thoroughly because I wanted to make sure I got a ticket as I have been looking forward to this event all year. One important line from the email was this: “Tickets will be available (first come first serve basis): WashU ID REQUIRED 1 ticket per person.” I interpreted this as follows: since some guest tickets had already been sold (I estimated maybe 400) and since some tickets were probably reserved for the people planning the event (generously, maybe 100), I thought that as long as I was one of the first 1,500 people in line I would have no problem getting a ticket, since there was a 1 TICKET PER PERSON LIMIT (as there should be). Still, I wanted to be sure. So I went to the Res. Life office at 4:30, a full hour in advance. I was a little concerned when my place in line was on the sidewalk between Liggett/Koening and SoFoHo, but even so, I knew there were not 1,500 people in front of me. At the very most, there were probably 700 people. While I stood there, I noticed some people cutting in line with their friends, but I tried to remain calm about it since I knew I would still get a ticket without an issue. As 4:30 turned into 5:00, I was told* (*shouted at) by a CS40 student representative to “sit down” in line, as this would prevent people from cutting in line, or at least make it more obvious that they were cutting. I convinced myself that this would actually prevent cutting in line and was not simply a CS40 representative on a power trip, so I sat down, like almost everyone around me. However, there were no CS40 representatives monitoring the queue where I was positioned (or anywhere, for that matter), so the cutting still happened. Believe it or not, sitting down did absolutely nothing. Shocking. People would just walk up to where their friends were sitting and—wait for it—sit down with them. What a concept. Even though I saw this happening with some regularity, I was not that concerned because I knew there still weren’t 1,500 hundred people in front of me. At 5:30, the line started moving, and I felt encouraged. Shortly after, however, I was given some absolutely outrageous news: each person in line could get up to 3 TICKETS, as long as they provided 3 student IDs. What? Was I possibly hearing that correctly? Let me get this straight: So the CS40 people had made a somewhat noble effort to prevent line-cutting—and to support the people who waited for over an hour—by telling them to sit down, yet they then institute a policy which LITERALLY LET EACH STUDENT HAVE 2 PEOPLE CUT THEM IN LINE. And the people who cut didn’t even have to wait there! That is INSANE! Later on, the 3-ticket policy was reduced to 2. To me, this was an admission by CS40 that the policy was totally wrong from the start. Why they didn’t just CHANGE IT BACK TO THE “1 TICKET PER PERSON” POLICY THAT WAS LAID OUT IN THE EMAIL is beyond my comprehension. At 6:15, I reached the Res. Life annex tunnel area. There were still at least 150 people in front of me when I heard the bad news: they were out of tickets. Disappointed, I went to speak to someone from Res. Life/CS40. All she said was to “check the WUStock facebook page,” and that they “did not anticipate” the level of interest. Her arrogance, along with the arrogance of the student representatives of CS40, was as enraging as the fact that I didn’t get a ticket. The poor planning and holier-than-thou attitude of CS40 and ResLife is an embarrassment to this university. And the fact that students were walking up to other students at the front of the line and paying them to take their ID and get them a ticket is not necessarily an indictment on them, but more on the event organizers for not realizing that as an inevitability. What’s more, people didn’t even get their names checked off any list and there were a lot of people who cut the line multiple times and got way more than 3 tickets. All in all, a terrible job by everyone involved. I pay to live in ResLife housing. WUStock is sponsored by CS40 and ResLife. I also pay the outrageous student activity fee of over $400 each year. There are students who live off campus who got tickets. They don’t pay for ResLife housing. There are also hundreds of non-Wash U students who will be in attendance as paid guests. They don’t pay for ResLife housing. They don’t pay the student activities fee. They don’t pay tuition. To quote a classic piece of American cinema, they “she doesn’t even go here.” In light of all of this, I will be looking to get some sort of refund from ResLife or this University, and I encourage everyone else who did not get a ticket to do the same. Hopefully, there will never be another total and complete fubar like this in the future, and hopefully the CS40/ResLife people will learn to get off of their collective high horse and try to actually do the right thing for the people in line who were just trying to do the right thing. For all those going to the concert, I genuinely hope you have a good time and hopefully some people can take and post video for those of us who won't be there.
