I'm an introvert but hide it really well and go to parties and enjoy myself with friends, but sometimes I just want to spend my Saturday nights working on some craft or photography project...alone!  Then my friends freak out and want to know where I am, and it's hard to justify my reasons for not wanting to join them.
