My amazing boyfriend just broke up with me tonight because we've both been depressed for the past few months. His plan of action is to withdraw from everyone and obsess over one hobby; thus, he barely has involved himself in our relationship. I know that we should break up, because he wants or needs to be alone and not worry about a girlfriend (especially a girl who is especially needy because of her depression), but it hurts so badly. He is the most beautiful human being I've ever met. Even while he's in so much pain, he has made me promise that if I want to, I'll call him when I'm having a panic attack. I hope tomorrow morning he'll call and finally tell me what he's going through, and how he really feels, as he has yet to. I think he's afraid of being vulnerable. But I would rather be with him even while he's half-assing it because he's struggling to take care of himself than with someone else gives it his or her all. No one compares to you and what you've done for me. I love you, dude.
