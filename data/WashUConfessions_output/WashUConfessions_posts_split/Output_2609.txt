I honestly just want my senior year to be over, ever since I've been back from abroad nothing is the same. I'm not with the person I was before, I am woefully underprepared for the jobs that I am considering now and I am actually failing a class for the first time. This combination is becoming unbearable and I really just want to get it over with. I am also starting to regret going abroad since even though it was a nice experience I am now behind with any plans I had for the future whether they'd be graduate school or employment. It also depresses me that I've been always looking forward to senior year and now I think it'll just be a bad memory for me.
