While watching the Return of the Jedi, I began to wonder why the Ewoks had amassed so many weapons, such as the catapults, when they didn't really appear to have any enemies against which to use them (Barring the Empire of course). Having observed this, I believe the Ewoks had come involved in a Military Industrial Complex! Poor fuzzy guys, spending their currency on useless weapons that they really wouldn't need (those catapults were really effective in the battle of endor)
