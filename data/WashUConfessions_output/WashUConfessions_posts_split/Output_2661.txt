I've been staying away from hookups because I thought that if I waited patiently I'd find a girl who wanted a devoted and healthy relationship and who I could share my life with. There are girls who are interested in me, but I've been ignoring that because I wouldn't actually date them or because I know they hook up with other guys. And I want someone who's done with that stuff. 

But lately it just seems like everyone's hooking up and having meaningless sex. Even when someone says they want an actual relationship, when I get to know them well enough, I find out that they've actually been hooking up too.

So I've given up. I thought if I was patient and held myself to a different standard, I'd find someone else who felt the same way. But at this point, I've given up finding someone who wants something real.  I've been turning down sex pointlessly and I'm sick of waiting for nothing to happen.
