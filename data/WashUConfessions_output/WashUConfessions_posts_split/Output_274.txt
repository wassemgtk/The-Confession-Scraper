Found this letter folded up into square on the sidewalk outside the Snow Way garage across from the village. Don't know who dropped it, it wasn't signed, but it's beautiful and I felt like the writer understood what I feel, so I wanted to share. I hope it's not a dick move doing so. Anyway, here it is: 

Please remember me. Remember the moments we shared, the good and the bad. Remember that day at the Nelson Atkins Art museum, how time ceased to move and we stared into eternity hand in hand, and everything was alright. Remember the love that made the world and its endless problems disappear. remember the laughs, the ones that came without effort, from a place of purity in our hearts, because we could always share our unfiltered selves. Remember the moments of silence, when we got lost in each other and didn't care to know when we would be found. Remember the sound of my voice, the cries of my soul, the thoughts that we shared, and every crazy idea we ever had. Remember that there's always hope, that you're not alone, and that people love you. Please remember.
