I'm tired of being treated like a social pariah or like an intellectually challenged person for being an outspoken conservative. Hey progressives, I tolerate your beliefs, maybe you shouldn't judge me as a terrible person for mine! I care about the poor, in fact, I probably do more for them every week than most liberals on this campus have done in their lifetimes. Also, look around for pete's sake. The welfare state has done nothing to lift people out of poverty in this country. 70 years after FDR, and 50 after LBJ, our cities are still filled with people struggling to get by. For these people, Medicaid, disability checks, Social Security, and TANF aren't helping them make it in to the middle class, they only help them remain poor. WashU liberals, get over yourselves. Just because you voted for Obama doesn't mean you have the right to self-righteously blow each other for being great people.
