I had my heart broken about 9 months ago by my first love. I was supposed to be over this by now but as time passes, I still feel just as stuck and suffocated as before. I don't think I love him anymore; he's hurt me too much for that. But the pain from what he did to me still resonates. I can't help but feel cynical about the concept of love. He's left me feeling worthless when it comes to love and just completely unloveable and I hate that I've given him that much power but it's true. I see pictures of him with his new girlfriend and it just makes me wonder what made me not worth the effort. On December 31st, I told myself that it was the last time I would let myself cry over him, that 2015 was a new era for me, but here I am holding back tears. It makes me wonder if the cliche that it's better to have loved and lost than to never have loved at all is true because I was just so much happier and confident before.
