I've had a GPA high enough to make summa in the old system (read: 3.8) for four consecutive semesters including this one, however I am freaking out because during my first three semesters here I'm screwing up as hard as someone possibly can. Although my overall GPA is decent now and everyone talks about how GPA doesn't matter that much for grad school once you've passed a certain cutoff and they look at your growth and everything I'm still freaking out. I've been wanting to go to grad school since middle school (yes, you read correctly) and all the 18 programs I'm applying to are the most competitive programs in the country. I've looked at the incoming class average GPA and have been having nightmares ever since. If the first three semesters don't count I'll have a higher GPA than that crazy high average to be honest and I know applicants from some countries do have higher GPA than us and everything else about me, including standardized tests, are competitive but still. They are THE BEST programs in the country and I think they can afford to care about any tiny aspect of imperfection - not to mention my history is not an imperfection, it's a crack...what if the silly mistakes I've made when I was younger than 18 shatter my opportunities which would have a huge impact on the rest of my life? Really can't start imagining that...
Also, for those who have tried to convince me that I don't need to be in a top program to succeed as a professor, thank you and I get the idea, but I've worked so hard and I just won't and can't accept that the last stop of my education isn't a very prestigious institution. In academia where you get your PhD follows you for life. I want that to be a great school and I will not settle for second-tier.
