I confess that I don't even consider myself smart and capable anymore. Being surrounded by such bright peers is a privilege and I admire everyone's achievements, but it is also deeply intimidating. I try not to compare myself, but I am barely involved on campus, not particularly social, and just slave away simply to save face academically. I just haven't been beating the curves recently and as a result, put myself down. I wish I could be a bigger fish in a small pond. While I'm grateful for all the fantastic resources this university offers, I feel coursework is too demanding for me to take advantage. I'm graduating in the spring and feel my college experience is largely incomplete and that I haven't really grown during these four years due to academic obligations.  Every day, I criticize myself for subscribing to a system and a school that is so challenging and stressful, it's harmful to my health and personal development. This isn't the first time I've asked myself if the fancy degree is worth it, but it is the first time I'm starting to think not.
