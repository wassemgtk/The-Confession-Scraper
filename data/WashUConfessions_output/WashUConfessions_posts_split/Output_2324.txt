Sometimes I feel like I've committed myself to a business rather than to a school. 

Granted, I'm thankful for the financial aid that Wash U gave me, and I have had some amazing professors. But I can't help but feel like I'm just another student for the school to make money off of. I realize that this problem is true for all major colleges in the US, but the bottom line is that education shouldn't be a business. Not at Wash U, not anywhere. 

Unlike many of my peers and fellow students, I don't come from a rich family. I don't own a car and I've relied on public transportation for most of my life. Being forced to pay so much money for food and housing is a foreign concept to me, and it kills me to see so many people being able to easily afford the things I work so hard to have. 

I feel like I don't have the money to be able to enjoy Wash U properly. It makes me wonder if going to a private university was the right choice for me.
