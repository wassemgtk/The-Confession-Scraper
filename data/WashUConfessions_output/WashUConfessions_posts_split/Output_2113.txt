I am a student worker on campus, i know it's my duty to serve visitors, but all workers should be treated with respect! Today during my shift, a woman came to me and asked me where was a certain event that happened at 2. I looked up online, there was no event consistent with her description, so i asked her if there were other keywords that might be helpful for searching. She was really rude and said 'I don't think there is a lot of event happens at 2' with a super grumpy attitude. So I went over all event that happened at 2, there was again no correct result. I apologized that there was nothing i could find to help her, and suggested her to go to the department right next and to see if the event was there. She replied she just went there and the person there told her to come to me; and she asked me to CALL MY SUPERVISOR!!! Eventually, i found out that the name and time of the event she gave me were all wrong (that's why i couldn't find anything); and during the whole process she was harsh and mean like it was my fault her event didn't show up as she described. I have always love my job and i am happy to serve everyone, but to her, i would say, she is a totally bitch
