I confess that I'm both thrilled and terrified for sorority recruitment.  I feel like so much is riding on it; even though I love WashU, I haven't met people I feel really close to or people who make me really happy.  I've been counting on the fact that going Greek will introduce me to lifelong friends and an actual social life, but now I'm worried that I won't get into a sorority I want to be in, or even just not get into one at all.
If I'm not incredibly happy with being in a sorority, I'll wonder if I made the right choice by coming here.  I just don't know how else to find a close group of friends.
