I desperately need to get a job so that I have something to put on my resume. While I have done tasks and gotten paid  I have never had a "real job" or an internship. I went to the career center twice last year, but when I told the advisors that I had never had a job they just looked at me, almost disgusted and said "Charmed life." both times. It made me really uncomfortable.

I am very fortunate, but the way the advisors just kind of sent me away saying that they couldn't help and I should just scoop ice-cream over the summer so that I could put something on the resume at all. I did a summer program instead that really taught me amazing things and was an incredible experience. But now I've still never had a "real job" and I'm so embarrassed that I'm scared to go back to get help trying to make my embarrassingly short resume into something I could actually use to apply for internships.
