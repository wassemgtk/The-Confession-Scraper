to the guy in the a-stacks who actually cannot breath below a volume level of 20/25. you need to not be in the library or not be in the really quiet sections. you're actually incredibly distracting and I know you might be sick or something but please acknowledge all the people around you who now have to listen to your constant hyperventilating.
