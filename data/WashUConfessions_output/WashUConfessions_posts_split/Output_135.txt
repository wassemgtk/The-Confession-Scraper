My GPA dropped significantly this semester. I got the first C of my life this semester. I failed some exams this semester--badly. I deserve it all. And I'm oddly fine with it. I don't want this to become a habit. But it's a reality that I'm facing, learning from, and moving on, and that's all I can do.
