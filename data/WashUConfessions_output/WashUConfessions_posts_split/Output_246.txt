People used to question me about my habit of procrastinating when booking flights home for holidays and breaks (sometimes until the day before). Or why sometimes I would choose to stay at school rather than fly home. I used to say that it was because I was lazy -- it was the easy answer that got everyone to stop asking. 

But now I've graduated and I'd like to confess that I was/am having an immensely difficult time accepting the fact that one day I'll walk through my front door to see my mom and she wont recognize me. 

And each time I visit home I feel like I can see that day getting closer and closer and I haven't figured out how to handle that-- also the reason I chose not to talk about my family much, sorry. Lately I've sort of felt as though I'm growing apart from friends who I really cannot afford to lose; And a long time ago I used to be able to talk to my mom about any/everything, but now I don't know that I can, and I don't know that I have anyone else either.
