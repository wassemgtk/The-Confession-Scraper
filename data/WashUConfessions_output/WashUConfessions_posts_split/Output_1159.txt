I just found out my girlfriend cheated on me multiple times about a year ago, near the beginning of our relationship, and it hurts.  The guy was her ex.  It's been over a year since, but I feel like we've almost built our relationship on lies, and I'm not sure I can trust her anymore.  I love her, but I can't shake the paranoia, and it's just eating at me.  We've talked, but I just don't know how to move forward, or even if I should with her.  Help?
