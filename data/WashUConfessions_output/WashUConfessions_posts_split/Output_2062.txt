I confess I'm always a bit amused when I see activists and social justice warriors get so shocked when other people don't react positively to their messages. They tell people the proper way to think and feel and then call those people racists, bigots, et cetera if they don't share their rather binary and divisive worldview of oppressors and oppressed. Stop lumping people into different groups and telling them how to feel and you might get a better response.
