Sorry lock and chain people, but you look absolutely ridiculous walking around in those giant shackles. for a group of supposedly smart people, it amazes me that you all would wear something that could be interpreted as having connotations to slavery, supposedly as a way of "advertising events" (from lockandchain.org/aboutfaq.html) while I respect what your group does, and value traditions, it might be time to update the way you represent yourselves...
