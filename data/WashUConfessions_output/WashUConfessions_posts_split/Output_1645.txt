I am a girl and I just wanted to let all the men out there know how amazing it can be for girls to have guy friends. Recently I have felt so weary from all of my female friendships and I realize it's because all we freaking do is talk about our feelings all the time. While I love having so many feelings and they help me form close relationships with people, introspection, empathizing, and philosophical discussion are three of the most exhausting things on the planet. Sometimes I really don't want to freaking talk about weddings or whether or not I'm ready to start dating again or what I want to do for a career or how my shitty relationship with my parents is going (hint- it's probably still shitty) or about how I'm feeling that my grandma has cancer. Sometimes I just want to hang out and watch sports on TV and drink beer and talk about nothing important. Or not talk at all. So shout out to all the chill best guy friends out there--you are probably a wonderful relief to some of your girl friends with all the feelings and you probably don't even know it.
