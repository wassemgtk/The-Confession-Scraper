Really liked this guy and I asked him out to get to know him. Maybe it wasn't clear that it was a date, but afterwards we were just awkwardly friendly with each other, and nothing happened. I thought he liked me before, but maybe he realized he didn't. I guess I'll just get over him, but I don't like people as much as I liked him that often so now I just feel disappointed.
