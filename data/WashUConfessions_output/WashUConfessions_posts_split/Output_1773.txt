I just got my events for the second day of sorority rush back and I am incredibly disappointed. I only got invited back to two, only one of which I moderately liked. As a sophomore I had at least a few friends in each and thought my conversations went really well the whole day. I think I am an attractive and interesting person, so I don't understand what could've gone wrong. I don't understand how I didn't get invited back to any of my top choices. I was so nervous to come back to school, and now that this isn't working out, I am seriously considering withdrawing and going back home.
