After talking with friends and learning that their families can comfortable afford 100% of tuition and fees, I feel like less of a person because my family only pays ~20%. I thought most others got at least a LITTLE financial aid, but apparently I was wrong. I can't help but look at my friends as coming from such a privileged environment now, and I can't help but feel judged and looked down upon for having a work study job and struggling to pay bills.
