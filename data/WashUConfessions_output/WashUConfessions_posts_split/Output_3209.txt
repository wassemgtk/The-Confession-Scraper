I'm busier than I've ever been, taking on more work than I can ever do. I'm always at a loss for time. But you know what? I'm so happy doing it. I have plenty of things to complain about, that I'm sure others would complain about (workload, "bad vibe" of the school, whatever the other 600 confessions have been about). But every single thing I'm doing, I get to do because I genuinely want to do it. Even classes I "have" to take, there's quotes around it because I chose to do it. Complain all you want, but I could go on and on about all the things I study, but even longer about the things I want to study. Not everyone gets this chance, I'm just grateful that I get to have it. I guess I confess that it's discouraging to see so many others complain about having so much.
