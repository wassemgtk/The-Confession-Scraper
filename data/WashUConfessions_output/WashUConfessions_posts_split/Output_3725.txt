I was riding on the circ late one day and the girl behind me was talking about how horrible her day had been. The conversation went a little like this: "Today sucked so much. I had so much work to do. It was so gay. No, it was worse than that, it was faggoty." They laughed as if it was the funniest thing they'd ever seen. I didn't have the courage to stand up to them there, but jeez guys, think before you speak, you guys could've really offended someone. http://www.thinkb4youspeak.com/
