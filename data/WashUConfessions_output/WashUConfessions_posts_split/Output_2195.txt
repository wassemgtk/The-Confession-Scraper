I confess that I'm taking 21 credits this semester as a senior while applying to grad school, and will take another 21 next semester. Throughout my Wash U career I have never taken less than 18 credits. Same as the post (forgot it's number) on how much he/she wish people to stop judging because he/she is taking 12 credits, I really wish people to stop judging because I'm taking more than the average 15. I even had a professor who kicked me out of his lab because I was taking 18 credits the next semester (and my class load never got in the way of finishing lab work. Never.). After he let me back in the lab this semester, I accidentally told him I am taking 21 credits, and he lectured me for a full 45 mins on how I should go out and have fun and actually "live a life".

This drives me mad. Okay I am not the party and drink type, and I have never been to any party-party nor taste a sip of alcohol at Wash U. But that is my personal choice and I'm simply not a party person. I have a significant other, I spent a reasonable (maybe not) chunk of time playing video games and board games, I have finished a 10K and am preparing for a half marathon, and while I am indeed a little socially awkward, I do not have any problems with socializing with people or doing interviews. And above all, I am having a lot of fun at Wash U. I can graduate by the end of junior year but j choose to stay for senior year just because I love life here at Wash U and really don't want to leave. After all, I'm taking a lot of credits because I want to learn a lot of things outside my major which I probably will have a hard time finding a chance to learn post graduation, and these classes constantly make my day.
Calling for a bit more of understanding of personal choice from another side of story I guess.
