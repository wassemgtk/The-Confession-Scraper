I'm white. People tell me I'm entitled to all kinds of things and that I've always had it easy and it makes me feel awful. I grew up in a single family household with an often unemployed parent. The other is an alcoholic that I haven't seen since I was 10. My family didn't go on vacations, I've never had my own car, gifts on my birthday or at graduation are small, and I've been working since I was 14. I am in the lowest decile in terms of household income on campus, and I'm graduating with more debt than I know how to manage. All of my friends--white, black, minority, single-parented or otherwise--seem a whole lot better off than I am, but I'm too embarrassed to say how much it bothers me when they complain about not getting their parents to refill their campus card or going on a "bad" vacation to the Caribbean instead of Europe or buy them new clothes. I have never felt privileged or entitled to anything because of my skin color. Instead, I often feel compelled to lie because of what people have already assumed about my background. Getting an acceptance letter from WU was the luckiest day of my life. I don't know if being here is the financially responsible think to do, but I have never in my life been happier than when I am on this campus. I hate leaving and I always come back early. Skin color alone does not indicate the personal backstory of someone on this campus, but too many of you, no matter your skin color, jump to conclusions too fast. I know how conscientious and empathetic we can really be and I wish that would show through more, especially in times like these.
