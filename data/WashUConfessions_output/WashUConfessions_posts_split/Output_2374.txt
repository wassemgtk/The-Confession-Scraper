I confess that I didn't think that the death of my grandfather would hurt. I mean I didn't know him that well, and when I interacted with him the most he could barely talk because he had a stroke. Now, I can't help but to think of how he joked with me about how I look like my dad and he threw grapes and cheetos at me.

Sincerely,
A grieving girl
