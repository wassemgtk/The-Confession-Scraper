we are so incredibly socially aware here at wash u. when i talk to my high school friends at other schools, they are constantly saying things that are racist, sexist and the furthest thing from politically correct. and people just laugh it off. i think its good that these things cause tension at wash u. it provides an opportunity for activism and, at the very least, starts the conversation. i know we have a long way to go but at least we are trying.
