I am abroad right now, and quite frankly not interested in being friends with the other people in the program. They come from the same recruiting spread as WashU, but are not nearly as interesting as the people I know at WashU. On one hand, it makes me a bit sad for this semester, but on the other hand it makes really grateful for all the wonderful, hard working people here. You guys rock.
