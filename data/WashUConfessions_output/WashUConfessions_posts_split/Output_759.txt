I'm tired of the stigma attached to being a virgin. Why do men have to question why I'm a virgin when I tell them? I know that it's okay to be a virgin but I still feel bad hearing my friends talk about their sexual experiences while I have nothing to contribute. I shouldn't let something like this get me down but I feel like I need to lose my virginity before I graduate or else.
