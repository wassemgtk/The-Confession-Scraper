have asked if I'd consider starting the new Wash U Admirers page. I've been getting a number of confessions requests that are Admirers-style anyway. 

The short answer is: I'd love to, but not yet. 

The bottom line is that I don't know what's going on with the Admirers page administrator, and he/she could be going through personal issues in his life. That admin may or may not come back, but in the meantime, I shouldn't be trying to take their audience. So I don't feel like it's within my boundaries to try to revive the Admirers community - at least not right now. 

For now, I'm the Confessions administrator. Admirers is a different community, and I know what my boundaries are. Maybe after waiting a bit, if people would really like Admirers to come back, I could start that new page. But for now, I'm going to wait it out. 

So I can revive Wash U Admirers, but first, I'd really like to see if the old page is really defunct and how popular the demand for a new page is. Running pages takes time and web hosting costs money, but I'd be willing to do it after some time has passed if the community really wants it.
