I don't know what to do. I'm a pre med and I have terrible grades. My parents don't understand what college life like for me in America since they have not lived here. They don't understand that's WashU is a tough school and ridicule my grades. They tell me I am a failure and that I am not trying hard enough. They want me to grow up but they want to control my every action. My mom doesn't even know what WashU looks like. To top it all off I've relapsed into my eating disorder that I thought I had gotten away from and I am seriously scared that I'm going to end up dead somewhere. I hate myself and my life right now. I wish I could talk to my friends about it but they just can't understand because no one I know has ever been in a situation like this. I feel so alone and lost. I don't even know if being a pre med is right for me. I don't know if I want to be a doctor. Please help me.
