Dear Confessions Admin,

You replaced my first spoiler with your dinner entree so I have high expectations with this one. I read the books quite a while ago but I'm gonna try to ruin Game of Thrones for you. And then you can fill it in with some side dishes and whatnot:

[Bak choy] has a brother (not [pork loin] obviously) who is still alive and gunning for dat throne yall. Also [rice] comes back as a zombie at some point. Idk if that was already in the show or not, I know not these things. Honestly I feel like I could also just lie and say they all die and you would realistically believe me....

Thanks, bud. Have a fun night.
