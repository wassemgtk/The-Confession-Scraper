This may sound like a first world problem but I hate it when people assume I am rich. Sure, I may be upper-middle class but I don't think it's fair to assume some people are rich by saying it to their face. Many people would kill to be rich but when people assume I'm rich they associate it with being spoiled and not having to work for anything in life. My parents worked hard to be where they are now and I will have to too. I'm not a materialistic person and try to save money as often as possible so when people say "Oh but you can afford that because you're rich" in a condescending tone it ticks me off.
