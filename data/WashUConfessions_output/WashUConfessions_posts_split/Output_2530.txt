My birthday is coming up in about a week and I really hope to celebrate it properly this year. Every year so far I couldn't because I always had exams and now interviews as well, and so did my friends (everyone for that matter). I know it's probably too much to ask (Probably is for me) because my birthday is at such a bad time, but I'd like it if someone would surprise me and do more than just write happy birthday on my Facebook wall.
