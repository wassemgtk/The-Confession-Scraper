To err is human, and I must confess that I am very human. I have made many mistakes throughout my life, but none more serious than deciding to break up with my girlfriend earlier this year. I finally found someone who cared for me, made me happy, encouraged me, praised me, and always wanted the best for me. And then I made an extremely hasty decision, and lost all of that. It didn't take long for me to start regretting my decision. I have absolutely no idea what I was thinking breaking up with the one girl I have ever loved. I have tried so hard to get over it. I have tried to talk other girls, and it just feels so wrong. And I have to confess that I just cannot get over it. I honestly have no idea what to do. I love this girl and care for her so much, and yet I was the one to foolishly break up with her. I think about her all the time, and basically cry myself to sleep every night. And the worst part of this whole thing is that I know I did this. It is my own damn fault. I hurt her by breaking up with her, and knowing that I did that to her absolutely kills me on the inside. I would get back together with her in a heartbeat, but I'm afraid that I will never be able to win her back. Seeing her talk and flirt with other guys feels like someone is repeatedly stabbing me in the heart. And that someone is me, because I know that I did this to myself. I can't open a book or turn on the TV or leave my house without thinking about her. I see her in everything I do, and I can't ever get her out of my head. What am I supposed to do?
