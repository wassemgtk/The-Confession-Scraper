I confess that I don't understand the point of WUSAs? As a freshman, I have become friends with my WUSAs but I don't see what role they actually play past orientation. I mean I enjoy the food they bring to my floor. It seems to be part of the trend I have seen in meaningless leadership roles at WashU. I still feel like I'm going to apply to boost my resume just like every other freshman who applies.
