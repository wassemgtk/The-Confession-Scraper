I am a humanities major because it is what I love. Engineers, pre-meds, general sciences, and architecture students please don’t criticize me for doing what I love. I scored a 36, 2380, and 13 5’s (including BC and all of the sciences). I could have pursued any of your chosen fields and done just fine. I shouldn’t care, but I confess that jeers of “Arts and Crafts”, “Worthless Major”, and “Easy” do get under my skin. So please, study what you want to study. Do what you love. Let me do what I love without criticizing me. I respect you for your dedication, work ethic, and intelligence. However, I don’t have any respect for maliciousness. Tearing down others for who they are, even if in such a trivial way, is sad and upsetting. We are all worthwhile people who matter, regardless of what our diploma says and regardless of whether or not we have one at all.
