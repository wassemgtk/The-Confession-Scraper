Rapes happen. Not just in the stories we heard in health class in high school or the brutal rapes we hear about on the news. They happen here, on campus. Should they? Of course not. Rape is never okay, it is never excusable. This is a problem. This is an enormous problem, and I'm asking the Wash U community to recognize and acknowledge that it needs to be addressed so that things can change. It is not okay. Students should feel safe here.
