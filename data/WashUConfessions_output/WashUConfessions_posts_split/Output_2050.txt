So I've been going to hella social justice things this semester and I decided to research gender and I think I may be gender queer? I realized that I don't reeallly believe in gender. Then it hit me that I don't feel like a dude. I used to identify as male but now it just doesn't feel right. Am I defining gender queer right? Do I have to come out as gender queer? I don't really like the whole "they/them or zee/zir" thing but he/him just doesn't seem to fit. I think I'll stick to he/him only because it's easier but idk. I don't think I should go to Pride or something because this isn't a gay/straight thing. Anyone have thoughts because I'm at a loss.
