Talking for all Wash U athletes, we do not come here for the notoriety. We come here because we love the game. If you think any differently, you do not really know us. We have all the opportunities similar to you, less time to study but yet we are in the same classes. All of us could have gone to a state school, got a decent education and just partied all the time. Instead, we decided to continue to the play the game we love. Would it be nice if more people came to games, sure. But we do not play so we are the celebrities on campus, we play to bring Wash U honor and bring championships to this school.
