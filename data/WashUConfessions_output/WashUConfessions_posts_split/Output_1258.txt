My partner and I are breaking up.  Graduation opened our eyes about what would really happen if we tried to stay together.  Words cannot express the pain I feel thinking about losing my best friend.  I have never been so underwhelmed about my future or life.  Moving on to the next stage of my life without them feels more like dying and being born as someone else than a happy mark of progress.  And I know I have to let them go because they desire too much I cannot give them.  Finishing school this year seems impossible, and I'm sincerely worried I will fail my classes.  Emptiness consumes me.  And I don't really care what happens next.
