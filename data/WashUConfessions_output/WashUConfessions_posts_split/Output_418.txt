This weekend I was talking to my friends about the 2016 presidential election and some of them said they would vote for Donald Trump because it would be fun. I have known these people for 3 years, we have a ton of memories together and I love them, so this is not a hate speech against them. I really want to understand something.

We all are getting a great education at WashU that most people on earth can't afford. We are taught about global issues, philosophy, we learn logic, reasoning and critical thinking. After all that why would any of us want to vote for Donald Trump? Have we not heard the stuff he says? I understand if a 70 year old racist grandpa supports him, or if a person who is ignorant about politics, or someone with vested interest supports him. But why would an intelligent college student want Donald Trump as their next president? Is it because what he says feeds your inner monster and brings out the worst in you?

About Ben Carson, why would you want a person who wants a Christian nation? Aren't we all granted freedom of religion by the Constitution? Are the church and the state not separate as defined by the constitution? I am a liberal and I really want to have an honest and open conversation about this with anyone interested. I want to understand where the other side is coming from, bypassing all the hate and name-calling. Peace and love, ya'll!
