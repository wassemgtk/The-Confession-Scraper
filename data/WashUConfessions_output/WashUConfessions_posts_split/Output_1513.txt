I matched a girl on Tinder who was really sweet and I enjoyed talking to her. However she goes to school a few hours away so I  mentioned that I'm a fish swimming in a different sea. She pointed out that all the seas are connected so I countered by saying I'm like Nemo, I have one weak fin preventing me from swimming far. A few hours later I found out that she had half her arm amputated. She  hasn't talked to me since, and I feel like an ass.
