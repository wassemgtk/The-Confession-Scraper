My girlfriend has been trying for her entire life to get into med school, focusing all of her energies during undergrad to get a decent GPA and high MCAT scores. Now, she still isn't accepted and I feel like she's changing into a different person, someone I don't like. 

How can I help her? Also cause we're both graduating and thinking about doing long distance, I'm not sure if that's a good idea. I wouldn't usually post here, but I have no one else to turn to. I don't want to tell my friends or they'll know, but would really like some advice.
