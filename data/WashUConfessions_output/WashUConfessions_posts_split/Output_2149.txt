I confess that I'm intensely uncomfortable at parties, so uncomfortable that I enter a vicious cycle of discomfort, drinking to cope, and worse discomfort from drinking while upset. I keep going because friends want to go, because of a rare few times where I've had a good time, because what else can I do on weekends, and because where else can I try (but fail) to get sexual gratification. I'm not here to bash so-called "hookup culture", or party culture. I just wish there were a place for me, in them or somewhere else.
