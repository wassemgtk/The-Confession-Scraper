Reslife housing couldn't be more messed up. Those unassigned in round 2 and wanting to stay within the reslife system get to apply to round 3, but are at the bottom of the rankings. So we don't get our first choice, but we get to be put on lowest priority for an area we weren't even thinking about living in, now our only option? How is that even remotely fair? Get it together reslife.
