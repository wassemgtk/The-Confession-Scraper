Not to use this platform as a soapbox (and I wouldn't be the first), but it makes me very uncomfortable when people post lost student IDs to facebook groups. It can be humiliating, especially if you say where you found it (which doesn't help at all because everyone knows to whom the ID belongs). We all got in to this school. We all know how to find people. Honestly I think it comes from social anxiety that people would post those photos rather than try to reach out to whomever the ID belongs (or to give it to WUPD). For the love of common sense can we PLEASE stop pulling this crap?
