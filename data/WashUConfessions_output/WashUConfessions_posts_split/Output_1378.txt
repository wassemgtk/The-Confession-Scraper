If any incoming freshmen follow this page, I hope you get the chance to read this.

WashU is a great school. It's been called "Harvard of the Midwest" among other titles. Sadly it's still not as big a household name like many other top schools in US News despite ranking higher than several of them. Before I started here, people have told me time and time again that even though the average person doesn't know about WashU, the people who matter do (i.e. Employers, grad school admissions, etc.). Well here I am, 4 years later, working at a Fortune 50 company, and practically no one in my office has heard of WashU, nor do I think they care. But the strangest part might be the fact that I really don't care either.

You might find this shocking but this is the truth of the post-college world that I learned about towards my senior year: people who boast about what school they went to give off the impression that their best accomplishments are behind them. The only time I mention it is when people specifically ask me and even then, I might just say "I went to school in St. Louis."

Similarly, in light of catching up with some buddies now in med school and reading some recents posts about med school, I've thought about the value of going to a prestigious school, and I know that it's both an asset and a liability.

Telling people you go to WashU projects the image that you're smart/talented/elitist. The challenge is going to how to back up that image; not an easy task when you'll be surrounded by peers with similar capabilities. The reason I bring this up is because I've heard countless times of people thinking it's okay to keep getting B's and C's in classes because they go to WashU. Well it's not okay. When an employer or grad school admissions looks at your transcript, going to WashU won't compensate for a GPA of barely 3.0 or below, especially you're likely going to be competing with a classmate who has a GPA of 3.5+.

My point is if you're going to attend a school like WashU, make sure that you can handle it. Like it is with many other top tier schools, students here are held to a very high standard. When you choose to come to such a school, you made a commitment, and applying for a job or grad school with a subpar GPA means you've failed to follow through on your own commitment. Similarly, stop telling your friends or yourself when you do poorly on a test that it's fine because you're at WashU. Don't delude yourself by thinking a B/C here is like an A+ at some other school; a B/C is a B/C everywhere you go unless you're comparing yourself to an institution that uses a different grading criteria.

I say this because I know what it's like to be a recent high school grad enticed by the thought of going to a prestigious college. I've learned now, perhaps a little too late, that no matter what happens, you have to earn your own success, and you won't accomplish that by sitting around thinking it'll all come to you simply because you go to WashU.
