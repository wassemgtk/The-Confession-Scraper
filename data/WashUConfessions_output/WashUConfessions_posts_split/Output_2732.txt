Follow up to 1089 and 1090, have you considered that people have preferences regarding who they're attracted to and aren't required to find you attractive even if the reason is from your point of view "shallow"? I can understand the hypocrisy of overweight people being averse to dating other overweight people, but no one is obligated to find you attractive even if you demonstrate qualities that can be considered attractive. I worked my ass off to get in shape and I work my ass off to STAY in shape and I don't see any reason why I should have to change my standards to accommodate for someone that lacks the same work ethic I have. It took a hell of a lot of work to get myself to change my lifestyle to get to a healthy weight, you can do it too. Get something like MyFitnessPal on your smart phone and start counting calories and set it to "Sedentary" or "lightly active". Differences in metabolism only account for something like +/- 200 calories a day. Unless you have a condition that requires you to eat a certain amount per day you have no excuse. If you're happy the way you are, then I'm glad you are able to be confident in yourself as you are. Just because you're happy with who you are doesn't mean I have to be attracted to you.
