(Admin, please, please post this.)
I was surfing the website before I bumped into an article by this blogger called SciBabe (side note: she's awesome.). It talks about pro-ana websites so I clicked onto the link.

I was terrified.

I was EDNOS for a while and bulimic for a while...without a formal diagnose though. There was one month in which I ate ~300 calories and then purged, exercises 3 hours compulsively, and weighed myself a dozen times a day. I was at my lowest weight in the last decade by the end of the month. But I was miserable...the damage done to my self-esteem has still not been repaired after 3 full years. I still use food as reward and punishment, still binge when I feel rejected, have suicidal thoughts now and then.

And most importantly...the amount of weight I lost in that miserable month was exactly the same as I did in the past 3 weeks (I regained a lot of the weight back in the last 3 years). For the last 3 weeks, I exercised every day for around an hour, and ate a hot dinner afterwards. I did count calories but I've never went below the recommended guideline from scientific resources. I did not avoid food - including fried chicken tenders sometimes, just ate everything in moderation. And now I felt a lot more in my own body, beated my PR by a lot, and hadn't had suicidal thoughts for a good while.

I am willing to admit that I still care about my shape, and to a lot lesser extent, weight. I do want to look good, impress people, gain confidence. But even if you've decided to try pro-Ana tips because of the exact same reason (as what a lot of the comments on the website state)...please, please do not do that. I believe you've heard enough about the health consequences. But even if you say you don't care about that...an eating disorder is not going to take you to wherever you want. You want to be thin/look good for some reason right. ED does not help with any of these. People are just wired to be a lot happier exercising and eating than not exercising and starving. And your BMR slowed down so much when you go below 1000 calories a day. Not worth it. Really.
For the people who said "blame the media for imposing this on us, who the hell want an ED if that's not what your standards of beauty"...a) ED is hugely genetic. Pushing all the responsibility onto media does not do justice for people who had ED. And besides that...if you think that's unrealistic, why do you keep doing that? Check out the photos of athletes. Human beings naturally have appreciation for certain body types for evolutionary reasons - but definitely, absolutely not the deathly thin type. Beauty is associated with power.

I'm heartbroken when I read through those comments...i think every recovered ED patient would want to rest of the world to know that it's a way to never fall into. If there are anyone who read this who are on those websites...please stop. That's my heartfelt plea.

Sorry for the long rant.
