Hello again, hope you're well! I have a proposition for you. First off, I totally get WashU Confessions isn't the place for people to preach their ideas or market whatever event/student group they want. That being said, I think it might be helpful for students to know that there is a place to make the kind of changes they hope for. Please consider the following post: Do you think "social just warriors" are entitled and isolating? Then do something about it. Apply to the Social Justice Center (SJC)'s Leadership Council. The due date has been extended to this Sunday the 22nd at 11:59pm. Apps can be found at sjc.wustl.edu If you feel this is out of your jurisdiction, I completely understand. Thanks!
