I've been on leave from school for a little while now and I've finally decided I'm not going back. I'm not sure if it's college in general that is driving me away or WashU specifically. Honestly things seem pretty high school a lot of the time here and it makes me feel like an asshole that I'm bothered so much by it. I feel bad that I'm giving up my opportunities at such a great school but I know in my heart that it's the right decision. I'm telling my parents this weekend. Wish me luck.
