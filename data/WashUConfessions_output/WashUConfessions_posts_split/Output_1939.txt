Without delving into the complexities of the current issues on our campus and around the country and world, I would like to say that I think it's messed up that people change Black Lives Matter to All Lives Matter.  Seriously?  Black people can't have this one thing?  Do white people (and others) feel so left out that they need to insert themselves in?  I understand that all lives matter, and so does everyone else.  No one is saying ONLY black lives matter.

This is a black issue.  Black people are being treated unfairly and unequally and that's the whole point of the movement and protest.  All Lives Matter seems to be a selfish attempt to make it about yourself if you're not black.  It is, at best, completely missing the point, and, at worst, sarcastic and disrespectful.

I believe All Lives Matter is yet another attempt to silence black voices in our country, making it all the more important to assert: Black Lives Matter.

If it matters, I'm white.
