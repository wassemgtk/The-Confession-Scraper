I'm a guy with a lot of female friends. Since I'm usually the token male in a group of chicks, I regularly get to hear about the latest piece of hunk that's caught the fancy of my friends. Now I have no problem with this (cause c'mon guys do it too.) but until recently, it did kind of make me feel pretty bad about myself y'know? Those guys seemed so perfect, so Adonis-like. I felt like I could never compete with them. I still feel that way actually, hahah this was supposed to be like an uplifting confession about living for yourself  beyond comparison of self to others but, nooope still feel shitty. I'm not really sure what to do about it.
