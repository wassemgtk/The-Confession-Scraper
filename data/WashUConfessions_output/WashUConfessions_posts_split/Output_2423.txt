I'm sick of people referring to me as "big". I'm 5'8", and somewhere around 140 pounds. I work out for over an hour a day. And yeah, sometimes I like some french fries. But I'm not fat, not by health standards and not by world standards. Every time someone tells me I just have a "big body" or "large shape", I feel like shit because there's almost nothing more I can do. There reaches a point where losing weight for me will actually be unhealthy. Guys try and pick me up, and they groan, even though I told them not to try. I feel fine when I wake up in the morning, but by the time I go to sleep I hate my body. I'll never be beautifully stick thin, but I don't need everyone constantly reminding me.
