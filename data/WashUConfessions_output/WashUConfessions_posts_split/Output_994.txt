I hate my penis. When I look at my body in the mirror, it is the only thing I am ashamed of, and it is by far my greatest insecurity. My female friends talk about how much they want a huge dick, and I'm just stuck thinking that I'll never be big enough to truly satisfy a woman. I never even tried to hookup with random women out of a crippling fear that we'd get to third base and she would look at my penis and decide it was too small. Eventually, I found a girlfriend, but even then I made her wait to have sex under the premise of me not being ready yet, but in reality it was because I didn't want her to see my penis. She always tells me that she thinks its a good size, but I just can't believe her. Its gotten to the point where it is constantly on my mind, and it always gets me down, and I can't take it anymore. I wouldn't dare talk about this to anyone, so I'll ask here, anonymously, what should I do?
