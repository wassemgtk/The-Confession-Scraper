By no means do I condone the actions that were done on Tuesday night. However, this has been completely overdone by social media, making it a hate crime and defamation. This is absolutely ridiculous and exaggerated, the photo of the scavenger hunt can explain this clearly. In terms of discrimination and the problem on this campus, I recognize that it is the problem. However, when there is an all black table at the DUC, where if a white person sits down, they are immediately stared it, part of this segregation is done by them. If a person just wanted to have a conversation or meet some new people at this table, this would currently be considered ludicrous and looked down upon. This segregation is down by the people who believe they are currently being segregated. To say that no one knows what it is like to come from an underprivileged family is ridiculous. Once you are at Wash U, everybody has the exact same opportunity as the peers to get a world-class education. There are white people that are currently drowned in student debts because their family cannot pay for their education. Meanwhile, there are people in the Irving Scholars program who are getting the college partially paid for, not ever having to worry about paying this money back. Everybody has their own particular problems or hardship, some are more easier to see than others. However, to label the actions performed as a hate crime or defamation, as a result of the segregation or lack of opportunity on the Wash U campus, is completely false. The kids screwed up and they apologized. While this may not be enough, it is better than nothing. Don't be out for blood, we are all part of the same community.
