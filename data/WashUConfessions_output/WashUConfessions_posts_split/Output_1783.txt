I think I'm becoming desperate about finding a guy. It's been so long. And the other day my friend told me that I'm too picky about the guys that I date. But I always thought I wasn't supposed to have to settle for a guy. Now I'm thinking of getting back together with this guy who I only broke up with because I didn't like him that much (I like him as a person, just no strong romantic feelings). But he's a great guy and maybe I should just accept that and believe that I'll grow to like him. Because maybe this is my only chance. And I just don't want to end up alone...
