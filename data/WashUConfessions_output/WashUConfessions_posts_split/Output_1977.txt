I confess that I find it hypocritical that Chancellor Wrighton said "we have fallen short in creating an environment where everyone feels respected, honored and safe" and condemns people for posting anonymously in Yik-Yak and Wash U Confessions in the same letter. His exact words said something about people using anonymity to use racist, bigoted words, but I haven't seen that at all, especially on Wash U Confessions. I'm sorry that not everyone supports the Ferguson protests, but that doesn't make everyone who disagrees with the movement racist. Am I the only one who has never seen anything on Yik Yak or Wash U Confessions that has been racist? Or at least that hasn't been immediately down-voted if it was? I find it very disappointing that Wrighton doesn't recognize that students are SCARED to share their opinion because of one reason or another on campus. I find it disappointing that the head of our university has taken a side on the issue, making it even more difficult for me to openly share my opinions. Most importantly, I find it disappointing that any opposition to the Ferguson movement has, as solidified by Wrighton's letter, been labeled as racist.

I always hear. "Attach your words to your name." That's easy enough for you to say; you don't have to face ostracism or labeling because the public agrees with you. I genuinely fear that I could lose a job opportunity if I posted some of my ideas openly. I don't feel like I can have an open discussion about this; I feel like none of the leaders of the movement want to hear people with different ideas than them.
