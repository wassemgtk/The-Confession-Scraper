I make jokes about suicide every so often, and that has definitely happened a lot more with finals going on (eg "Ugh I'm going to kill myself after this paper is finished). The thing is, I was suicidal for a long time. I never actually made the attempt, but I came what I consider worryingly close. The reason I make these jokes is really as a kind of mental catharsis. I'm no longer in the place where I genuinely feel afraid of this, and joking about it is a kind of quiet mental victory. Like I CAN joke about this, because it isn't the big scary dragon in my mind anymore, just a pathetic little worm that doesn't control me anymore, The thing is, a lot of my friends don't know about this, so I feel like they may be genuinely worried about the amount of suicide jokes I've been making. It's led to some inescapably awkward situations.
