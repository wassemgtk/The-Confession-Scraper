I think the new eco-to-go system is going to backfire horribly. Is it really to-go if you have to take it back? Like, how is it any different from a plate? Plus you have to wait in line to get it swiped back in. I think people are just going to steal plates. Big mistake, dining services. There's a reason to-go boxes exist.
