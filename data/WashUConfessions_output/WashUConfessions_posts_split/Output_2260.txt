Posts #1562, 1561, 1560 and 1559 absolutely blew my mind away though I'm too scared to comment or "like" any of them. But seriously you guys, the four of you gave me hope for this country when I thought there was none. We need to take back freedom of speech and have real debates without being afraid of the PC police! I am truly inspired.
