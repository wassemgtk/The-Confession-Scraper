I have a huge crush on one of my best guy friends, but of course he's completely oblivious to it. Sometimes I just want to sound one mighty, resounding barbaric YAWP, walk up to him, and plant one on him. Then, I'd walk away pumping my fist in the air like Judd Nelson at the end of The Breakfast Club while intense 80's music plays in my head.
