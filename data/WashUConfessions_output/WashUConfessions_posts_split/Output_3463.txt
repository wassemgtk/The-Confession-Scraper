I often feel really lonely on campus. I don't have a core group of friends and it's even more discouraging when WashU tries to prevent any more of my kind from ever stepping foot on campus. Whenever people see me on campus, I get looked down upon and it gets really frustrating. Like I know you're looking out for the University's best interests, but I have feelings, too. I just want to be accepted! And I feel likea lot of the time, people just use me for their own pleasure and then just throw me in the recycling. Please guys, I'm begging you... accept me back on campus! True Life: I'm a Wash U Bottled Water.
