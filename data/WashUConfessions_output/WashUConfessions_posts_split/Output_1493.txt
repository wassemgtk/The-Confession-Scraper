As a Chinese citizen that has been in America for a good four years, I have to admit I have yet to see any long term collaboration/coexistence between the international students and the American kids. The two groups are almost mutually exclusive of each other. Chinese students often avoid Americans while the latter also ignores the international population quite a bit. As part of the 0.5 generation I'm in the position that I feel comfortable between each group, but I could never find a sweet spot that brings the two together. I understand there are cultural differences and things but I've always had the mentality that coming abroad for school is as much a cultural experience as a academic experience. Just wondering if anyone feels the same way.
