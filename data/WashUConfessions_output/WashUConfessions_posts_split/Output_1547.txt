I confess that I've never had sex without having at least a couple drinks (and usually way more) in me. I just read a Slate article about the difficulties of determining whether drunk sex should be considered rape or not, and it reminded me of an earlier confession here about the Studlife stats. I remember the consent workshops in orientation and stuff and always being told that you can't consent if you're intoxicated--but does anyone seriously believe this? If this is true then if I get drunk with a guy (or girl) and have sex with them, then we raped each other. See how this doesn't make sense? We need to have more nuance in how we discuss alcohol, sex, and consent.
