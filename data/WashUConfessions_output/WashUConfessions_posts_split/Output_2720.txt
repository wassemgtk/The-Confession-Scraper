I'm 20 and I've never been kissed by anyone... I'm not desperate or anything (and I would never hook up with a guy if no real feelings are involved) but it just makes me sad seeing my friends with their significant others and I can't help but wonder if I'm just doing something wrong. They tell me I'm perfect the way I am... they tell me to just be myself, but sometimes being yourself is just not good enough. Empty words like those doesn't fill that empty space in my heart when I'm left in the suite alone while all my suitemates went on dates with their boyfriends.
