I confess that I don't hook up and I don't date much. I'm really shy. But last week a crush of mine in my class offered to carry my books and asked me out. It was the sweetest, most romantic thing I had ever experienced. I mean he followed through with asking me out perfectly, like I had always envisioned it.

Our first date was amazing. There was plenty of mystery and a lot of flirting; and then the second date (the next week) was even better. I don't usually like to jump into feelings. But he acted like he was crazy about me. He even said so. And honestly, everything he revealed about himself was everything I ever wanted. He talked about the future, meeting my family, and having a relationship.

Then halfway through the night he pulled me aside and told me he wasn't "the relationship type" and that he couldn't keep dating me because he had an open relationship with a girl who had been sleeping with him for a year.

My feelings: lead on, humiliated for showing so much public affection, foolish for believing that the guy of my dreams could even exist and stupid for thinking that something that too good to be true could really happen to me. I just want to disappear. I wish I could lock myself in my room with my pasta and my books.

It's not even about missing the guy or wishing he was mine. She can have him. I don't like liars. It's about not seeing something so fake right before my eyes. I don't think that I'll ever date again.
