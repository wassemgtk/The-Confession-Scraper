I wish there was an easier way to identify what foods have what allergens in them on campus. Some triggers are more obvious, like gluten or peanuts, but other less common allergens are often still in foods without being in the ingredients lists. Sure, a good portion of the food does have the correct nutrition labels (if you can find it online), but it would be nice to know that, say, a certain nut oil extract is in the bread or that they changed the soup recipe without updating the online menu. Next year I'll have the luxury of cooking everything for myself, but right now I'm just perpetually frustrated and craving all this food that may or may not make me break out in hives.
