I want to go to go to medical school and become a dermatologist to live a comfortable life. But I stumbled on someone's status about their journalism project and it's making me think. I don't know, is it immoral to want to have a enjoyable, comfortable life?

The person's status - "With my project, I hope to show that there is something terribly wrong with the world. In a world driven by profits, children in poor countries die because their parents don't have one dollar for medicine. This summer in Uganda, stunned from listening to story after story of people dying from the lack of trivial amounts of money and from the inaccessibility of the most basic medicine, I had the insensitivity and the presumption to ask a mother who lost two of her five children to easily treatable malaria whether the grieving process is easier because it is expected that some children will not survive to five years of age. I'll never forget her sad and slighted gaze at me as she said "no, we never forget. It always hurts."

As a future physician, a world in which some can receive the right to live as a birthright while others that toil in the fields all year have to helplessly watch their loved ones needlessly die makes me angry. I think a doctor is a natural advocate for the voiceless. The poor have the worst health outcomes and the highest health needs, so it is logical that a doctor, who is sworn to view each life as equally valuable, should do all they can do to help the poor. However, the broken system permeates into every sector of society and commodifies everything, including medicine, making a moral duty impractical and unfashionable. But even within this broken system, with more, yet still modest investment by the wealthy, the stories of those that I told this summer would have never needed to happen.

I think defending the voiceless and the marginalized is the fight of our generation. And maybe with enough willpower, we can fix this broken world
