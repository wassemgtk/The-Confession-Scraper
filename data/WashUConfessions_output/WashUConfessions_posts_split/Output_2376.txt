The first month here was good. But recently it's come back again. And I've just come to the realization that this--depression--will never ever fully go away. I can fight it off, with support systems and counseling and meds--but it will never leave me, not completely, and I will constantly have to watch for it, live under  this shadowy fear for the rest of my life.

I have been fighting for too long. For so much of my life. And I am growing weaker, more tired. I know I was a burden on my closest friends last semester. They don't need to go through this again.
