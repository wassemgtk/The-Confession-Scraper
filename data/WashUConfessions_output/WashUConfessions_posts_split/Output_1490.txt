Having gone to a state school as an undergrad, where frats and sororities were a relatively big scene but by no means the pinnacle of the college experience (and generally for the less academically motivated), I must say I am baffled by the amount of undergrads at a superior institution caught up in that stuff.  To be fair,  I am basing this purely off the confessions I see on this page, which may not be representative of the overall student body.  However, after weeks of seeing these posts, I've finally been compelled to comment on this and just let you guys know that most people go through college without it and are perfectly happy. Life goes on, you'll find your own way, and sometimes that's more satisfying.
