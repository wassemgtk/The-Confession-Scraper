A year ago, I was drugged and raped. I don't remember anything and I don't know who it was--I woke up the next morning, grabbed my shit, and left before he got up. Since then, I've walked around campus wondering if I'm in the same room as my rapist, if he's in any of my classes, if he may have graduated or gotten kicked out (part of me hopes he did), if I've ever spoken to him and if he knows who I am. Part of the reason I'm submitting this is because I'm tired of hiding it and I want people to know. Keeping this secret has been destroying me for the past year. Finally, I'm at peace with it. I don't blame myself, I don't think I'm a slut, and I'm not looking for help. I'm healing, and ready to take action, if nothing more yet than anonymous action. So the other part of the reason is for awareness. People try to bring up sexual assault time and time again but I feel like no one listens on this campus. Wash U's hookup culture, while it can be fun, isn't for everyone, and it can be dangerous. Because it is more or less assumed that everyone wants to hook up all the time, we don't seek the consent that we should and the percentage of people, not just women, who have been subjected to nonconsensual and forced sexual encounters is remarkably high. Date rape drugs are more rampant than we realize. This is heartbreaking to me and we can't let this keep happening. Stand with me and fight it. Hopefully I'll find the courage to speak publicly but this is the best I can do right now, so we need to work together for my sake, for the sake of everyone else who is a victim, and for the sake of everyone who will be a victim if we don't address this problem.
