I confess that I am a left-leaning moderate on campus.  Sure, I read some of the more "conservative" posts on this page and disagree with them.  But do you know what I do about it?  I read them, think about them, decide whether or not I agree, and then move on with my day.  Just wanted to let everyone thinking along the same lines as #2414 know that there are some of us who would be broadly categorized as "liberals" who do actually consider your opinions for what they are without getting upset about it and trying to shame you or force you to change your mind.
