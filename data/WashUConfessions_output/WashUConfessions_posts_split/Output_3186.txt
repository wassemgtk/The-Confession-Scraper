Cheating is a cruel, cowardly thing. It has the potential not only to break the heart of one victim, but three. I cheated on someone I truly loved, and I will regret it every day of my life. But this post is not about me: I want to respond to the 'friend' who recently posted. First off, to show concern is a legitimate reaction. NO ONE ever deserves to be cheated on, and I think the boyfriend has a right to know. That being said, I think it best for you to approach your friend before you make any moves. People do cowardly things like cheating as a cry for help, or because they naively don't realize the consequences/gravity of their actions. This doesn't make it right, but I think you should give your friend the opportunity to 'right' as much wrong, herself, as she can. I'm sure she does not feel good about herself and is in denial and/or afraid to make those moves, and using avoidance as a coping mechanism to reduce cognitive dissonance. We, as a culture, condemn cheaters, and rightfully so, but may fail to realize the internal conflict of a cheater and easily write them off as if the act of cheating alone reflects their character. If this girl is truly your friend, I'm sure she is your friend for a reason (i.e. has redeeming qualities) and will come to see what's right with a little of your help. Good luck.
