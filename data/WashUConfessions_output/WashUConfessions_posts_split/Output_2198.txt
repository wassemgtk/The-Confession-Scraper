Being a PhD student at WashU makes me feel quite lonely most of the time. It is especially separated from the student community when you stay in Med School campus everyday. When I was back home from work, I just did not have people to talk to. I was very outgoing a person at my college period. But now I become more and more silent. I always wanted to make new friends and hang out with them. But I just did not have a chance to meet people, which is really sad. It takes another three or four years for me to graduate and I really don't want such situation to last that long. Really hope someone can help me with that.
