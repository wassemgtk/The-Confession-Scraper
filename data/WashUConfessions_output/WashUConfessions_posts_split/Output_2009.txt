My friend just got out of a felony warrant without bail in 3 days by supposedly posting a 15k cash only bail when shes broke, and when she also should have been picked up and held by 3 other police stations for other felony charges upon release from the one she was at.  I'm pretty sure I just got snitched out (it was no bail cause last time I got her arrested she bailed and ran). And I still don't feel anything except being glad she's out.  Yet she refuses to talk to me because she thinks I put her in there this time too.
