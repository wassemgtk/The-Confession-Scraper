I discovered evidence that a professor had altered research results. I didn't say anything because the research wasn't anything groundbreaking, and there's always a chance that I could have been wrong. I took steps to verify that the results were likely fabricated, but in the end I realized that it wasn't worth the trouble to bring it up, especially since the professor is a relatively nice person. I feel guilty for not disclosing it, but I'm selfish and made the right choice to make sure I wouldn't lose my references for jobs or graduate school.
