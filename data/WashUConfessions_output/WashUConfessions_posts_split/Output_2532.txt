After not having done laundry in a month and realizing that I actually have enough clothes (and underwear at that) to not have to do laundry for a month (I could actually make it through like another week without laundry), I'm pretty sure I have a problem. I shop to deal with my depression and anxiety, and my constant feeling that I'm not pretty enough to warrant someone's attention. I'm spending money much faster than I make it, and I'm scared that once I leave college it's going to get worse. I just can't help but feel that I'm walking down a dangerous road, and I won't be able to get off of it.
