I was in the happiest relationship of my life this summer, but it ended. We tried hanging out as friends after the breakup, and she mentioned that she had always preferred white guys. It wasn't the reason why we broke up, but it was still hard to hear especially since we just ended the relationship.

Whenever I see an asian girl with a white guy, it still makes my heart sink. It makes me feel like I'll never be someone's "preference".
