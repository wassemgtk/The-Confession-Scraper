I never have a strong body because of a genetic health problem. But i have never told anyone here how weak my body is.
Every time I go through a physical test, I feel exhausted. When I told someone how I felt today, that person kept giving me reactions like I was making a big deal out of it, and said if I couldn't go through this I could never do (something else).
I just wanna say it is not my fault that my body is not operating in a way i want it to be. And it's tough especially when it's final week. I just want someone to show even a little care, or at least some respect.
