I believe that I met my true love while at WashU.  Now that I and my love are both gone from school, despite my sadness and loneliness, I look back on our times very fondly.  Current and future students, I am so sorry that you will not get to feel the joys that I have felt.  Connie screwed you all. #savethemozzsticks
