I don't know if it's more humorous or scary that the administration blocked aWILDnight.com. Sometimes I feel like we're living less in a free-thinking University and more in a Saudi Arabian autocracy. The site promotes sexual assault? If anything, having 2 consenting adults say they are interested in one another when SOBER prior to WILD's commencement would mitigate the issue of sexual assault during WILD. It looks to me as if the school is just concerned that it might have the image of a place where people hook up as opposed to just study all day. God forbid we lose any resemblance to UChicago, the school the administration is trying to emulate and slowly move towards. If that happened we'd fall in the US News rankings! Look, if anything, blocking aWILDnight just perpetuates the idea that we, as ignorant kids, can't make wise choices on our own and need someone to come in and guide us along the way.
