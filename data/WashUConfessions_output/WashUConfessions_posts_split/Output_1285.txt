So, this is in reference to a confession that was posted this morning then subsequently deleted that argued that the current admin should post material that is more political, controversial, and offensive in nature because it really shows Wash U students for who they are.

Now, I gotta hand it to the admin that there is good reason to not make these posts. A lot of them just devolve into mud-slinging and a bunch of people jumping down someone's throat because the anon expressed an opinion that is pretty unpopular. These posts do go on to divide the community in a lot of ways

Also, though this isn't really about those posts, I think that the admin has a good handle on posts regarding mental health and the like. Those are very touchy, especially for people like me who have dealt with those issues. While we want for people to be able to talk about those things, an anonymous page isn't really a great place to do that...

But back to the point. I think the admin has some great reasons for his course of action, I really do. But I think also that the anon post from earlier touched on something important (though s/he admittedly didn't say this explicitly). There needs to be a place where people can express unpopular political opinions without fear of backlash toward themselves. Of course, I've heard all the arguments of "Well they only need to express them anonymously because they're too cowardly to express them otherwise."

Perhaps this is true, but judging from many of the responses I've seen on Confessions and YikYak and other anonymous sources, I'd say people have good reason to hesitate before voicing an opinion that goes against the mainstream here--they get attacked for it. In a way, anonymous social media is a necessity for a lot of people to speak up without fear of becoming ostracized, and refusing to post these on the basis that they result in a bunch of fighting essentially amounts toward censorship of a targeted group. True, the opposite side gets censored as well, but considering it quashes any real attempts at conversation from opposing views in the non-anon world, this doesn't really affect them all that much.

Also, and this is entirely just my opinion, I don't think these posts are necessarily causing divisions--rather, they're just exposing divisions that already exist. It's easy to act like the whole campus is unified when we act as though everyone's already of the same opinion. As soon as someone voices a differing opinion, though, all the faults lines are revealed, not created. But if anyone has any real intention of overcoming these divisions, then should we not know from where they come?

If I had to suggest a solution, I'd say make separate page for it. But that's just me. I'm sure someone can find some purported argumentative flaw in my logic, but that's my two cents
