I honestly think greek life is the worst part of this school. While I'm sure it's a great way for some people to make lifelong friends, I find it to be extremely divisive on campus. I'm a sophomore who rushed a couple times and just didn't find a group of guys I genuinely fit in with or wanted to spend the rest of college with. I thought not being a part of greek life wouldn't be a big deal but it's been detrimental to my social life. Whenever I want to hang out with people on the weekends they can't because they have "mixers" or "date parties." Going out isn't fun anymore because all the bars and frat parties are overrun by fraternities and sororities who all know each other and only want to mingle with themselves. I want to establish a group of friends to spend time with but even in the clubs and organizations I'm involved in everyone seems to prioritize their sorority or fraternity friends over everything else.
