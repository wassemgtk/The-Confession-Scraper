I've recently realized I lack a true personality of my own. I take whichever person I feel closest to and start to become more like them. It isn't a conscious idealization, more like I am absorbing part of who they are into myself so that I can seem to have a personality. I didn't realize this was even happening until it became a problem. I was thinking about converting to another religion for the 3rd time (not just interdenominational conversions, like Islam to Christianity conversions). I had no idea how the idea to become a casual catholic  popped into my head until I realized 2 of my closest friends identified that way. This realization honestly scares me because I feel like a whiteboard that other people keep writing on, and eventually I'll run out of space while having written nothing myself. Does this happen to other people? Are there some of you out there who also don't know who you are?
