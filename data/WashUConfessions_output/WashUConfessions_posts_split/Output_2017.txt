The other day, a Bosnian man, one of my people, was brutally murdered by teenagers with hammers.  But I got no emails from the administration, or my RA, and there were no protests on campus.  Apparently its acceptable when my community is attacked.  Where's the solidarity for us?  What happened to #alllivesmatter?
