I've never been one to believe in love at first sight or anything like that. Until last year that is. At the end of last year I met this girl randomly at one of my friends' parties in his dorm room. I had never seen her before and the moment she walked in the door I was overwhelmed with her beauty. After a couple minutes of trying my hardest not to stare at her, I decided that I had to talk to her (a couple cups of liquid courage helped). Now normally I'm pretty good with talking to women, but that was not the case that night. I stumbled over words and frantically tried to find good questions to ask to keep the conversation going. Anything to keep the conversation going. But every time I thought of something, I would look into her eyes and the brain that got me into WashU would be reduced to a that of a puppy's when its owner comes back home. Eventually I was forced to play a game of beer pong and when I came back she'd already made her leave. The next day I tried to talk to her over FB to no avail.

I only see her in passing every once in a while since then, but whenever I do it makes my day as I awkwardly make eye contact and then proceeded to shyly smile at my shoes. Again, I'm not a shy person, but she takes my breath away, makes my heart race and every other lovey-dovey clich√© I thought was foolish until now. And her worse offense? She's invaded my thoughts! She annexed my brain like Vladmir Putin and took no prisoners. She's a love war criminal and she doesn't even know it! Not that I'm mad or anything; quite the opposite actually. The meer thought of her cheers me up. I don't understand how this happened, and I don't know how this turned out to be such a  long confession. I just feel like I wanna tell this to the world and simultaneously keep this a secret ...so I did. Oh yeah she has a boyfriend btw. I guess my confession is that I'm scared that I'll never find someone who makes me feel this way again. And if I dont, will I feel like I settled for 2nd best and always think of the one that got away? Or maybe it's the one that was never in the lake in the first place? Idk. All I know is that I'm willing to wait until the cubs win the world series for this girl. If you read all of this then you the real MVP.

P.S. I posted this on Confessions out of respect for her boyfrien
P.P.S I'm not weird or a stalker or anything; I'm just a normal guy.
