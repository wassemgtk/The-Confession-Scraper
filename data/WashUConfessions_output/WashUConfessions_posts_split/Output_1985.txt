When I started school I felt really strange being away from my parents. It wasn't because I was sad to be away from them but also happy to finally have some space to reflect on my life so far. And it is now that I'm finally ready to admit that my parents physically abused me as a child. They stopped when I was 13 and since then pretended it never even happened, but only now am I beginning to really feel the pain of what happened. I am so ashamed and I don't feel like I can talk to anyone about this because I'm afraid they'll judge me and my parents. I still love them but am struggling to come to terms with how horribly they treated me when I was younger. I feel like this is weird and if I tell anyone they'll think less of me if I decide not to disown my parents or still have a close relationship with them. I don't know what to do, I feel like I have so many emotions that I have no release for and often find myself crying for no reason. Does anyone have any suggestions?
