To be completely honest, going to this school has made me feel really smart. I'm doing a rigorous double major, and the higher level "harder" classes have just been more doable for me. Classes are fun; they take work, but they always end up being rewarding in the end if you commit yourself.

So to people who are struggling: it's either because you don't have the right mindset, or because you aren't smart enough. Which do you think it is? You only have control over one of those things.

Frankly, stupid people end up successful all the time (we've all seen it). Don't focus on your capabilities, focus on your mindset. The world is a tough competitive place, and you can't afford the luxury of worry. Work hard, work smart, and do the best you can: then you have nothing to apologize for.
