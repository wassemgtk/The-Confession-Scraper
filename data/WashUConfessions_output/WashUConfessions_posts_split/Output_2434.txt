e the post yesterday that began by explaining that I was previously a Wash U students, I'm an Alum and now teach here. I was critical of a variety of ways that the university operates, particularly with respect to financial matters.

My post was up and when I saw it there were 74 likes and around 7 comments (on Friday). Later that night I looked for it again and it had disappeared. I suppose I should have made a copy of what I'd written because I no longer have it.

Can you ressurrect my post? I hope you can understand why I'm not sending you a PM. If that post was identified as having been written by me, I would face sanctions from the university and very likely lose my job altogether."

Anonymous poster,

Your post (#1299) is still up here: https://www.facebook.com/WashUConfessions/posts/952301184796697

Facebook shows the most recent statuses first, so it was just bumped down the page a bit after more confessions went through.  

I really do appreciate that you spoke up about these problems. I completely understand why you didn't send me a private message.  As a side note, I really appreciate the general level of trust that's been given to me and rest assured, these confessions are completely anonymous and will not be censored or edited. 

I have not yet received any complaints from the University, but even if I did, I would not let them censor the thoughts of the community or break anonymity.
