Hi there, so I'm that one white girl in the show (second year running now), and first of all, thank you for commenting--dialogue is exactly what the show is looking for. I think your reaction is in some ways understandable; I personally felt a little uncomfortable at times in preparation for the show. However, I think we have to remember that the show was not performed to target a particular sector of the audience and make them feel either good or bad, insult or uplift them. Instead, it was performed to represent a real, felt experience of black students on this campus; it was performed to make the entire audience think; and it was performed to bear witness to an incredible amount of pain that is part of that experience, especially this year. It wasn't intended to make us feel united--quite the opposite in fact--it was intended to make us reconsider and question just what our definition of "united" is today. And as for alienation, it's not always such a bad thing. I've felt it to an extent, and what it does is allow me to see exactly where I stand--and then decide where I want to stand.
