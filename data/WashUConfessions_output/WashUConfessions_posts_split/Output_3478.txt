Wash U Confessions is not perfect. However, it can make you more sensitive to other peoples' problems. For example, I now will no longer complain about getting a B on an exam, will make an effort to be friendly to people who look like they are having a rough time, and will work to complain less about my workload. Thank you Wash U Confessions for heightened awareness and understanding!
