Most days, I really don't feel like I belong here.

I find myself getting cranky and angry when I hear about people going on vacation, or being able to go shopping whenever they want, or going out to fancy, expensive dinners. I come from a family that has always struggled with money and has never had the luxury to do so many of the things students here have done. I hate that 18 year olds who have never worked a day in their life get to go on extravagant European vacations when my 70 year old grandma, who is working so hard to the point where there are medical problems, has never even stepped foot outside the country.

I understand that privilege is not something people ask for, and if my parents could afford to send me on a vacation, I of course would take it. Despite that, I still am disgusted whenever I hear about anyone going on vacation. I hate when I hear that people "bought" something expensive, when I know that none of the money they bought it with was their own-- it was their parents, or inherited. How is it fair that I've had a job since I was 16, working 30 hours a week, while having to match the academic rigor of my peers who didn't have to be burdened with a job?

My frustration has become so bad it has affected my friendships and my overall happiness. When I'm at home with peers who understand the woes of paying bills and having to budget their money that they earned, I feel like I belong. I realize how lucky I am to have a loving family who has supported me in all my endeavors, even though we are not financially stable. But when I'm here, I feel subpar, unequal, and a terrible longing for the privileges others have.
