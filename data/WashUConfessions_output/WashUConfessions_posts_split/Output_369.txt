As an alum I confess that despite graduating with an Undergraduate and Masters degree from WashU and two years later being back home in rural United States, working for $16/hr manufacturing and setting head stones (yes, I make and put fancy rocks on dead people), side hustling as a farmhand during harvest (I'm sitting in a tractor at 10:30 pm on a Friday night unloading corn as I type this), I've never been happier and more satisfied with my life.

I'm close to family and I'm married to an amazing woman whom I never would've met if it wasn't for my $105,000 student loan debt (a small price to pay).

Sometimes, I wonder how my life would've been different if all of my grandiose plans during my school years came to fruition. Somehow I don't think I would be nearly as satisfied as I am now.

Moral of the story: Don't stress. Even if you don't get the GPA you wanted, the job you wanted, the grad school you wanted, you still can be happy! Happier than you ever imagined!

TL:DR: Even if things don't work out how you had planned, you can still be happy!
