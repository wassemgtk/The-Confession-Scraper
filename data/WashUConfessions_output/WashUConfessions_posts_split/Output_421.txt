Today, I walked to school with a friend who lives close to me. The entire time, they had headphones in their ears and whenever I tried to make conversation, they would obviously not be paying attention and I would have to repeat whatever I was saying. It's incredibly rude and frustrating to be so blatantly disrespected. If you are with someone socially, take out your headphones and talk to them or don't put yourself in that social situation.
