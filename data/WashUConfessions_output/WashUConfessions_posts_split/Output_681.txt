Current senior here, and disappointed at the fact that I haven't had a serious relationship in college. I feel like it's too late now, but I'm not interested in casual hook-ups. I know that you don't have to be in a relationship to be happy, but I am tired of being alone when so many of my friends are in happy relationships.
