"It's not that hard to walk your bike," says the chick shortly after I pass her on the hill to campus right after the overpass. 

Seeing as I'm about to have surgery in 3 hours on my foot, yes, it is that hard to walk my bike. Arbitrary pretentious judgment like this is my least favorite thing about this campus (not that it doesn't happen off campus as well, it's just exceptionally bad here). I'm tired of people assuming that the behaviors of others automatically prove their poor character. 

If you feel the need to judge everyone around you as flawed, it's probably psychological projection. Nobody's perfect and most people act with good intentions most of the time. Stop looking for reasons to complain and enjoy the fucking perfect weather before it's 10 degrees for 40 days straight.
