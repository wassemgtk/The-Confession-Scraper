It pisses me off beyond belief when I say, "I was up late last night" and then somebody says, "Oh, that's not that late." If you're one of those people, fuck you. Some people need more sleep than others. Wash U is already competitive enough; I'm not competing with you on how long I can keep my freaking eyelids open. Love ya all, but stop that shit.
