I also hate living in the Lofts. They're a huge "fuck you" to the U City community and the students. I hate the fact that I'm living in a glitzy building while there are people panhandling outside my window. It's not that I hate the panhandling; I'd just rather live in something more modest while others out there are suffering.

I was essentially forced into the Lofts, because I planned on going abroad. This meant I had to live in ResLife housing, because no one except Quadrangle is going to give you a 6 month lease (and there were no apartments left by the time I looked). Come time for housing selection, I had a shit lottery number, and ended up with the most expensive housing option: the Lofts.

I'm not going to donate a dime to this school. Instead, I'm going to donate to organizations that help the people outside my window.
