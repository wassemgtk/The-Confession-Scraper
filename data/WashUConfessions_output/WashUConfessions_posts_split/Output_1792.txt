To confession 2023: I feel you. I never thought I'd say this, but I dreaded friday nights more than anything last semester.. Friday nights are when I realize I'm more lonely than ever. Friday nights are when I want to socialize, be with people, and have fun, but only to realize I have no one but myself and that all my "friends" are busy with something/someone else. Friday nights are when I can no longer use studying as an excuse to avoid my loneliness...  and as an extrovert, I can't imagine going through a semester like that again... I'm officially scared of Friday nights at WashU. Scared of being alone.

And the funny thing is, so many people feel this way at WashU.. yet how come we can't find each other? Maybe it's that we're scared to reveal ourselves, scared of being vulnerable. It makes sense, because that's exactly what I'm doing, hiding under the mask of anonymity.

I wish it will get better... but I don't know how telling myself these empty words over and over again will help anymore.
