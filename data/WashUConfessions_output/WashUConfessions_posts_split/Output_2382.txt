I feel like as a member of greek life  it's even easier to be generalized and stereotyped based on the fact that you're in it at all than in regards to your particular chapter or frat. It's the rudest thing when people who aren't even involved in Greek Life say things like "that's not even a cool sorority" or "that frat's lame" as if they can't believe anyone would take pride in being in it due to it not reaching "top" standards. As someone who is involved in Greek Life, I feel like 75% (at least) of members recognize that there's more to it than just "being the best," it's about finding a community of people whom you can identify with and having a blast with them. For someone who is a complete outsider to Greek life and especially the rush process to make such a vapid generalization demeans the whole thing.
