I think I was raped. I told him no but I had done other things with him and was pressured into it. It's kind of a blur...I don't think most of my friends will understand and the ones who do just want me to do something about it. I know I can talk to SARAH and other resources on campus, but I still have to go around for the majority of the day pretending everything is fine and being my usual happy, bubbly self. I have to pretend I'm fine with the rest of the world watching even though I'm crumbling.
