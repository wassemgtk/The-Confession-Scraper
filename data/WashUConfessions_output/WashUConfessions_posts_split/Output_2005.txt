I'm a junior in engineering, and it seems like the longer I stay in engineering school here, the more I find out about how dumb I am compared to the other kids. I went into this semester really intent on doing well, so I reduced the number of classes I took and studied hard - I didn't spend a single weekend away from the library(both Saturdays and Sundays), went to all of my classes, never fell asleep, went to office hours and help sessions, took detailed notes, prepared for exams a week ahead, and even gave up on all my other activities to leave time for studies- but the grades turned out mediocre, again. Then I look at the next guy who studies for a day and scores better on me on exams. Are other students really trying as hard as me, or am I just plain stupid? I miss being one of the smart kids.
