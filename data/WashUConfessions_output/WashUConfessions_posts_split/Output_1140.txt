Second semester senior here. I've had so many people thinking that I'm hypocritical or at least overreacting - including professors - because I still care about my grades for this semester even when I've already secured an offer. I consider grades to be reflections of my quality of the work over the semester - and because I've worked pretty hard I would like to see results. Is that insane?
