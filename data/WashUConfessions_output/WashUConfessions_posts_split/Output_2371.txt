I confess that as an Asian, I have got 13 not-A-range grades over my past three years at Wash U, including a C, in a class that is very much related to my major, and a D+ and a F, both in my major. I ended up retaking all three classes, and I still got a B- after retaking that D+ class, although the other two turned out fine.

All of these shit happened in my first 3 semesters here and since then I had worked super hard and finally got my GPA back to a reasonable range and am eligible for honor societies, Dean's List and honor thesis. I tried my best to make it up by TAing for  two of the three classes I've screwed up.

However, as I am applying to grad schools, I am really freaking out. PhD programs are more competitive than I have ever imagined. Top schools receive almost 200 applications per year and they admit like 3 students. I have been pre-grad for the past 10 years (no kidding) and have been doing researches since Freshman year. I really want to be in a top program and I am willing to work hard, take a gap year, whatever to get there. Yet I am afraid that my first three semesters have done irreversible damage to my future. Although everyone assures me that no one really cares about the first semesters but what if every applicant has a crazy high GPA and they just throw my application out without looking at anything else?
