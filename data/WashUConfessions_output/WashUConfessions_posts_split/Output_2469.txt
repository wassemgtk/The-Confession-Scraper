Hi,

My name is (xxxx), I'm African - American, Female. I grew up in neighborhoods ( we moved a lot, being poor and shit) that most people avoided when they had the means to. I went to straight up dangerous schools until I tested into better ones outside of my school zone. I don't speak ebonics, or wear hoop earrings and tims so you probably didn't realize I was here. But I am. Whats good.
