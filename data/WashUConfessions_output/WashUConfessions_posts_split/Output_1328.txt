Hey admin, if I make a confession will you also include a general question I have about class registration? I'll be forever grateful.

Here goes: Over spring break I broke up with my girlfriend since high school because I finally accepted that I'm gay. She thought I was making it up as an excuse and freaked out and told everyone from our school, and basically dragged my name through the mud, also outing me in the process. But I've put that bitch behind me and am now having a great time hooking up with dudes. Holla at me on Grindr, fellas.

And a question: I need an easy math/science class for requirements and was wondering if anyone could recommend anything. How's Intro to Human Evolution? Something that has no attendance policy would be ideal.
