I think it's bullshit that the IM student referees get paid peanuts for working. They get next to no training, and about half of them don't even know half the rules to the game they referee. Double their pay, give them some decent training, and IM sports will become more fun and a substantial number of needless injuries will cease to happen. The university spends over a million dollars a year on god damned flowers, can we not dedicate a minuscule fraction of the budget to IM sports?
