I confess: I am a girl and I think the whole "micro-aggression" thing is incredibly stupid. It makes me ashamed to be a woman in this generation and I'm really tired of all the girls my age complaining about how "sexist" our society is. There are countries in the world where women have little or no legal rights, where women are beaten and assaulted every day, where a woman can be put to death for the "crime" of being raped, and you think the epitome of sexism is someone assuming you like the color pink? Or a man opening a door for you? Seriously? Grow up. (Oh man I'm going to get so much hate for this!)
