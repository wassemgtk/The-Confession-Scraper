As I near the end of my freshman year, I'm considering transferring elsewhere. I have a lot of reasons, but I keep telling myself that I belong here even though I often feel alone (not an uncommon feeling for many students, as I understand).

My boyfriend goes to school in a different state, and we've been together 3 years. We thought it wouldn't be so bad, since we've been apart before, but he's my best friend, and I have so few good friends here. I know that if I were to transfer, I would have a solid friend base--I've met and talk regularly with a bunch of his friends at his school, and they have activities I would participate in that WashU can't offer me. My boyfriend succeeds there academically whereas I often have trouble keeping my head above water, and I attribute that partly to my unhappiness with my friends. I miss out on so many events and stuff that I would otherwise go to due to the fact that I have trouble finding people I click with.

But I also don't want to uproot what I do have here. It's a lot of work to transfer and reestablish everything I've built here at a new place, and it's not like WashU is miserable or anything. I have a few friends with whom I'm close and who are dear to me, some professors I have come to know and value, and a lot of other perks about WashU that I enjoy (the little stuff, you know). I also worry about what my parents would think--they've never particularly supported my relationship (but they haven't dissented either), and they've always stressed the importance of academics above significant others. They're paying for my entire education. I know they want me to be happy, but I worry that they'll think I'm trying to transfer for something as "superficial" as being with him, when it's really a lot more than that. It's academics, a social life of my own, extracurriculars, and general well-being. Not to mention that he is my closest and most important friend in my life. I'm just afraid that if I stay here, my unhappiness is just going to grow into a monster. I never seriously entertained the idea of transferring until tonight.

I don't want to admit to myself that I made a mistake in coming to WashU, and I don't want it to be a mistake--this is such a nice school, my major is wonderful, and there really aren't problems with WashU. I want to stay. But I also want to be happy, and I haven't felt happy for almost an entire semester.
