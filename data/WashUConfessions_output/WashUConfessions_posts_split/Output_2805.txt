I've been having casual sex with someone. As a guy, society would think "Wow, what a lucky dude!" but that isn't the case. It breaks my heart that I'm not together with this girl because she doesn't believe she's capable of love. So I'm constantly paranoid she'll have sex with some other guy, pointing to the fact that we aren't "technically dating". We're not, I know. I've had the chance to hook up with other girls but it just doesn't feel right to me. She's the only one in my mind.
And so, even though I don't want to, I try my best in bed to keep her. Sex isn't for pleasure anymore, it's a bargaining chip... The worse the sex is, the higher chance for her to leave me for another guy.

How did my life get like this, and how do I fix it?
