Sometimes I really wish there were a WashU dating website. Nothing sketchy or Tinder-y, just a real site where people who are genuinely looking for someone special could go and meet other students. It's too bad that dating sites get such a bad rep with our generation - I think that, especially on a college campus, it can be hard to meet the kind of people you want to date. Even if you're super involved and/or go out and meet people, there still might be someone nearby who could be a great match for you but who you just never run into for one reason or another. Maybe I'm just a hopeless romantic, but I always think about how that special someone could be right here on this campus, but we may never come across them! Now I feel a little lame after typing this out...I wonder if other people at this school want committed relationships over random hookups as much as I do.

In any case, I think it'd be pretty cool if someone with computer skills (ie definitely not me) started up a WashU dating page. What's one more WashU-related social media page?
