I know the Qur'an is just a book.  I know that there are many interpretations of that book.  I know that the Bible has been used to justify crimes of similar or higher calibre.  And it feels shameful to admit this, which is why i'm saying it on Wash U Confessions, but as a Jew I honestly feel a tiny bit scared when someone mentions they're a Muslim.  Maybe its just because of the media, just because most of the violence happening in today's world is centered around the Muslim faith.  And maybe that's just it.  The Inquisition was 500 years ago.  The Crusades happened longer before then.  But today the leader of the Catholic world seems to me to be somewhat of a reformist.  Maybe I haven't looked in the right places, but I don't see that type of leader in Islam and that continues to make me scared.  Especially when its a religion that refuses to allow others to poke fun at it because any religion that takes itself too seriously in the 21st Century has a problem.  I feel ashamed of these views but I can't stop having them and I can't stop treading lightly around those who proclaim the Muslim faith.
