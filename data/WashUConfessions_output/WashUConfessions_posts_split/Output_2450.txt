Sometimes I feel like there's a subtle bias against higher socioeconomic people, like the post that said black students shouldn't raise their voices about stuff if they're not from poor towns/neighborhoods. My family's pretty well off, my dad grew up lower-middle class but got a degree and worked hard to be successful. I'm aware of and thankful for the major advantages I've had because of that but I feel too often people assume that if you're not on financial aid you were born with a "silver spoon" and everything's been easy. Economic advancement shouldn't be stigmatized.
