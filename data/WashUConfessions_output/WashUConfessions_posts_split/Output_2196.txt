I just got a hug from my professor, and it was one of the kindest gestures I've received from a professor. I had spent the past hour crying in his office (because of life stress, not his class), and he tried to give me advice and encouragement as best he could. Before he had to leave, he asked if there was anything more I wanted to ask, and I asked if I could have a hug. He hugged me and said everything was going to be ok. I joked that I would have asked sooner, but I didn't think professors were allowed to hug students. He said he didn't think they were, but he'd make an exception for the circumstances. I get that those kind of rules exist for a reason, but I'm glad there are those who will bend the rules when someone is in need. And I'm really touched that a professor would take so much time to make sure I'm ok even though I'm just one of many students who's taken his class.
