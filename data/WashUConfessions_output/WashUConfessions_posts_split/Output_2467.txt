The incredibly offensive confession #1341 makes me ashamed as a WashU alum and concerned about the WashU community. I graduated from WashU with African Americans that were the first to achieve a college degree. Some even grew up in Ferguson and East St Louis. But let's pretend for a moment that the writer of confession #1341's premise that all black people at WashU are privileged is correct... Why should the college educated, "privileged" black people that have "never experienced racism" not fight for the downtrodden? Is it not all of our duty to society to fight for what's right, regardless of race? Regardless of class? It appears that blacks have a double edged sword against them: if you're black, poor, and left victim to police brutality, society says you are claiming false racism. And if you are bettering your reality, studying as a student at WashU, you are too privileged and too rich to fight against racism. So what are blacks to do?
