Ok so I guess this is more of a question than it is a confession, but I'd really really like to know, so maybe somebody can help?

This past semester I secretly wanted to rush a sorority very badly. But I'm here on a financial aid scholarship, and I'm not sure that my family could handle the burden of having to pay dues. I also don't know many people who have money troubles like I do, and often feel embarrassed when I can't afford to do the things that my friends can, so I just told people who asked that I didn't want to join greek life after all.

...But that's a lie. I really really do. Is there such a thing as scholarships for sorority sisters who can't afford to pay dues? I've never heard of anybody mention it before, but it would be nice to know. If there isn't, I can move on, but if there is, I could rush this year!
