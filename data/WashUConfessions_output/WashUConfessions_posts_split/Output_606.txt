I'm a girl and I made a wrong turn into the men's restroom in McDonnell yesterday. It's dark in that part of the 1st floor and the women's restroom is on the left side in nearly every other place on campus, so I'm actually kind of curious as to whether this has happened to anyone else.. (... Also, are all urinals on campus so large? Are urinals in general that size??)
