For everyone doubting confession 2265, this is definitely legitimate. The same thing happened to me. I was on the exec board for a cultural group. I did more work than just about anyone on exec. But I didn't fit in with the rest of the board. Even though I had been elected by the entire club, who  knew I was dedicated to the group, the exec found a way to kick me off simply because I did not fit in with them perfectly. I understand that there needs to be accountability in student groups, and sometimes exec members do need to be kicked off. But to do so because someone isn't your favorite person, rather than because of their work ethic, is simply wrong. Yes this happens in the real world. I'm glad I'm prepared for it. But WashU certainly should be better. And to those who make WashU a cliquey, gossipy place that is unaccepting of different personalities, shame on you.
