Let me confess something: I'm amusical. I don't understand music, and I've listened to lots of it. Rock, jazz, hip-hop, techno/EDM, modern classical, Romantic/Baroque, Renaissance music, folk, world. It all sounds basically the same to me: loud, discordant, unpleasant clanging. I'd get the same out of crashing plates. 

When I was about 12, I hated the fact that I was amusical. I tried denying it to myself. I tried exercises to help my pitch discrimination and rhythm. I bought dozens of albums in different genres and listened to them over and over. I took piano lessons for eighteen months (but didn't get much beyond "Mary Had a Little Lamb"). Eventually I just accepted it: I have no sense of music. So what? I can read. I can enjoy visual art. I can hike and bicycle. I can watch sports. I can enjoy lots of things in the world, just not music. Yes, that one source of pleasure is closed off to me...but I've accepted that.

Let me confess something else: I'm a straight guy and I'm terrible with women. I'm a sophomore (20) and a virgin. And in my late adolescence, I tried everything. I bought all the books on attracting women I could. I hit the gym. I spent hundreds on nice clothes and dating apps. I got dozens of numbers, asked lots of girls to lunch. Nothing. So I'm trying to accept, just like I did with music, that I will not be sexually satisfied in the foreseeable future. As with music, one source of pleasure is closed off to me. And yet...with music, I could accept it, that I'll never enjoy music. But it's so much harder for me to accept that I'll spend my youth without the sexual pleasure I want so much. I know it's true, but I still feel like if I just asked this one girl out, just went to the gym one more time, just cut this one snack food from my diet...

To me, it is deeply sad that our culture does not recognize virgin-shaming as a serious problem. I think it would be easier for me if it weren't for the fact that my virginity humiliates me so much. "Neckbeard" and "virgin" and "incel" are constant terms of abuse. There is article after article about slut-shaming, but almost nothing about virgin-shaming. Anyone who tries to recognize this as a real problem has to couch it in all kinds of disclaimers, like "Of course I'm not saying women owe me sex..." And of course they don't. I'm not saying women owe me sex; I am saying that there should be more support for men like me to accept that they will not have sex. It's not about changing what I have, it's about accepting what I have. It's about getting the mental strength to accept –– as with my amusicality –– the cards life dealt me...and living happily and with dignity anyway.
