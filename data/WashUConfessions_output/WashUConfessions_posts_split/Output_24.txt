I have dental phobia. I've scheduled an appointment with a dentist three times already and cancelled every time. It's never been a problem until now though, because my wisdom teeth are coming in, and it's causing a lot of pain and swelling. I don't have any family near here to take me to the dentist to get them removed, I don't know any dentists around here that I trust, and I'm a loner, so I don't really have friends either. It's just really scary.
