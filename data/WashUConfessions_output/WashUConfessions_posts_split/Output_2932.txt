I've been dealing with depression for 6 years and counting. It took me a very long time to acknowledge my depression and even longer to find a way to deal with it on my own. I've been hiding behind a fake smile and cheerful personality so no one would even believe that I was depressed. I want to get medical help but I'm scared because I don't want medication to force me to be happy. I don't know how long I can take it though. I feel really happy and cheerful some days but sometimes my depression gets so bad that I literally cannot have a conversation without crying. My depression has affected the relationships with my friends deeply.
