I'm sick of WashU's empty, reactive activism when it comes to the racial issues in the area. No one talks or cares about these things until it becomes trendy to hold signs and yell about something you don't really know shit about. Otherwise the majority of students are content to think about the black half of our city only in the stupid cliche that they all tell each other--"Don't ever go north of Delmar!"--as if to display their street savvy and St. Louis knowledge. Stop that bullshit, it's not all a ghetto warzone where you'll be shot upon crossing Delmar. If you actually care DO something, don't just show up for a protest that accomplished... what, exactly? Maybe start by not treating a whole part of the city as something to be avoided and scared of.
