I went through a lot of shit in high school, just emotionally. I managed to figure some stuff out, and even though I know I’ve got a long way to go, I’m more in control now, and I’m determined to make these four years the best they can be for myself. Things haven’t been perfect so far, but that’s totally okay because I’m in a good place in life right now, and I’m happy with that. So is it so wrong that I just want to stay away from all the unnecessary (and often drunken) drama that constantly seems to be going on? Why does it matter who didn’t call who and what someone thought someone said about someone else? Because I’m so done with that.
