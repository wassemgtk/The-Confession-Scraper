I feel incredibly lonely here. I don't seem to fit in with any groups of friends that I've hung out with and I feel like an outsider to everyone. Everyone suggests to join campus groups but I've looked through them and I frankly feel like I wouldn't fit in. I don't really associate any of the ethnic groups, I can't sing, I'm not athletic, I'm not a business major or premed, etc. This was a huge problem for me in high school as well and I had very few close friends, never dated anyone, and never had a friend group that I really fit in with. I kept telling myself it would all be better in college but so far it's been a huge disappointment
