My R.A. last year asked me to come up things I loved about Wash U for a floor meeting/project. I couldn't think of any until now. It's been almost a year and I just want to say, thank you Wash U for opening up my mind. In high school, I would have been mortified if my friends were not heterosexual. Three years later, I'm following US vs Windsor and hoping they'll finally rule DOMA unconstitutional. I think I have finally stopped regretting my decision to come here.
