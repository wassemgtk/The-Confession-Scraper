God exists. Deal with it. (Not promoting any specific sort of theism, just theism in general.) I'm tired of the idea of God being scoffed at and spurned by my peers, especially in class discussion with sly comments that I hear endnotes though many of them are whispered. I may not be able to do it myself, but I know a few students here who are able to articulate why he exists well. Smart people can believe that God exists too.
