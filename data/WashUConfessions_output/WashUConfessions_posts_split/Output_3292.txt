Woke up with some sinus congestion, so I thought I would clear it up with a spicy carvery wrap. After ordering my wrap with fire sauce and jalapenos I waited as they rattled off everyoneâ€™s orders. When it came down to the last wrap I was the only person left, but this wrap was not what I ordered. I took this wrap anyways, but whoever ordered this had no idea what they were doing (blame it on the visitors that tour guides send to Holmes in the dozens). I hope whoever stole my lunch got what they deserved when they bit into my carvery fire bomb.
