I confess that after having dated couple people and going through all the heart-breaking shit and stuff, I've become so much light-hearted in being in a relationship now. Despite being a female, I don't hold back anxiously waiting for the guy to approach me first anymore, but rather make the first move and pursue whatever I want - which is really fun and exciting. However, there are times where I inevitably worry about seeming too desperate or even slutty because of my outspoken actions. I also worry that I might have convinced myself too well that no such thing as an "everlasting" love exists, thinking that even if this relationship doesn't work out, that's fine because there will be a next one eventually - which really affects the depth of the affection I share with the person I am currently in a relationship with. Maybe I'm just scared of being too committed and not getting the same response from the other person. I can't really decide what's right or wrong.
