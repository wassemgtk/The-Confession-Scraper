Amid the flow of recent confessions that have been discussing the tuition of WashU, and college tuition in general, I started to think more about how I got here. My father used to work at the medical school and retired a few years ago with all of his benefits. Namely, that all of his direct family members get 4 years of free tuition at WashU. I was accepted last spring with a pretty average (by WashU's standards) application. 32 ACT, 3.9 GPA with good course rigor, and solid extra curriculars.

My question is for all of the people bashing WashU for being a money-hoarding institution. Why would they accept me? My father had already retired so clearly it was not to please him. And I'm sure there were plenty of other applicants who were just as qualified as me, if not more so, that would have paid the whole $45,700 a year. Maybe there was something they saw in my application that I'm just not connecting, but I did a LOT of research during the college application process and I genuinely think there were plenty of other equally qualified applicants who would have paid the full tuition. I guess my question is why me? Obviously you can't answer that because you don't know me, but in general, why would they do something like this if WashU is solely a financially driven institution?
