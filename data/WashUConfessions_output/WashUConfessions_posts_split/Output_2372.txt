The Catholic Student Center sounds like such a great community and I'm very jealous as a Christian. As a junior, I've been to 3 different Christian fellowships on campus, and I didn't particularly feel welcomed by their communities... They were very nice, but it always felt superficial. They were either extremely exclusive (unintentionally) or not tight at all...  At this point, I kind of just gave up on finding a community of brothers and sisters with the same faith.. But since everyone is so friendly & helpful on WashU confessions, I thought I might as well try and ask: is there any Christian groups on campus that actual has a great community that will genuinely welcome new members?
