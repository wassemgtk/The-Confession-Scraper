I confess I love marijuana. I wish marijuana and cocaine were legal. There are so many worse things you could put in your body that are perfectly legal and yet I could go to jail for smoking a J. As muddy waters once said "there should be no law on people who wanna smoke a little dope". I probably care about marijuana legalization than any other current political issue. sorry not sorry.
