I just submitted a confession about being raped and I know you're trying to stay away from depressing posts but I just feel so lost and voiceless right now and I would really appreciate it if you could post that one because I've confessed things I can't say outloud yet. 

Thank you so much.

I confess that I'm consumed by a ridiculous amount of guilt . I feel guilty that I put myself in a position that allowed someone to take advantage of me. I feel guilty because I didn't scream or shout or try and end things sooner. I feel guilty because I didn't fight back. I feel guilty for all the shit I've put my friends and parents through because of it. I feel guilty that after all the love and support I was getting I still felt the need to reach out to someone who used to be important to me, but clearly doesnt want to be in my life or support system anymore. I feel guilty that I haven't healed "fast enough". 

I feel guilty that I was raped and there's absolutely nothing anyone can say to make me feel differently.
