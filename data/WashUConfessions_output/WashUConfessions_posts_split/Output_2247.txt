For me, "where are you from" is a question I feel both hard and uncomfortable to answer, both because I've lived in various places around the world and because I am still in the process of finding the one identity I see myself as the most. But this question is so inevitable, and almost every time when I try to intentionally skip it in self introduction people would continue to ask me, and saying that "I don't feel comfortable answering this" just sounds like a jerk. Not sure what to do now.
