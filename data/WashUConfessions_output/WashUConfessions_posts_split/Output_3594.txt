I actually love WashU. I also love St. Louis. I'm happier here than I've been in years and although the city isn't exactly regarded as the gem of American society, I appreciate the opportunity it gives me to make a real impact in the community here and really help people. I'm from a pretty nice town and got into my fair share of pretty good schools, but I'm so happy with my decision to come here instead. I love the people, the professors, and I even think administration here does a pretty good job of taking care of us. I mean hell, our dining hall is open until 3am and we have TempurPedic mattresses, amazing people whose job it is to basically be friends to the freshmen, and pretty much any academic opportunity and resource we could reasonably want. So to anybody else out there who feels like they're the only one who loves WashU (and I hope to God you ARE out there)... you're not.
