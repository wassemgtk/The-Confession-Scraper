Last Sunday when I was scraping the food and napkins on my plate into the landfill bin at Bear's Den, I heard a girlâ€˜s voice at my back:"You could have composted that, you know?" I didn't realize that she's talking to me until she walked passed me to her friend and the guy said "Can you stop just talking to ppl like that..." Then the girl interrupted "Why not,wtf, I can, and I care." while she's dumping her something into "recycle". Dumbfounded and a little bit ashamed, I said nothing and left. As an international student, I don't want to be perceived as rude or lacking common sense of environmental-friendly acts. Also I didn't figure out a defense for myself enough quickly. On my way out of Bear's Den I pondered about the situation and started to feel a lil bit angry and ridiculous about the girl. If you were really caring about environmental issues instead of merely speaking from a high horse, you should have at least looked at me and told me what I did wrong in a complete sentence and a normal tone. That's what might really work for someone to change for the positive; accusing someone from the back with something she's not fully aware of would not.
