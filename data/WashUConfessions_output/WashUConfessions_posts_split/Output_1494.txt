Response to Confession 2320: As a guy I don't mind if you watch me working out. I do wonder what the response to this confession would be if the genders were reversed though. Is it bad for a guy to stare at a girl in the gym if he's not creepy or rude about it? Honestly wondering what the opinion is on this.
