Today I saw that cheese-ology announced they're closing on March 7. I used to work for them, and I'm so deeply disappointed by this news. Chef Bill is one of the most socially-conscious employers I've had, offering fair wages and going to great lengths to avoid cutting hours for myself and about a dozen amazing former coworkers, several of whom have families to support. Cheese-ology has also done a number of benefit nights for student groups here on campus, generously giving back to our community. I know there's been a lot of discussion on here as of late regarding tipping and the reputation of WashU students on the loop. If you want to make a genuine difference and give back to a local small business, stop by Cheese-ology before they close. Be polite, tip well, etc etc - but mostly let the staff know they've been appreciated. It's heartbreaking to see a company that has worked so hard to give so much to other people have to close, but I hope they go out with a bang.
