I get paranoid really easily, and maybe I'm just insecure,  but I've always been suspicious of one of my gf's guy friends. I believed her when she said nothing happened, but every time his name pops up or she gets a text from him, her attitude changes and she gets anxious, like in a bad way. And every time I ask what's wrong she says it's nothing, but it keeps happening. I just get the feeling she's hiding something that somehow affects our relationship now, even though it probably happened in the past or she no longer has control over it. Maybe I'm just imagining all the worst case scenarios, but I just wish she'd tell me. I know I don't have any right or anything to know, but I'm having a hard time trusting her right now, and I want to change that, and I want to be there for her.
