I'm honestly pretty sick and tired of the way that sororities are run. I would have no issue with the idea of sororities, but they create cliques and exclude others while trying to sell an image based on a "sisterhood" that is actually surrounded by exclusivity, and tries to market that to others and make others feel like they want to be a part solely because they would otherwise feel excluded.
