I'm intimidated by the WashU feminist Facebook group sometimes. I enjoy reading what people post. I really appreciate how a lot of current events relevant to my interests - legislation regarding LGBT rights, or Planned Parenthood, or Polish towns banning Winnie the Pooh for being inappropriate for children - are posted to the page, and I appreciate the occasional article that teaches me something new (for instance, that there are towns out there that for some crazy reason feel that Winnie the Pooh's lack of pants results in a problematic gender identity).

But whenever I want to post something to the page, I get really nervous.  There's been instances when someone makes an irreverent comment, and they get immediately jumped on for being insensitive. Or someone asks "what does this even have to do with feminism?" in a pretty rude way.

Heck, there's been like forty articles posted where I really want to say "I can't believe it's not Onion" and I'm too nervous to bust out that line because I'm worried someone will find it hurtful somehow.  It sometimes feels like you can't play in the game unless you know all the rules.

I still love the FB group as an educational tool. I just wish I was more comfortable participating.
