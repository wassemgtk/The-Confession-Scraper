People always say "money doesn't make people happy" but so many of my friends here always make me feel guilty about coming from such a privileged background. I say this phrase resonates with me because I'm severely depressed. And yet I'm coming to WashU with no financial stress and I can pretty much buy myself whatever i need; food clothes, entertainment. But I'm not happy. I'm unhappy almost all of the time; I'm just lonely and sad.

And when I can't motivate to do work and talk about trying for lesser pay jobs they scoff at the idea that I'll be able to get by or that pursuing something I love is better than busting my back in classes I hate. I just want my message to get across I guess. Don't waste your time on things you don't enjoy for the sake of them. Do what you love and what inspires you. Yeah you can't compare people who are poor and people who are depressed, but no matter what you'll get through life. Just pick a way to go through it that makes you happy and don't judge someone else for what they have.
