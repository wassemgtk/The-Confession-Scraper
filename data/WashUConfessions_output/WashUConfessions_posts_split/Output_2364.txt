I came to WashU over an Ivy because I received a very generous scholarship, but more importantly, the people I met seemed to be more genuine and caring, the campus was beautiful, and I figured that the academics, while rigorous, would not be as stressful. But now I'm a junior, and I'd be lying if I said that I didn't regret my choice. I've never been more dismal academically in my life since I came here. Each semester, I tried to start on a clean slate and tried to study really hard for exams and start papers earlier so I wasn't scrambling last minute. But even when I did that, I never got good results, which leads me to not start earlier for other assignments and exams as well. I got out of a midterm just yesterday that I know I failed, and it's been eating away at me and bringing back the stress that I always felt here. This is a class I need for my major so I can't drop it. That isn't all - I feel like I have only a fraction of the friends here than I did in high school. And most of my closer friends aren't people that I met here. Meeting people here seems to be a lot more fleeting, and other than my fraternity brothers who I love, I can't seem to get people to stick around in my life. I'm not trying to disparage anyone here - I honestly just wanted to get this all off my chest. I envy all those people who are so well-known and liked around campus, those people who can say hi to such a diverse group of people on a single walk down campus, those people who, on top of killing it socially, are getting on the Dean's list and amazing internships. I know WashU isn't inherently a bad school, but it seems like I personally can't fit in here. And that's why I keep wondering if I made the wrong choice when I was a measly 18 year old. But now I'm stuck here, too late to transfer, with a tarnished GPA, and have to ride it out. Certainly doesn't help that my dream career requires graduate school.
