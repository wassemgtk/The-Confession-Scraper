I'm having trouble writing this right now, because of a general sense of numbness throughout my body and slight trembling. I just had what I can describe as my first mental breakdown, and it was so horrifying, I can't believe I was capable of bottling up all of that emotion, which erupted rather horribly, where I had convulsions, laughing fits, mind-numbing screams in bouts of 15 minutes, and when I thought the agony subsided, it came back again, and I could no longer breath normally, and felt like I had to fight for air. I thought I had mental breakdowns before, but this was something else. Whenever I thought about my current laughable situation, the hurricane of jumbled up emotions just exacerbated. I have a slight pain in my chest even now and am hyperventilating. I feel like I re-enacted the horrible transformation of a super-villain, with the uncontrollable roars, groans, jumping and cackling, which ironically arose from pure desperation and pain, combined with the simultaneous crying and total loss of self control. All of my life passed through my eyes, and the bleakness of my current situation triggered another spoilt tantrum etc. etc.

Halfway through, I thought I was an undeserving loony, as I was doing everything I'd seen mentally ill people do in the media. I was like Dr. Jekyll turning into Mr. Hyde, and I welcomed the newly found derangement as the change that I had been longing. Observing my physical and mental reactions were interesting, and one time my breakdown was interrupted with me thinking about the power of the nervous system and human physiology and its capabilities. But I was overwhelmed with emotion again, when I realized my journey of knowledge to what I loved was fraught with insurmountable odds, and I thought how unfair that was, and continued to bawl like a baby.

I thought, if I'm having breakdowns like this, because of a fear for the future, stress, constant feeling of inferiority, under-performing in classes, and missed deadlines, kudos to everyone who goes through much worse and manages just well, still perseveres and lives on. I thought I was strong, but I wish I had the strength of those people and I hope the best for them. I don't think anyone should go through the suffering some people experience. I've stated this before, but this was really mind-boggling, as if someone was torturing me physically as well. And when I thought about how many years, I had to live still, and how many more agonies I had to bear, I wished I had a heart-attack and curled up and died right then and there. I can't imagine how the unfortunate people of history endured what they did. And I do feel lucky that I don't go through that kind of physical torture.

I think I'm currently enjoying the high of having come out of that decrepit state, in which I crawled on the floor and hugged the refrigerator among all of the other things I described. I wish this could last, but I fear this might become a trend now. It was really relaxing, in retrospect, though I felt like I was dying at the time. However, I did want to die at the time, and lived the wonderful juxtaposition of trying to strangle myself, and breathing deeply, because I thought the air I was getting was no longer enough with the severe heart palpitations.

The more I think of the work I have ahead of me, and my inabilities, the more I feel like a fish struggling for air, and I feel like I'm losing my mental balance.

So in the end what I want to say is: I thought I could sympathize with people going through extreme pain before, as I had also felt sad and thought I was possibly depressed. But what I just experienced about an hour ago far exceeds the threshold of mental pain, desperation and hopelessness I thought one could experience. If hell does exist, I imagine it can't be any worse than this. But then again, there is probably even worse things I haven't experienced yet.
