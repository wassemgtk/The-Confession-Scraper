Just so y'all know, there's an implicit agreement among a lot of people with lots of money in the market that if Bernie Sanders is elected president, they will be pulling a lot of that money out before he is sworn in so that they can step up their basis before anything happens to the capital gains tax rate. So if you're planning on voting for him, you might want to take your money out of the market now. Or not, considering that this could be construed as insider information. Your call.
