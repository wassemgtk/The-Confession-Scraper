It's starting to bother me that I don't have a job and don't know where I'll live or work in just a few months. While I am happy for all my friends that are set, sometimes I can't help, but feel a bit jealous or wonder what they did that I didn't to get the job. Then there are some times when I learn who got the job offer and I grow bitter because they are not nice people or skip class all the time while I bust my ass.
