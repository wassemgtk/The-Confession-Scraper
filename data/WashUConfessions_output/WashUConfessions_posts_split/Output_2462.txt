The recent confession against racial activism shows how harmful the phrase "check your privilege" can be. While it is true that a large number of black students on campus grew up in very poor environments, the majority are from middle-class or wealthy families... but that doesn't mean they should care any less about issues affecting others with similar heritage to theirs. "Reverse classism" is still classism, and telling people they can't talk about issues they care about just because they have some privilege is very harmful to the movements related to those issues. People who are "privileged" have the privilege to speak up and actually be heard and taken seriously. If only unprivileged people were allowed to speak, many movements (anti-slavery, for example) would have had problems getting off the ground. Privilege can be a powerful weapon if used correctly, and privileged people actually caring about the downtrodden is one of the best things that could happen to our society.
