As a white student here on campus, I am absolutely disgusted and ashamed of many of my peers' responses to the protests surrounding Ferguson and Shaw, which range from clueless to ignorant to racist. As members of the St. Louis community, the lack of empathy and respect for St. Louisans who are fighting for basic equal citizenship rights is appalling. I urge everybody to have some empathy for Michael Brown and Vonderitt Myers (and countless others), at least for the sake of empathy, and to refrain from victim blaming because above all else, their families have lost their sons. To those of you who are posting things on YikYak about the protests and how you think they're stupid, try to imagine what is at stake for the protesters. I challenge you, as a WashU student, to learn something about the other side's perspective. To those of you who are posting straight up racist shit, think about how unsafe that must make your black peers feel. Be better.
