I'm a low income student from Saint Louis. I can honestly say that I have a better relationship and time with the workers here than I do some of my peers. I connect with them, they understand the struggle and they genuinely care for me as well. I'm friends with them on FB and they worry when they don't see me around.

My family isn't very involved with my college life and they make me feel as if I have a home away from home.

As a minority student there is not a large presence of people who look like me at Wash U. They are like family to me and it hurts that people just see it as a stunt. Very sad.
