I was born into a hateful family. When I was growing up, I was taught to 'never trust a Jew'. Although I attend a college with a sizable Jewish population, I have never made friends with a single one, because I still harbor prejudices. My parents believe that those who leave my faith deserve to be executed. When my brother came out as gay, my parents threw him out of the house and have not spoken his name since. I just want to be free, I want to get rid of all the hate that fills my heart. I want to leave my religion and never look back, but most of all, I just want to be my own person. I was thinking about joining a Jewish group on campus and sharing my story. If I did, would I be welcome? I just want to change and I need help.
