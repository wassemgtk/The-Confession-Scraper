ctor of Gamma Chis has requested for me to remove confessions related to sorority recruitment. (Even the positive ones, which apparently are also negatively affecting the recruitment process)

For the time being, I'll just be hiding those confessions instead of deleting them. They'll be back when recruitment ends, but in the meantime, I'll let the recruitment process run its natural course to avoid adding any unnecessary stress. 

Best of wishes for the new semester.

Edit:

Honestly, I don't like this at all either.

If I don't comply, I risk being accused by other Greek organizations of spreading hate against them. The way some people see it, If I keep the posts, then I'm biased against sororities and I'm making their lives harder. Someone might even complain to the administration again. Either way, SOMEONE'S going to be unhappy. 

My gut feeling is to go with the community wants. So if anyone wants to voice their opinion on this matter, please do so - especially those involved in the rush process. I'll be watching this thread and will be reading every comment.
