I have a really good memory. Especially for faces and names. So a lot of the time I will see a face around campus (for example in a 180 person class) and then I will keep seeing them, still remembering the initial encounter. At some point I will probably hear someone say their name. Unintentionally, I will put two and two together and I will always remember it. If I ever meet him or her for real, I have to pretend not to know their name. Sometimes I slip up. It is weird. tl; dr - If I know your name despite never officially having met you I'm not stalking you, I just have a really good memory.
