I am a boy, I'm a senior and I've never had a relationship or ANYTHING with anybody in my life. Sometimes I feel kind of lonely, that I've wasted a lot of time of my life. I would like to know how is to kiss someone you love, to be with that person, to show your love...  but on the other hand I've learnt that thinking about it all the time just make it worse. I think the main problem is that I am not confident enough to show my feelings to another person and that I am always keeping my feelings to myself. The thing is that somehow life has taught me to be that way.
