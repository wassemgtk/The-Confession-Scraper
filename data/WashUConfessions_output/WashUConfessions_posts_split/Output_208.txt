I have a Che Guevara shirt. Not because I admire anything about him. He was decidedly south of Neutral on the Good/Evil axis. No, I have it because I find it incredibly ironic that he spent a good deal of his life railing against capitalism, and yet he is immortalized on often overpriced merchandise in America, in his most hated form of market, in one of his most hated countries. It's incredibly satisfying.
