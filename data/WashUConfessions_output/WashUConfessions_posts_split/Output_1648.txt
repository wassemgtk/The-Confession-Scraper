I don't like that WashU students are known for not tipping well, or for being generally rude customers. I am going to take this as a wake-up call, and pay extra attention to my behavior when at restaurants, especially the ones near WashU. I'm going to make sure to say please and thank you when applicable, to return the pleasant conversation when the staff make small talk with me, and (for as long as I can afford it) tip 25%. I encourage all of you to join me. Let's turn this reputation around and make WashU students be known for being the type of customers you *want* to have in your establishment.
