I'm scared to go home this summer because my family and I have had some history of not getting along well. We're on good terms now but I attribute it to the distance. I have no idea what it would be like to spend 3 months with them again. It's making me anxious. On top of that, I've been feeling out of it and unhappy. Smiling has become an effort and I know I am acting standoffish and aloof. yet I can't help it. I wish I was normal and had someone who loved me.
