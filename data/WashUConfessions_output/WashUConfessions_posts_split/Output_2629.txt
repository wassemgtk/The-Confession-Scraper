Two years ago I met this guy and he was really awesome. He was like a genius and a daredevil; and there were serious sparks between us. The only problem was that he had a girlfriend. She was really wealthy and glamorous, and selective about who she was friends with so she never really gave me a chance.

Anyway one night it was pouring rain and he couldn't ride his motorcycle home so he called me up and asked if he could sleep on the floor of my apartment. I took him in, cooked him a steak and we ended up talking all night and laughing. The next morning he kissed me. He immediately told his girlfriend, and they didn't officially split up for another four months. It was a really messed up situation.

Anyway now him and I have been together for a year and half, but she's still in our lives. She's trying really hard to be my friend, and I'm cool with it but at the same time it kind of bothers me. I found her blog and found a bunch of posts about how much she hated "this girl"... with a lot of information relevant to me. Red light, or what?
