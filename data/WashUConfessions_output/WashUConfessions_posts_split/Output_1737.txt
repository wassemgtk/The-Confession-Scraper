I just found out I didn't get invited back to any sorority parties today. I'm disappointed, but mostly, incredibly embarassed. I told a lot of people that I was rushing, and now I have to tell them all that I basically got cut from the process -- at the very last minute. I was also really excited about joining a sisterhood and having a friend group. I haven't really found that here.
