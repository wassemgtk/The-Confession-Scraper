It's interesting to compare the content of WashU Confessions with the Confessions of state schools. The student confessions here feature very deep personal struggles with depression and drinking; or an intellectual debate on current events or political issues. Whereas at other schools I've seen... well simple stuff... like vulgar stuff about their sex lives and petty drama. I don't know, I think it says something but I'm not sure what.
