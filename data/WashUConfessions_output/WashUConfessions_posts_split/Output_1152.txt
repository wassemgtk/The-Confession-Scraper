I'm an international student who think the U.S. national anthem is aesthetically a wonderful piece of music and like it better than my own national anthem. I'm literally moved to tears whenever I hear it and secretly sing along with the crowd. All these have nothing to do with my identity - 100% aesthetic reasons. However I could not seem to convey this to others...and whenever I'm with an acquaintance (who knows I'm not American) I'll have to try really hard not to sing along or I've gotten comments that are really not nice...
