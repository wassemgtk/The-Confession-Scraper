I steal from my rich friends. I'm poor, but socially I'm surrounded by extreme wealth. I don't resent my friends because they happen to come from rich families. I somehow justify occasionally stealing office supplies or ziploc baggies or food items for later - never money or anything "valuable," at least to them. They are valuable to me. It's easy to justify stealing 30 paperclips when your friend's mom bought her 5000 paperclips when she moved in. I feel bad, but I don't stop. I'm sorry
