I am disgusted by the number of students here that chew with their mouths open and smack their food. How, at the age of 18+, do think chewing with your mouth open is ok? Wouldn't you maybe want to fix this gross, very audible habit, for when you are sitting across the table from that special someone on a dinner date, or with a boss from work over some food? Grow up, and shut your mouth please
