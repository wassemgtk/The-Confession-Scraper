I just got my grades back and I didn't make Dean's List. I'm just frustrated because I'm a junior and I feel like I should have figured things out by now. Yes, my grades are improving but I just feel inadequate relative to my peers because of my learning differences and inability to demonstrate how hard I work in my grades. I just don't know what to do now.
