It really annoys me when student groups buy gear with activity fee funds. Does the social programming board really deserve hoodies before they program any events? Do Uncle Joes and EST members want people to approach and utilize them when they are off-duty and not acting in their volunteer roles? I know custom gear can be pretty expensive and it bugs me when funds are allocated to the property of individual students. Also I'm jealous because they are always way fly.
