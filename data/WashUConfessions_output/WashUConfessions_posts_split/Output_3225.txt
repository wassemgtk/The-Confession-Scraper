I confess, I used to feel like I was being left out but now I'm over the Wash U 'scene'. So I treat school like a job that is a subsection of my life instead of a social domain that consumes my being. Because in the real world, it doesn't matter how 'cool' you are and the people who continue to put up fronts or pretend they are superior are the ones being laughed at. When are college kids gonna stop acting like they're in high school
