To everyone struggling (or even excelling) this midterm season - with stress, loss, anxiety, what have you.

I confess that life is worth living. Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's hard, and sometime's it's just horrific and it's difficult to put one foot in front of the other or even leave bed. Sometimes it feels like the world is shifting under your feet and any semblance of structure in your life is crumbling around you.

That's okay. That is life. But, let's take a step back.

Let's reclaim the day for ourselves. If that seems like too much, let's reclaim this hour, or the next ten minutes. Let's remind ourselves that today, even if we can only convince ourselves of it for a few minutes, life is beautiful. Despite papers and exams and feelings of loneliness or anxiety, let us claim today as a wonderful day where we will appreciate life's difficulties as something we are strong enough to surmount.

I believe in you. I believe that you are all strong enough to put one foot in front of the other, read one more page, work one more problem, keep going step by step until you have reached your goal.

Good luck to everyone in this midterm season. It might not be easy, but you can do it. You will persevere and it will eventually subside.

Good luck.
