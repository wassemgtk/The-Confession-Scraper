Last year I had some local friends over, and they brought some friends that go to Fontbonne. One of my WashU friends made some disparaging joke about the quality of students and education at Fontbonne, and it helped me to realize just how mean it is to trash talk a school because they are not of the same calibre as WashU. The pursuit of education is admirable on any level, and I would expect WashU students to support through their words and actions anyone looking to better themselves.
