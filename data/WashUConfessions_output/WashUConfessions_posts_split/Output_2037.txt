I confess that I hate living with my roommate because he makes me feel bad about myself. We' be become really close, so we talk all the time, and he's definitely the best friend I've made in college. He went to one of the top schools in the country and I'm the only one from my high school to ever come to WashU. We're in the same major, so we have a couple of the same classes, and he does half the work I do but outperforms me on all the exams and homework assignments. We've both joined quite a few clubs and organizations, but mine aren't really conducive to a social environment outside of the meetings, so my only party source is him and his friends. They're nice and all, but I feel like they just see me as his roommate and not an actual person they want to know and befriend. He's just like basically flawless and then here I am, sitting at home on my butt because I feel bad for always accepting his invitations to go out to his events and never having any of my own. I'm really glad I made this friend, but sometimes I wish he weren't so goddamned perfect so I wouldn't feel bad about myself.
