I'm sick of people constantly complaining. If becoming a doctor was easy, everyone would do it.  If WashU is too hard go to an easy school. If WashU isn't fun, try actually BEING fun. If WashU is too sensitive/not sensitive enough but you don't have the motivation to do something to change that, go somewhere else or stop complaining. Don't just sit on the internet complaining, actually do something to make a positive contribution to the community.
