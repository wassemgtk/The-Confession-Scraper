I went on leave for mental health reasons in the middle of a semester, and now I'm behind all my friends. It makes me feel like I'm a fuck-up and an idiot, and I hate it. I don't see anyone I know in class anymore, and I just feel like a loser surrounded by people achieving what I couldn't manage. I crack jokes, but I hate it, I hate it, I hate it.
