No one here seems to understand how much time the arts take. And by that I mean dance, band, orchestra, theater, etc. All of us put in just as much and maybe more time than the athletes, yet we don't get the same type of recognition as them. I wish people would appreciate us more. Next time you see a musician or actor or artist up late doing work, go give them a long bear hug.
