A friend of mine has cheated on her long-distance boyfriend multiple times over the duration of their relationship. They're taking a big step in their relationship (no details to avoid identification), and I just want to tell this guy what has been going on. It's like the elephant in the room, because so many people know but no one will talk about it. I'm not going to tell him because I don't want to deal with the fallout. I think I should, but it'll bring me a lot more trouble than it's worth.
