I'm sure there are some issues with WUPD, as there are with most institutions.  But I just want to thank the WUPD officers that have helped me personally.  I can't speak for everyone's experience but those I have interacted with have been very caring, kind, and understanding.  Their demeanor with students should be a model for police in communities everywhere.  Thank you WUPD!
