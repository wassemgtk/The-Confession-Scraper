I'm a guy who was sexually assaulted by a guy..I can't speak out. I know the comment responses and the help I would get to try to speak out but for specific reasons I just can't....
I just want help to make it better. I really can't explain....and I am really sorry I will not in person, but I need some anonymous support.
