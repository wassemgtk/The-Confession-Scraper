I don't miss home at all.  I love my parents, I like the area where I grew up, and I have great friends from back home... but if I'm being completely honest, all I miss is my dog.  Like I've only cried once this semester and it was when my sister emailed me a picture of my dog.  I'm not sure if this is a good thing, or a really really troubling emotional state.  Advice/condolences welcome
