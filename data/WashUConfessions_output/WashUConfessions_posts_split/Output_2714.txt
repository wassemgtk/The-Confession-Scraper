I confess that I find you fascinating, because you're so passionate about what you love, so set in your convictions, and so incredibly brilliant (and certainly not unattractive, to boot). I would love to become closer to you -  as friends or not. If only I found the confidence to actually talk to you for more than a few minutes at a time, I think we could be good friends. Unfortunately, every time I do talk to you, I feel so utterly outclassed that I realize you can do better than me for a friend.
