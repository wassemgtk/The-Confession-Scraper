I confess that I am troubled by some of the posts concerning the disparity between economic status of WashU students.

Specifically, I am referring to the ones revealing that some students are appalled and/or offended when they learn that their classmates are able to afford tuition here, or hear them discussing how much money they have to spare for amusements.

I completely understand how unfair it seems that some students can coast on their parents' money while others must take out loans and work jobs just to make ends meet. However, what I would like to point out is that some parents (like mine) worked multiple jobs throughout their entire lives with the goal of not only making enough money to live by, but also saving up to be able to help out their children with as much of their college expenses as possible. My parents both started out working menial jobs; then, my mom put my dad through graduate school before having any children; and my family has never gone on vacation in order to continue saving money. Although my parents are unable to pay for all four of my years here, I have been able to afford the first several semesters, and I deeply cherish every single dollar they have been able to provide for me through their sweat, tears, and long hours.

I understand that for people from other socioeconomic backgrounds, the fact that I could even afford one year here may be unbelievable, and I am very aware of how fortunate and privileged I am. I am also aware of how taxing it is to try to juggle school with work, especially since I will have to start doing that from now on. But should I really have to apologize for being able to pay for my tuition so far? Should I have to apologize for my parents' hard work, and being able to use their money to pay for my expenses?

I guess I'm just tired of feeling like I have to justify myself for having any money at all that's not my own. (If you think about it, if society got rid of the ability to pass on our earnings, then no one would ever work more than how much they need to in order to barely get by.) So, what I'm trying to say is that you shouldn't always assume that just because someone can afford tuition here, it means they've always had it easy and they're oblivious of their good fortune.
