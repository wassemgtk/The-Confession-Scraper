I am lonely, overloaded by work, and feel like people only talk to me when they need something from me. Hardly anyone has ever gone out of their way to help me, and I feel like my life is going nowhere. I can't seem to catch a lucky break with anything. I'm only 20 and I already feel meaningless and like I will never amount to anything.
