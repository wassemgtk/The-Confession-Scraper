As a guy, it's frustrating that I can't sexually perform well at all unless I really am attracted to the girl, which could take days, weeks, months to happen. I've tried hooking up a few times before, but every time was a massive disappointment to the girl, just because I wasn't into it. This starts to form a vicious cycle, because I feel pressure to perform really well when I finally do get intimate with a girl I really like, but to perform well I need experience, and I can't get experience because I don't want to really hook up casually.
