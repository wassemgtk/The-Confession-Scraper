I'll come out with something I haven't told people before. The only reason I'm here at Wash U is because of affirmative action. My test numbers were low to mediocre at best. I led a fairly uninteresting life before Wash U. 24 other people from my graduating class applied to Wash U with about the same numbers as me, and only one of them got in. No, I'm here because I'm black.
