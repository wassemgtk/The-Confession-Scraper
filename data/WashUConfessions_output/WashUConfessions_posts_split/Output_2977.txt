sion #856

Here's my confession. I'm sick of this bullshit excuse for wifi across campus. How dare this university spend $50,000 on renovating the Whispers counter before fixing what one can only refer to as an absolute staple for learning in our generation. I'm sick of seeing lawn care prioritized before our basic needs. Just look at Confession 851. This school cares more about its image than its students. I'm sending this from my iPhone because my computer won't connect to the wifi. This university's allocation of money is a joke. Oh, and what the fuck are we doing paying that guy at the village grill line to stand there and bitch at us?
