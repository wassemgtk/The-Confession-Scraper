I'm a male and I am finally considering the possibility that I may be bisexual. For a long time, I tried to pass my interest in men as a phase, but now I'm not so sure. The thing is, I don't want to come out as bisexual if that means that I'll scare women off. I am genuinely attracted to women and I want to continue having the option of having a romantic relationship with one (as I have had in the past). But whenever I ask myself the question "If I was a straight woman, would I want to date or marry a man who is also attracted to other men?" I answer "no."
