I have an intense love and hate relationship with whoever broke up with Adele. I hate the asshole, wondering how the fuck do you break someone's heart so bad that she sings so painfully and sorrowfully but at the same time I'm like, I won't be able to hear dat most beautiful voice in the world had it not been for that bastard.
