While we are on the subject of discrimination, I feel that there is too much swole-shaming going on around campus. Negative perceptions about my personality are often inferred. People are surprised when they discover I am not vain or judgmental.

Members of the opposite sex seem to look at me as an object and not understand me for the multidimensional person I am, and it is heartbreaking. Potential partners have turned me down because they think they would become self conscious about their bodies. People I eat with often comment on the amount of food that I eat. They either make it seem as if I am privileged to eat that amount "guilt-free", or that I am wasting resources by taking care of myself. I get scoffed at when I set bedtimes on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday nights. Family and strangers often insist about how "being too muscular" is "unhealthy", and try to intervene in my lifestyle choices.

When I propose a portion of my lifestyle to people asking help, they oftentimes reply that my solution would overshoot their goals- discrediting the hard work and discipline for my lifestyle.

I believe that we should act upon the realization that stereotyping and discrimination comes in more flavors than gender, sexuality, or race. Unfortunately, I am afraid to talk to many people about the ways I feel marginalized as a result of my lifestyle choices.
