I am a recent WashU graduate and I felt so much pressure to do something after college that I just applied for jobs I thought I could get without any consideration for what I wanted to do. And now I regret taking the first job offer I got instead of working harder to do something I was truly interested in or taking a chance and waiting to hear from other places.
