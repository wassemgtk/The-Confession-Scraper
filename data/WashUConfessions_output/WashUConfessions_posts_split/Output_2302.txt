I confess that, thanks to my dad's emotionally degrading reactions to any small failure on my part, I almost break down in tears anytime I think about asking a girl on a date. I'm so convinced that she'll say no (whoever she is) that I can barely bring myself to think about it, which I then regard as a failure on my part. I feel like a boy because I'm in tears of fear as I write this, even though I'll be 23 in a few months.
