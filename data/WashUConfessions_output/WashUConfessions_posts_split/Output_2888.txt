I'm a drug addict, and I know of more than a few other WashU students who are in the same boat as me. While I haven't done my drug of choice since last semester, I still go to meetings for it. I'm appalled that WashU has no substance abuse group. You'd think at a university as stressful as this they'd have more than just one counselor for addicts. Group has been proven time and time again to be the single most effective type of treatment, and yet WashU, for what I'm sure are image purposes, doesn't have one.
