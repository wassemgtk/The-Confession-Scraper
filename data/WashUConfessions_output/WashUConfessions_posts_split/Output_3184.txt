i really wish I had gone greek.. my friendships with my friends who joined fraternities has deteriorated every semester since spring of freshman yr and i miss out on events. For example. kappa karaoke seems really fun and I wish I had a just to experience that. I wish i got to go to formals. I wish I could get to know more people (guys and girls). I feel left out of events like Linus and even just going out on the weekends. not going greek is my biggest regret of college. It really prevented me having the best time of my life.
