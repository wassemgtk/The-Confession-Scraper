I wish that Wash U (and other elite institutions) would make more of a concerted effort to recruit students from rural populations. While efforts at increasing racial and ethnic diversity have brought great benefits to these schools, perspectives from the broad swath of rural America seem to be missing from the conversation as the majority of the population consists of students from big cities and their wealthy suburbs. I think in many ways the experiences of these rural students are much different from those of the majority of the population of our school and others like it and our institutions would benefit from an increased focus on recruiting students, many of whom may never even consider an elite school due to the insular environment these communities can sometimes engender.
