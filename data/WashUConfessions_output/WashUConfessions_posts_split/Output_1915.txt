Based on many of the recent WashU confessions, I think people are freaking out WAY too much about grades/GPA. Your GPA does not define you and no matter what your grades are, having a degree from WashU is incredibly helpful. Ask any working adult and they will tell you the same thing. College is a once in a lifetime experience, so stop stressing so much and enjoy it!
