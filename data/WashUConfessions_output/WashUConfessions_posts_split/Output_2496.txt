I confess that I find it extremely difficult to not judge people that are in Greek Life. It's hard for me to see the value in after just a few days of rushing commiting to letters you don't even understand yet and calling people you just met brothers or sisters. I find it hypocritical and to be completely honest, if I would have known Greek Life was so prevalent in Wash U I would never have applied here.  I don't mean to offend anyone, to each his own--but I think that people considering to rush should really consider their values deeply before pledging. Don't do it just because you think everyone else is doing it.
