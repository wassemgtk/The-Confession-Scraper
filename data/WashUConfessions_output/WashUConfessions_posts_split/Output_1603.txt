This is a 2 part confession on 50 Shades of Grey.

Part 1.  I confess that I actually do want to see.  Curiosity can go ahead and kill me.

Part 2.  If someone wanted to set up a protest where actual members of the kink community lead BDSM sessions during and or right after showings of the film, I'd be all about that
