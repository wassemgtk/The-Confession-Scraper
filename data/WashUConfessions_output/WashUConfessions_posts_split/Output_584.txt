The Classics department is truly amazing. I have been involved in several departments through majors, minors, transfers, and other activities, and no other department has more warm, friendly, caring, and enthusiastic faculty.
Not a classics major because I suck at Latin and prefer hard sciences and math. Still, they rock!
