I confess that my RAs this year are awful. They haven't asked for any resident input, and just spontaneously run programs about things that are important to them, and then when nobody shows up, they wander the dorm knocking on doors.

To all you RAs out there who aren't getting the turnout you want: maybe you should ask your residents what THEY want to do, instead of putting on the programs that YOU want.
