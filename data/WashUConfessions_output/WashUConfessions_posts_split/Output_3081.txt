It makes me sound like a spoilt rich person (oh wait, I am...), but honestly, for the amount of money we pay to live on-campus, I feel like reslife should be able to provide our dorm with consistent hot water. (It's been off-and-on for the past week, and yes, multiple maintenance requests have been submitted, before you go off on me for venting on WashU confessions but not actually dealing with the problem.)
