I confess that i have unpredictable rage attacks. Not visible outward rage, oh no. I appear calm, but I'm so angry inside that it takes all of my emotional strength not to punch even my best friend in the face if he so much as talks to me in that condition. It's actually scary and I dont know what to do. I have no one here I can talk to and this thing is destroying me.

If your answer is a medical professional of any kind, just don't even bother replying. I've been to several and they've tried pretty much everything in the book. Nothing has worked at all.
