Sometimes I just feel so jealous seeing my super outgoing friends make such intimate, meaningful connections with so many people seemingly effortlessly when I struggle so much to make deeper relations. It would be nice to know that I've made a real positive impact in someone's life, to have someone explicitly say that they value my friendship.

But I realized there are probably people in my life who feel the same way. So I'm trying to make an effort to really explicitly say to all the people in my life what they mean to me and how much I appreciate them. It's kinda hard since I'm a bit awkward, but hopefully it'll get easier the more I do it. I would urge everyone to do the same, especially with those friends you're not as close with or don't see as often. You never know what it could mean to someone to hear that they are appreciated or that they've really positively impacted another person's life.
