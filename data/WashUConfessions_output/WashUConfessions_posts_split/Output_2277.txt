I have very few memories of my dad while we had a good relationship. One of them is very simple. Every Sunday he would visit and bring me Starbucks. I didn’t like really strong coffee or anything (I was in middle school), but fall was always a special time. It was always a tradition for him to bring me a pumpkin spice latte and something sweet like a scone or a cookie. The good times didn’t last for very long after that, and now he’s dead. So call me a “basic bitch” for getting something pumpkin flavored. I don’t really care. Because for some reason that’s what fall means to me, and it helps me remember the good times I had with him before he ruined my life and his.
