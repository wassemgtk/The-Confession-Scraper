I have accepted the fact that no one wants to be with me.
I am living a life where everybody I become interested in either ends in pointless hookups or rejection. I no longer expect my attempts to pursue anyone as possibly ending in any sort of relationship. People want to use me and move on.
It's more than that, though. I am that person at parties who stands and watches. Listens to the conversations. Says nothing because no one will notice. I've been trained through pure social interaction not to say anything.
The worst part is knowing that I've become used to this. I find myself refusing to fight the above circumstances, because it feels easier to just fade into the walls. When I think about people, the only thought I have is recognition that they are thinking of anything but me. I have become a hollow shell, devoid of affection for anyone. My kindest interactions have become pure placation.
I would hate being someone else and knowing this about me. But I feel like my past has shaped me into this person and there's nothing I can do but live as a silent observer. Grow alone. Become a social vagabond, moving from groups of people to amorphous groups of people.
This isn't some post where I need pity. That's the last thing I need - like feeling locked in a cage of glass for everyone to see. Like a doll on a shelf. Here's what you can do: find that person no one notices. That person that stands alone and observes. Talk to them. Make them feel important. Sure, it makes us uncomfortable to be suddenly recognized. We never asked for it, and frankly in that moment we probably don't want it. But somewhere in the back of our minds it feels good, even if only for a moment.
