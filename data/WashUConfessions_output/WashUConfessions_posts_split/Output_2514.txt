I confess that oftentimes people say I come on too strongly even when I'm being positive. What they don't know is that deep inside I have severe social anxiety, and trying to put myself out there is my way of coping with it. Every time I hear someone saying I'm too aggressive or excited, it crushes me inside because they don't know they are criticizing the only version of me that's actually confident enough to go out and do things, and they can't see the countless hours I spent psyching myself up to even be able to leave my room. Lately that has been a horrible loop that has started to affect my studies because it's taken me longer to get out of bed to go to class, and I feel nobody cares because they wish I wasn't even around.
