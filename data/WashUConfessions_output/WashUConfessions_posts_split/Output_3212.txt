Hey guys, just wanted to share. I'm part of your average family. I've got a dad, a mom and...a sister. That's Donnie, we found him and Darwin, he found us. About our house, It moves because we travel all over the world. You see my dad holds his nature show and...my mom shoots it. Okay so we're not that average, but between you and me, something amazing happened and now I can talk to animals. It's pretty cool and totally secret and you know what? Life will never be the same.
