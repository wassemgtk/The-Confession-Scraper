A girl from my high school graduated and was beginning a career as a model. In September, she won a prestigious modeling competition. She was recently awarded a modeling contract, and last night, she went over to visit her grandparents.

After visiting her grandparents, she walked to a bus stop. Along the way, someone opened fire and she was shot and killed.

Sometimes at WashU it is hard to maintain perspective. It is important to remember how lucky we are to be here, to have the opportunities to pursue our dreams.
