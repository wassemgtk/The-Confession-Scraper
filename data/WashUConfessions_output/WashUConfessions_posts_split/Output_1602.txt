Black people are (mostly) terrible about explaining white privilege to white people. It's really not a difficult concept, but no white person is going to accept it if they feel like they're being attacked. I'm white, I get easy treatment from police all the time. I've been caught with drugs before by police and I've been let off with warnings. It was explained to me thusly: white privilege is the stuff that you DON'T have to worry about as a white person. Are the police/store owners/etc. watching me? Will I be pulled over because I'm black and driving a nice-ish car? Will the job I'm interviewing for not hire me because of a particular hair style? Will people think I've only gotten into this university because I'm black? Will people just assume I'm less qualified to be here because of affirmative action? This is shit that I, as a white person, have never had to worry about. Ever.
