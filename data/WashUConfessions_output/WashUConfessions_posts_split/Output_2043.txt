I know that there are a lot of problems at Wash U, and that some people are unhappy, but I really have to say that these three years have been some of the best years of my life. I came into college not wanting to join a sorority, and luckily I found a close group of friends who also wanted to stay independent. I am so grateful to have friends who are there when I need them. But I am also grateful for the people I see around campus who are extraordinarily friendly and smile at me when I'm having a bad day. Thanks to all who make Wash U so amazing!
