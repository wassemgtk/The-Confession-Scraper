Every time I tell people 'I am single', they are like 'aw, don't worry, you will find someone soon' with their pity eyes. But I just state a fact rather than feel sad / pathetic about myself.

I am totally comfortable being single. Having a relationship is nice, but it's not a must; one don't need a partner to make life perfect, but instead one has to be able to handle their own life first before having another person in their life.
