After seeing so many depressed messages, I really want to say something to cheer up who would like to be postive. I am a transfer student from a non-English speaking country. 2 years ago when I arrived here, I did not expect any language barriers, because I thought my English was good. However, I had a very hard time understanding the professor first semester. It's getting better but honestly, I still cannot understand everything in class. Seeing all the other students taking notes, asking questions and getting really good grades, I was so sad, because I was a good student (academically) like them too. I cried every other week after the grades came out. There was a time that I really want to quit and go back home. Thanks to my parents. They told me that I am not perfect. I do not need to be perfect and I do not need to compare myself to others. All I need to do is to accept that I am not perfect but I can always do better. It's better for me to focus on my own improvements: getting a better understanding of the course material, being able to speak up and ask questions in class, gaining knowledge instead of focusing on grades etc.. I think many people know this but they might not be able to notice their own improvements. Now, I still spend a really long time doing homework every day. Sometimes I do bad in the exam though I thought I spend enough time on it. But, I know I am making very slow progress.... very slow. I like going to classes every day because I enjoy learning something new every day. Looking back, I just want to laugh at myself: There are so many ways to enjoy a great day and college life. Why did I choose to remain upset and blame myself on not being perfect? Those bad feelings did not help anything. So, cheer up everybody! Life is good! All the difficuties you met were training you to be a tough human being then you will not be scared in the future, because life will always be harder when you become older lol (your parents might agree with this). But do you really care? I think you are awsome. You can handle it! Sincerely, a Senior who really do not want to graduate. Enjoy Wash U.
