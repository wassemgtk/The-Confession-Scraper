I dated a guy for almost four years and we broke up so we wouldnt have to do long distance. He was my first everything. I hooked up with another guy to try to get over him. I felt so shitty about it over these past few months that I've just become so cold and I pushed my ex away. Today I told him that I didn't see him in my future. I proceeded to then tell him what I did to get over him. I have never seen man cry so hard. I am the shittest person alive. He doesnt deserve that. I honestly dont even know why Im writing this here out of all places. I have no one to turn to and I just feel so shitty. I wish I could take the pain away but I can't. Even at 23 years old, I still feel helpless. If you're reading this you know who you are. Im sorry. I really am. I dont know what else to do. I wish I could take the pain away
