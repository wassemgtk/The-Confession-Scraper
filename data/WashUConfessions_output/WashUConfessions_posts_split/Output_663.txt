I think as long as Wash U isn't a dry campus, there will be large numbers of people reporting unwanted sexual contact. Sex is another story, but I'm talking about stuff that's not quite intercourse. When you're drunk, you make choices you'll regret in the morning whether you're male or female. Not advocating prohibition, but maybe if you don't want to have regrets you shouldn't get blackout drunk. Obviously there are tragic cases where drinks are spiked, etc., but much of the time it's people drinking a ton, regretting what they did when they were drunk, and blaming people who were probably just as drunk.
