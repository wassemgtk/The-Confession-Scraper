Today, when I was on the Metro back to campus, a man sat next to me and started talking. Now, I was scared shitless because he looked like he could punch a hole through me, then drain all my blood to feed his dogs.

I expected something like this to happen to me sooner or later in St. Louis, so I prayed for another delicious burrito before I died and prepared to murmur the most neutral responses I could think of for the next ten minutes.

Then, he told me that he saved a young girl from getting crushed between the Metro doors once.

She was nine or so, and he pulled her in right when the doors were about to close on her arms.

Before he left, he told me his name was that of a Greek Hero's. "'Because I did a lot of this on the street," he jokingly punched the air a couple times.

---I wanted to share this encounter because one, it's a super awesome story in general, and two, because despite all the madness around us, there is some good in everyone.

So peace out, y'all!
