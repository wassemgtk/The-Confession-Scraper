I confess that I am a sex addict. I’m 21 and I’ve already had sex with more than fifty people. It’s reached the point where I have to sleep with at least one person a day in order to satisfy my addiction. I have to balance having four or five fuck buddies at a time in order to make sure that at least one is available when I want sex. Well, guess what? I’m a heterosexual, attractive woman. This makes it even harder to break my addiction because it’s always so easy to find a generally attractive man that will be more than happy to have a one-night-stand or no-strings-attached relationship. It was easy to learn how to expertly and quickly pick up men for hookups.

When I first starting having all this sex, I did it as a kind of crazy social experiment. My desire was to prove to myself and others that a woman can play the same game as men in our hookup culture…that it was easy to have a random hookup with a man and not care at all to ever see him again….that I could use men just for my sexual pleasure in the same way that many men use women. This desire stemmed shortly after I was raped by two men. After that happened, sex lost all its emotional value for me. I was frustrated and angry over this value that I lost, so I sought a mental revenge against men. I would use them the same way they had used me.

Alas, my emotionally hollow sex life has only made me feel more frustrated and angry because now, in addition to having lost its emotional value, sex is starting to lose its physical value. It’s hard to get turned on when you’ve seen and done it all often. I feel guilty for the way I use men, especially when they fall for me and I reject them. To be fair, they usually fall for my body or the way I sexually please them, not for the whole me. But I refuse them the chance to try a traditional, exclusive relationship because I can’t bring myself to trust a single man and because that would require me to stop myself from sleeping with another man, something very difficult to do when I have a sex addiction. In my sick mind, all men only want to use me, when in reality, I’m the one using them.
