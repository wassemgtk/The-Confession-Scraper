I recently broke up with my SO because the long distance relationship wasn't working out. But i still feel so sad about it. I was the one to break it off, but I feel worse than I did before. My ex is really a great person, and I couldn't think any higher of them, but small things nagged at me about our relationship and I just broke it off. They said some really sad things when I told them I wanted to end our relationship. I feel so bad every time I think about it. And after all this, I selfishly still hope I can still be friends with them. Sorry for the rant. I just wanted to tell someone.
