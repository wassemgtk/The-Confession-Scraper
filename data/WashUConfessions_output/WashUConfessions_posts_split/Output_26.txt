A past member of a student group I am in committed suicide on Friday. Today, we received an email listing the counseling options offered by Wash U SHS. As someone else who has suffered from depression and anxiety, I know first hand exactly how mismanaged the mental health services are on campus I know this because I have sought them out in the past. It honestly feels like a punch in the gut to know that not only has one of my sisters lost her life, but that Wash U and our organization at large think that directing us towards a counseling service with a wait-list into next semester is an appropriate way to react. I want an open and honest discussion, but I don't see an opportunity for one to ever take place.
