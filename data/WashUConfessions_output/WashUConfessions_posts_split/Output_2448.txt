I'm all for the feminist movement in other countries, but I think you the movement has achieved the maximum it can here in the US. Personally I think the purpose of the movement in this country is an attempt to change stuff that is so culturally ingrained that it's nearly impossible to change.

I might feel this way because I was raised in a different country (A country where women don't have anything close to what you guys have here), but I just can't see what the purpose of the movement is here.

I feel that racism is much more prevalent and much more of an issue than feminism, in my day to day life I don't see where women are treated differently because they are women- you guys have all the same opportunities.
