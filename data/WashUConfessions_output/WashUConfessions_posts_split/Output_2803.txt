I'm single for the first time in over 5 years, and I spend so much time wondering if my ex regrets ruining my life. I keep going back and forth between wanting to call him up and ask if it was worth it and wanting to call him up and ask why we can't talk anymore, but I know I shouldn't do either. I'm over him in the sense that I don't want him back and I'm moving on; that being said, I hope he's happy enough that it's not eating at him, but unhappy enough that he knows he made a mistake that he can't undo.
