When I was growing up, my parents were demanding. Nothing I did was ever good enough for them. I applied to WashU partly to earn my mother's approval. The day we found out I was accepted in to WashU, one of the most competitive schools there is, my mother broke into tears and hugged me. I was so happy I finally knew she was proud of me. But at what cost? Constantly trying to live up to her ridiculous expectations as a child killed my self-esteem. Additionally, my older brother verbally abused me for years, making me feel even more worthless. I was suicidal in high school but not anymore. Things have gotten better, but my self-esteem is so wrecked I don't think I'll ever heal emotionally. I don't think I'll ever forgive my family because they are the reason that even though I know I have value as a person, I can't convince myself of it.
