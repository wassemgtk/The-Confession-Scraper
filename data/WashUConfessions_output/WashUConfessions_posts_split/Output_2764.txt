To 1060.  Ironically enough, I could probably be a genuine platonic friend because of your confession.  The fact is, I fundamentally disagree with what you're saying so I'm guessing we wouldn't be a good match.  But I am dying to talk this out with you.  So please reach out! We can sit in Whispers, talk about it, get way to personal, maybe even make a scene and get the people around us in on the discussion.  Could be fun !
