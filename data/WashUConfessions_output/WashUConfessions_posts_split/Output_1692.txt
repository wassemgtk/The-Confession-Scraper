I struggled with alcohol abuse and promiscuity in my freshmen year. I'm better now and have found out that I'm bipolar and am getting treated, which is great. However, it's still hard to see how easily everyone judged me then. When I look at my behavior from last year, I see someone on the path to self-destruction, and clearly exhibiting signs of it, but it doesn't seem like anyone (including my RA) was concerned about my actual health, and rather just wanted to look down on me. It hurts.
