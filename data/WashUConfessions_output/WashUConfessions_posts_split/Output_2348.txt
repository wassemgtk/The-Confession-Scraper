I confess that as much as I love washu and the friends and experiences I have had here, I feel like I can't compete academically. I just got back a couple of exams from my classes and I didn't even meet the average for any of them. This is my last year to prove to my parents that I belong here by pulling my GPA up (it's pretty shitty right now), otherwise they're going to pull me out. I thought I could do it but now I keep doubting myself and I'm not sure what to do anymore. I feel like if I try my hardest and my best, I could manage to do it, but my motivation is so low that trying in and of itself is hard. It doesn't help that I've been having to deal with depressive thoughts and issues for the past couple years and haven't really had treatment yet. I feel so lost.
