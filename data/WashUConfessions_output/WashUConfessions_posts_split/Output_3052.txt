My parents both passed away when I was really little and I basically don't remember anything about them. I had to move in with my Uncle, Aunt, and cousin. I don't know why but I just feel like they've never really accepted me. I think my Aunt resents me because I remind her of the sister she lost and my cousin always makes me miserable. I basically went through life with no friends, thinking I was just this average, scrawny, kid with hair that never looks right. On my 11th birthday I finally found out that there is something I'm good at, that I actually am special and I got accepted to a special school for gifted students. I finally made 2 friends but life was still hard. Surprisingly, the school wasn't exactly the safest place and one of my professors was really out to get me. And now there are also all these huge expectations for me, that I'm destined to do great things or something, and I'm really worried that I can't live up to them. I don't know, I mean... I just don't know if I'm ready to face Lord Voldemort, yknow?
