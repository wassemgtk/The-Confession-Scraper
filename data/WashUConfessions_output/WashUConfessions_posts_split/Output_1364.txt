One of my close friends just told me that she was diagnosed with cancer. It's treatable, but she'll have to have surgery within the next couple months. I want to be a good friend to her and be there for her. I offered and am going to go to her doctors appointments as support. I guess I'm submitting this confession because I just wanted to express how worried I am about her. Also, I would appreciate any suggestions on how to support her further since I'm still in shock and am not completely sure how to completely be there for her.
