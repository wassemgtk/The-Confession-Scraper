Thank you to the girl who let me walk under her umbrella with her when I got caught out in the rain today. I am posting it here since WashU admires doesn't work anymore.

I suppose I also have to make a confession. It was raining heavily after a Calc exam review session my freshman year. When I walked outside my glasses got all fogged up and covered with water so I couldn't see very well. A girl who must have also been the review session started walking next to me. We started a conversation and she obviously knew me (she called me by my name).  We had a wonderful talk on our way back to the South 40. I was shy my freshman year, but she was so friendly that my social awkwardness didn't kick in.

At the end of the conversation I asked what her name was since I couldn't see very well. She seemed hurt by this question and just walked away. I still don't know who she was. I hope she reads this and realizes I asked that question because I couldn't see her face through my foggy glasses and not because she was a forgettable person. I still remember her years later during my Senior year. I'm sorry.
