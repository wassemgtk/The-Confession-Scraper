I secretly want to cry myself to sleep every night. I recently got into a new relationship, one I'm not sure im ready for, my grades suck, and it doesn't seem like I'll get an internship this summer. And the worst part, the only person I felt like I could really tell this to is WashU confessions. Cause otherwise people who know I have anxiety problems would start tiptoeing around me and everyone else would roll their eyes and say I haven't worked hard enough. Which could in fact be true, but given the situation, I gave it my all.
