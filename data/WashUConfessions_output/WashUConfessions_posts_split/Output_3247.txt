i can't stand people at the gym who have no idea what they're doing. working abs is essentially pointless, you don't get a 6 pack/killer abs from "toning" you get it from having a low body fat % (usually around 10 - 14%). in fact, "toning" and "spot reduction" are myths. fat loss is caused by a caloric deficit in your diet aka spending more than you're taking in - cardio is useful for this. machine work is a joke. throwing weights around with piss poor form is only gonna get you hurt. if you don't do reps with a full range of motion, it doesn't count you pansy. low rep ranges (1 - 6 or so) are best for building strength, medium rep ranges ( 7 - 13 or so) are best for building muscle mass, and higher rep ranges are best for increasing endurance. you wanna get big and strong??? lift big eat big, also sleep big. And most importantly...don't ever curl in the squat rack.
