I'm in an arranged marriage and can't quite bring myself to share that fact with anyone. I don't really put myself out there (shy introvert), so I guess the arrangement is good in that I won't end up alone, but it's strange to think that I'll be marrying someone in a few years when I've never even been on a date.
