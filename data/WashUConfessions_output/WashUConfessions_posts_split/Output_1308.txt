Hi admin,

I am a representative of Uncle Joe’s and am wondering if you would feel comfortable sharing the following on the Confessions page. We figure our target audience for this event overlaps with followers of this page. Thank you for everything you do!

“Uncle Joe's presents a new event, set tentatively for April 20th, called Worlds: Sharing WashU Student Narratives. Currently we are in the process of recruiting student writing. Possible writing themes are limitless: from mental illness to sexuality and gender identity, disordered eating, academic stress and more, we are looking for any pieces (written in narrative or poetry style) that touch on the student experience at WashU. Worlds is a chance for your story to be heard.

Please fill out this form if you would like to submit a story:

Works submitted will remain anonymous and will not in any shape or form be altered without the author's permission. All writing will be read by selected student readers.

Please fill out this form if you would like to be a reader:

ALL SUBMISSIONS ARE DUE MONDAY, APRIL 13TH.”
