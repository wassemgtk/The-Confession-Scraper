I confess have a somewhat laughable dilemma and really need help! But, let me preface this by saying I don't consider this racist and hope not to offend anyone.

I really find a girl I know through mutual friends attractive, and kind of get the vibe that she's into me too.  The problem is, she's asian and has an exact replica of her on campus. Like straight how i met your mother doppleganger status! I'm also very distantly friends with that girl too, so if I mix them up, you see the predicament.

I've never been good at remembering names, but it's especially difficult when distinguishing asian people. I think it's because I come from an area that doesn't have many.

Anyways, WHAT DO I DO?
