I feel like my placement on any sexual orientation spectrum is a mess highly conflated by personal experiences and misguided childhood perspectives. It isn't necessary or appropriate to explain myself to other people. Alternatively could everyone just stop talking about me, or any other human being as a run of the mill heteronormative person? Unless of course they go ahead and tell you their run of the mill heteronormative, then its fine. The model of assuming people's non-visible orientation as default hetero until proven something else is downright annoying, and often connotes that any identification outside of that requires some sort of evidence to prove its validity. I understand that if people experience male-female attraction it may seem natural to pose questions or statements that make the assumption others do too. Just consider that people who don't feel like you do could be getting alienated.
