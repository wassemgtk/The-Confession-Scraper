I've noticed that my roomate has been extremely stressed lately. She's an international student and really loves math, especially the beauty of proofs. But she feels like she isn't doing too well in the class. I tell her, like what all the professors say, college is the time to fail. She says that with all of the money that her parents are spending for her to come to WashU, she feels like she can't afford to fail. 

People don't realize that international students are here on a student visa, and thus cannot work under the law. With no financial aid and a high cost of living and transportation, internationals often must deal with the frustration of spending money but not being able to make any to alleviate their parents' burdens. I can always try to get a side job but she can't. Even though my roommate's parents tell her that her grades don't matter and that they are ok with whatever major she chooses, she feels an immense guilt. 

Her parents are spending so much money, and she can't guarantee an equal "return" on this investment in her education. She isn't guaranteed a job in her home country or here (due to an H1-B visa lottery system). Pursuing her "passions" might not be the most practical or soul-satisfying thing when this much money is at stake. 

We often see international students as part of exclusive "cliques," unwilling to interact with us. They do face different problems that we, as citizens, may not have to stress about at all. But we all struggle sometimes here at WashU; empathy hopefully will make it just a little bit more bearable.
