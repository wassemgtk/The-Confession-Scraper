I like writing silly poems, and here's the one for today!

When the wind is too strong
and rain too cold
When a decent grade
seems out of reach
and all your friends
smell like a grinch
get a cup of hot chocolate
and go to bed!
Thinking is good
(who can disagree?)
but constantly thinking
about what couda shoulda woulda
can be a bad curse
that will drag you to your
ddddd00000oooooooommmmm.
So lighten up!
And get some cheesecake with that hot hot coco,
and please please please
don't go off with the lemmings
because the people around you
will miss you terribly.
