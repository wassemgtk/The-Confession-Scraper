It's funny how the post on Class of 2015's public page got deleted twice just today, and the post now have 108 likes and no comment. I have been checking my university email all day and we the student body have not got a single response from the university about this issue. Students are so afraid to show support that only a few people spoke up on this confessions page. I will admit that after seeing this post, WashU is starting to feel like an autocracy. I also feel deeply ashamed that I too only dare to voice my objections through this page anonymously. Should be we be more brave? I think if we can't be, this thing is just going to blow over quietly soon.
