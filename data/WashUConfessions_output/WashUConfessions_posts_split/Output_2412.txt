I confessed that I really hate PLTL. I do not like the system at all. I have done it many times through both Chem and Calc and at both I felt completely inadequate and stupid. I thought it was a meeting for kids who did not understand the material to work together to finish it, but instead it was always, at least in my case, the chance for one or two kids who knew everything to shine and feel confident and make me feel like crap because I didn't know anything. I always felt the unhappiness of the others when I needed to redo a problem or needed it explained to me. The other group members do not want to waste time and not finish the set or not leave early just because one or two people do not understand it. Instead, I usually just sit there and be quiet and only volunteer for scribe so I would not need to say anything and hold the group up. However, I wanted to try to really understand since Calc is so hard for me so I spoke up more but this didn't help and showed my ignorance. Just the last time I went, one of the other members spoke to me like I was an idiot and obviously thought he was doing a favor by "teaching me". I understand trying to help, but the air of being better than me is very disheartening and does not make PLTL enjoyable. So now I am reverting back to not speaking at all and dread PLTL. I feel this actually hinders me because I feel so behind, but I am to scared to speak up to get help. I emailed some tutors but I have had no response and some of  the math TAs are sometimes rude and unhelpful and are not a weekly thing I can utilize to help every week. Any suggestions?
