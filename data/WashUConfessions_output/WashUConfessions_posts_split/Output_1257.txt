Why, why is it so hard to find a guy who wants a relationship rather than hook-up??? As someone whose sexual pleasure intertwines with emotional tie, I'm not only sexually but also emotionally frustrated. After I broke up with my last guy, I started making out with people I meet at parties or Tinder, but it just feels not great. It feels empty, meaningless, boring and even a bit disgusting. For me, if there is no emotion tie, it's hard to be sexually awaken, not to mention experiencing pleasure. I wish our culture could encourage both relationship and hook-up, so that people will have more choices and don't need to pretend promiscuous if they want something meaningful.
