A message to the student organizers of Wash U's protests:

Thank you for all of the time, effort, and emotion you have put into leading the campus's efforts to stand in solidarity and fight for racial equality. I admire your bold action to stand in front of hundreds of students and make a statement to push for a just system. I have participated in multiple rallies that you have organized and believe in their power to express solidarity, empower those feeling the impact of recent events and their long-lasting history, and advocate for change.

This post's purpose is two-fold. (1) Thank you for your action and encouragement and (2) request that more information be provided as to the intended course of action at Action events.

The most recent protest, on December 4, made me question my involvement in Wash U's protests. Some students who participated in the protest and avidly believe in its intent felt pressured to follow the crowd at the protest when it moved off course from the expressed plan. Some students were uncomfortable entering the library, others were uncomfortable with moving to upper floors. Some students felt pressure walking through the street and others did not want to stand in the intersection at Forsyth and Skinker.

Many students' involvement in protests is beyond their comfort zone, questioned by family members, or disapproved of by friends. It is vital that we encourage involvement in protests rather than push supporters away. Yes, this is an issue that you may believe is worthy of blocking intersections and taking a stance in the library. But it is critical that we recognize that not every student feels the same way and we do not want to lose allies by pushing people beyond their limits without warning. It is difficult to make in the moment decisions. While no one forced students to continue participating, the pressure of the moment caused involvement that many students did not want to have. I simply request that the intended or potential course of action of each protest is clear so that each individual can decide their involvement.

Thank you again for your leadership, support, and action.

P.S.: Is there a form through which members of the student body can contact you with concerns, suggestions, or requests for further involvement?  This seemed like the best way to make contact.
