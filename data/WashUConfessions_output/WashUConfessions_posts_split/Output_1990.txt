I confess that I'm not sure if I would have gotten through this semester without Yik Yak. I know that sounds lame and lots of people complain about people posting about "depression" stuff. But sometimes I just have no where else to toss out those thoughts I have. And knowing that there are other people on campus in the same boat as me, strangers that will reach out to support me at something as simple as not being able to get out of the bed in the morning from being so depressed. Sometimes that's a message I can no longer send out to my friends and strain them for that support. But even if it's just a stupid social media site like yik yak, it gives me support and reminds me I'm not alone. And that means a lot.
