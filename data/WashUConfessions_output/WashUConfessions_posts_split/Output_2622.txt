I confess that I feel unwanted. Not so much at school as on this earth. My brother's by far the favorite son, so I've been effectively cast aside by my family. My high school "friends" don't even remember my name. My college "friends," for the most part, don't even care enough to text me back when I ask them how they're doing. In no way do I want to die, but I've been wondering, if I did, who would care? The only answer I can come up with is pretty much nobody. Life would just go on as if I never existed.
