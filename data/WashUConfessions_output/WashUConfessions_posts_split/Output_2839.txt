I think I've had some mental health issues in the past. I'm alright for the most part right now, thankfully, but I'm worried about what could happen in the future. Does anybody know if there's a way to get help at SHS or elsewhere for mental health without it showing up on your insurance/record? (For various reasons, I'd prefer my family not know.) I know about Uncle Joe's, but they can't do long-term treatment. Sorry if this isn't an appropriate forum for this post, but I didn't know how else to ask.
