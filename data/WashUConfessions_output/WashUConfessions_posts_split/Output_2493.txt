I confess that I hate Wash U. I really hate it. There are many aspects of my daily life that can be attributed to this school that make me feel perpetually miserable, and these are a mere few.

For one, I don't feel like I get along with most people here. Everyone seems to be too cutthroat and self-absorbed to bother wanting to extend friendships deeper than "what answer did you get for number four on the bio exam?!" I'm not really sure I have that many good friends.

Secondly, this school always makes me feel inadequate. I know it's an academically rigorous university and we all came to this school to be challenged, but this continues to be a hard pill for me to swallow. I do everything I can for an exam, but no matter how well I understand the course material, exams always seem to fly way over my head and I end up swinging a much lower grade than what I feel my understanding is. It's very frusturating.

I've tried changing my study habits, I've tried talking to my professors, and I keep thinking "next semester I'll like my classes more and do better in them" but I'm slowly convincing myself that that's never going to happen because, in my experience so far, it still hasn't.

As a sophomore, I thought this year was going to be different but it's turning out to be as exhausting and unfulfilling as last year. I've seriously considered transferring, but I'm too stubborn to let Wash U "win" per say. However, I always feel so miserable when I'm here and I just want to be happy again. Is it worth it to transfer junior year of college? Any tips for making Wash U more worthwhile? Because right now, for the sake of my own sanity, it doesn't seem to be...
