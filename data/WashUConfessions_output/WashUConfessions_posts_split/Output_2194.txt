I confess that as a senior I've never went to WILD. Well technically I went once stayed for 5 mins and left because the music was way too loud for me. I am pretty much aversive to loud music, wild party, alcohol, and the like. This has nothing to do with religious reasons...I'm not affiliated with any specific religion...I just don't like them. While I do want friends, I would much prefer socializing over a dinner or a movie, or go to an amusement park or cardinals games together, or even go to the gym or library together. Not sure whether that's why I basically have no friends. I feel that saying that I never drink and don't want anything alcoholic more than a small glass of wine in fancy meals for the foreseeable future would make people look at me as if they've seen a madman.
