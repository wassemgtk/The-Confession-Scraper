Response to recent flurry of GPA-themed posts:

Does GPA matter? Of course GPA matters. Rigorous coursework matters. Sleep matters. The tone you use with BD workers matters. The way you respond to friends going through hard times matters. The time you take to read the news in the morning matters. All of these things matter profoundly and so the question I think we should all be asking ourselves is not the extent to which things like GPA matter in our society, but how much we want them to matter in our own lives. Speaking as a senior with a good GPA and a nice post-grad job lined up, I often wonder whether I’d be happier if I had spent less of my energy on classroom performance and more energy actively engaging with other aspects of life. GPA certainly does factor into employability, but in terms of determining the worth of a person, it’s absolutely useless. I know people whom I respect very little with stellar GPAs and people whom I respect very much with mediocre numbers. A bad GPA shouldn’t stifle you—it should prompt you to think creatively about what you find interesting and exciting and what skills you possess that you can apply to that area of interest or passion beyond the strictures of classroom evaluation.
