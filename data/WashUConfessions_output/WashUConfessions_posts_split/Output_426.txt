I know I've gained weight but I'm afraid to step on the scale. I don't even know where I can find a scale. Over the summer I was working on weight control and I don't want to see that I've gained it all back.

I feel like I don't have time to work out. Or when I do have time, I'm too tired. I'm also afraid of going to the gym because I'm overweight. I don't want people to look at me and judge me. I know people on campus here are proud of being "fit".

I'm just a freshman who is having a really rough time getting my shit together.
