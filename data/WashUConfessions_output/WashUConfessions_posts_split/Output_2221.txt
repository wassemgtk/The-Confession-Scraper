Dear Large Corporate Business,

I am humbled and surprised that you are giving me the opportunity to interview for your internship. As an Arts & Sciences student with a non-quantitative-material-heavy major, I understand why you may have been hesitant. You have a sea of eager B-School students who have been preparing for your case interview since they emerged from the prenatal executive suite. As for me, I leisurely browsed CareerLink, kind of drunk and wearing boxers, and threw in an application because my mom said I should "probably get an internship next summer."

But alas, I think what you do is interesting, and I do want to work for you--and with some training (that you aptly offer in the "internship description"), I think I have what it takes. I may not have taken a math class here, but give me two angle measures of a triangle and I'll be damned if I can't find the third one. I may not know what a case interview is, but I will spend a lot of time preparing for one just in "case" you hire me. I am good at understanding people and communicating my ideas, and while my course of study might be unorthodox, it makes me DIFFERENT from the business majors and has given me a unique perspective that might end up being valuable to you.

Also, I will be studying abroad next semester, so if you offer me your internship this fall, I will be able to fuck around in Europe and not worry about this in the spring. So please, Large Corporate Business, take a chance on me. I promise I won't let you down.

Sincerely,
Liberal Arts Major
