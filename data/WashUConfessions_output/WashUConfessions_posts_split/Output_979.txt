Hey Confessions Admin. My name is Johnny Heo - you may know me, you may not. The following is a message I put out to my friends - I'd love for you to share it with the rest of WashU as well, if it so happens that you share the same ideals as I do. I hope to abandon the selfish life I've been living till now, and hope to use what I believe to be my talents, for the betterment of all people. I dabble here and there in producing and creating hip-hop. I'm nowhere near what you'd call "good";  I've made some waves in the past for performing/releasing my original work. However, the subject matter of all my songs were always about the same things you're apt to hear in most of hip-hop; girls, drugs, partying, money, etc.. I'm not okay with that anymore. Hopefully, the following blurb would better help you understand my dream.

I know you're unhappy - if not as a whole, then about something specific. I want you to tell me why. I want you to tell me what I can do to help. By comment, by private message, by text (248-885-6571).. In any way. Let me share in your struggles. No one deserves to fight the good fight alone. If not you, then someone you know. Pass it on.
Afterwards, if you so desire, I'd like to write a song about you. I'd like to show the world that you're more than your Facebook statuses, Instagram photos, college admissions essays, grades, occupations, etc. You're more than that to me - you're a human being, just like me.
This is all I can do for the world to make it a better place. It's not much, but it's all I can do.
I'll write the songs of your sorrow, so we can accomplish a better tomorrow.

Thank you,
Your friend & advocate,
Johnny
