When I was accosted by the slovenly set but otherwise kindly gentlemen for a couple bucks to get gas for his stalled car at the Shell station tonight at first I just ignored him. Then as I had a relatively good day and was feeling nice I gave him enough for a gallon of gas to get home or where ever he needed to go. After I watched him take a swig from some poorly wrapped container and continue to repeat the process many times over, I just drove off in disgust. Needless to say, no one is getting my money again. It's really sad that I feel like all the people that are constantly begging are just looking to hose everyone else where there are probably some that actually need help (both monetary and all ways possible) but I just don't want to take that risk anymore.
