This weekend I had an awesome conservation with the facilities staff. These are definitely the most underrated, but important parts of campus. These guys work at 1 in the morning and make our buildings looking as pristine as they are. So please, if you enjoyed your time here at Wash U and see one of them, give up a second of your time and say hi and thank you to them.
