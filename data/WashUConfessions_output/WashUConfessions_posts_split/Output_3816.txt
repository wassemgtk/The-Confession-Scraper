So I started doing this freshman year, and ever since it has become a habit/tradition...It all started when my roommate hooked up with the guy that I had been talking to exclusively, and who was so cute.  I was SOOOO angry.  I couldn't think straight. I ran into the bathroom, into the shower, grabbed her shampoo bottle, and went into the bathroom.  There I proceeded to diarrhea into the bottle a little bit, capped it, and returned it to the shower.  The days following were hilarious...my roommate would come out of the shower with her hair smelling like shit! (Shows her!)  Pretty soon the guy that I had a crush on got rid of her, and came back to me.  Now, whenever I get double crossed by a so-called friend, I pull the same maneuver I did that night freshman year.  My friends and I now call it the shampoopoo revenge, LOL!
