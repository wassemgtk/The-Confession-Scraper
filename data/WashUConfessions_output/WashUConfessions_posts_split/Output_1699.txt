The guy who commented on post 2117 is my grandpa hahaha. I liked the post so it must've shown up in his news feed and I think he may have the impression that I wrote it. ..which is especially funny because I'm no longer dating the boyfriend I told him about at Christmas soooo I should probably fill him in on that woops.
