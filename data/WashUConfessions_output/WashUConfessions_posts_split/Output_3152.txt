It makes me really happy when the statuses that get the most likes are the ones that are kind and good to people. The ones extending goodwill to Boston and those affected by the bombings, or making progress toward overcoming depression, or appreciating others in the WU community. Shows that even though a lot of what goes on here is fluff, we value real good in the world.
