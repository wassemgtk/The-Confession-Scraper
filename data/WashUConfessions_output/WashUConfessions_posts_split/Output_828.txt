I just want to say how much I love my department right now. I was so close to not coming back next semester but I opened up to people and they truly did help me out. I'm someone who doesn't believe I luck but today I really to feel like the luckiest person in the world. Thank you WashU! And people take chances!! The amount of no's I heard before someone finally said yes was daunting, but at the very least people do hear you out.
