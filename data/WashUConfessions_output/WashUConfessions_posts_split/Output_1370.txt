Whenever I pass one of the custodial/maintenance staff, I feel a little bad about myself. I was lucky enough to win a random lottery to be born into a home and economic circumstance that was focused on education and learning. I may be generalizing greatly, but I feel that some of these workers weren't given the opportunities that I was, and if they had, they could be in my place or better.

That's why when I see people making a mess/not cleaning up for themselves, it fucking pisses me off. Stop making a job that is already hard to do even harder. To be able to submit yourself to picking up after others is a type of humility and fortitude that I greatly admire. I don't know if it's out of elitism or pure willful ignorance, but people just don't care about what they have to do. How do you think they feel when they have to constantly clean up after a bunch of college students who act like 5 year olds? Yes, I understand that it's their job, but we could be doing a hell of a lot more to make it easier.  Just like an ER trauma surgeon would love to be less utilized, let's make these hardworking individuals' jobs less taxing.
