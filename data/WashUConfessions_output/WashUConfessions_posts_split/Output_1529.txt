It's day one of big little week and I already want to unfriend all my Facebook friends in sororities. All of these posts are the same, and it seems so disingenuous to talk about loving somebody based on small presents they gave you, especially when all of the gifts seem like they're the same. Why do you feel a need to post on Facebook immediately about this?
