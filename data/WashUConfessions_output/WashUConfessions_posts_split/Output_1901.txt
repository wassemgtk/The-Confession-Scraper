I recently need to begin planning for paying for my college tuition. I've been privileged enough to not need to pay for much previously myself, but because of recent events, I need to begin paying for tuition. I have no idea how to begin and if anyone had any tips, that'd be greatly appreciated. I'm so stressed out and not sure even where to begin. I don't want to sound conceited or arrogant when saying I don't know how to pay for something like tuition because I've never had to but it's true so I need all the help I can get. Any pointers or tips is greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance!
