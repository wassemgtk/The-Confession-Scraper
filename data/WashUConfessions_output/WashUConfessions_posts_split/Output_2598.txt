s alright with you guys, I need to hold off on confessions for a bit until later tonight. This deserves proper attention. 

Lately there have been a number of incoming submissions related to depression and suicide. I wanted to put out a reminder that talking to a trained professional could help tremendously. Depression isn't something that someone can just "get over", and it isn't a choice - but help is available. 

There are resources both on and off campus for mental health counseling. Uncle Joe's offers Peer Counseling on campus - they're available to undergrads 24/7, and can be reached at 314-935-5099. Life Crisis Services provided by Provident Inc (http://www.providentstl.org/Services/LifeCrisis.aspx) could also be a good resource to use - they're available 24/7 and can be reached at 314-647-4357. 

To be clear, I will not be censoring posts because of this. Everyone deserves a voice, especially those in crisis or who have thoughts that could make others uneasy. I will not be suppressing them, and I think it's important for people to realize that they are not alone.
 
But I'm hoping that reminding people of these resources can make a difference. And a big thank you to everyone who has been encouraging those who are struggling to seek help.
