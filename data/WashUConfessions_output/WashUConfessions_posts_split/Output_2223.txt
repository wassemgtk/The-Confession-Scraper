I regret choosing Wash U. My major here is not exactly one of the school's flagship departments, and to be honest a lot of the courses have been taught awfully. No, I'm not using bad teaching as an excuse for bad grades because at risk of sounding arrogant I don't need to; my grades have been quite good. What frustrates me is that I could have gone to my home state's main public university, saved my parents tens of thousands of dollars, and gotten a computer science degree that was just as if not more competent than the one I'm working on here. 

Unfortunately I didn't know that I would want to study this major when I was going into college, and, like the dumbass that I am, just chose the most "prestigious" school that I got into.  Obviously Wash U is a great place to be, and I'm very grateful for the opportunity my family has given me by getting me here financially. Given the chance though, I would go back and choose differently in a heartbeat. Hindsight really is 20/20.
