I have very little work ethic, compared to most others at WashU. I think I am pretty aspiring... I'm a science major who wants to go to graduate school. But I'm mostly a C student, and I cant help but feel like I'm a disappointment to a lot of people. I can't seem to motivate myself to study as hard as I should-- not even a little bit. I feel like a failure. I don't know what to do.
