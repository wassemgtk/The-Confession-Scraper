I confess that I am pretty put off by the moral standards of the administration at WashU. I recently graduated and was never really involved in any of the social justice or activist issues on campus, but I followed along. I was absolutely repulsed by such actions like the Chancellor's disrespectful email to the head of the NAACP last semester (I know there is a link to it somewhere), the dismissal of need-blind application processes and our low number of Pell Grants, and the fact that we are consistently brought up in conversations about inequality at elite institutions. I know people will say that the administration runs the school like a business, it's their job, but at what point to we sacrifice basic decency and justice for the sake of higher US News and World Report rankings? It just makes me feel really helpless because I know that even if I did get involved in social justice efforts as a student, all they'd have to do is wait a few years for me to graduate.
