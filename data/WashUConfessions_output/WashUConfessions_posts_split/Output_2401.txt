Honestly I'm kind of fed up with all of this stuff about consent, alcohol, and rape. I definitely think sexual assault is still a huge problem on campuses across the country, but when I hear people here say that "you can't give consent under the influence of alcohol, and therefore that's rape" it makes me question the credibility of everything else you say. A sober or buzzed guy taking advantage of a clearly hammered girl is obviously a predatory, aggressive act. But if two people are drunk at a party and go back and have sex, and one of them regrets it the next morning, that's not rape. Do people not realize that if we say alcohol=no consent=rape, then 90% of sexual activity in college would be considered rape?
