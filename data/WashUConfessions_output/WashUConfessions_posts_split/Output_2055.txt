I confess that the white shaming and "check your privilege" attitude on campus (plus what I've seen on this confessions page) have made me a little paranoid. I kind of get the feeling that most non-white students here at Wash U assume I'm racist before they even know anything about me. Which, when you think about it, is kind of racist in itself, isn't it? And it's the opposite of what they're trying to promote so it's not really helping anyone.
