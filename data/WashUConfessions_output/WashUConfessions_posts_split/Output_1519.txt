I have PTSD and no one knows. I'm the happiest person you know, but some days I wake up and want to die. I say this for two reasons. First, even if someone seems happy, treat them well. Treat everyone well. We all have our struggles. Second, is there a support group for people like me? No one gets it. You can try and empathize, but until you feel the panic attaches and have the sudden, uncontrollable flashbacks, you cannot truly understand.
