I thought this place is called Wash U CONFESSIONS. We confess here things that we don't want to say elsewhere and the anonymity is a big part of that. I am always fascinated by how people get so upset here when they see something they don't approve. Why do you even care? Why do you even take the time to judge people? You don't like it, fine then just don't follow it. This place is meant for people to lash out, so nothing but the honest thought should be invited. Next time before you judge so quickly and even take screenshots of the post so you can invite more judgement from your facebook friends, think about it. Maybe it's exactly that kind of attitude of yours that push people to confess here. Are you telling me that you don't have dark thoughts that other people might not approve?
