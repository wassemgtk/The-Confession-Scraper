I have multiple learning disabilities and as a result I have a tremendous difficulty reading and (sometimes) writing. I am able to cope fairly well with these disabilities as a part of my own reality, but the more stressed out I get, the more affected I am by my disabilities. It's gotten to the point before where I can't physically read words on a page. My friends often (without intention of harm) make fun of me for my reading, spelling, and speaking abilities when I slip.

I'm writing this post because most people assume that if you're attending a school like Wash U you're well prepared and intelligent, which means physically reading and writing come naturally. I'm guessing it's very hard for some people to understand how emotionally and mentally straining it is for many people with learning disabilities (especially those who don't have access to resources) to deal with academic pressures when it's sometimes so difficult to translate the medium which information and concepts are being presented though.

I can't tell you how many times fellow students, teachers, and even professors have labeled me as lazy or apathetic because I didn't finish my readings or essays. The truth is, sometimes I can't finish my work; sometimes I can't understand the letters staring at me as words; sometimes I can't speak coherently; and sometimes I can't express my most complex and most simple thoughts properly. It's important to be respectful of all people's thought processes. Never dismiss somebody's disabilities because of their intelligence or achievements.
