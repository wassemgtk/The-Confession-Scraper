You know that you are f**ked for sure when you realize that it is too late to change major. I am a junior BME and I deeply regret not dropping BME 140 when Dr. Yin made me derive Goldman equation. Maybe he was right about scaring off freshmen. This is almost like ctrl+c does not work in Unix when I am in a wild while loop. I feel like the only way to stop this miserable loop of torture is by plugging off power source, for once and for all.
