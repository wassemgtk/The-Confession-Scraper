When I was little I had what my parents considered an "unhealthy obsession" with facial hair. I wanted a full bushy pirate beard. When other little girls had rainbows painted on their cheeks, I had beards. By the time I was ten, they thought I had gotten over it. I never got over it. I find myself most attracted to men with beards and facial hair. I love stroking them. I'll say it - I'm a beard lover. Come at me hairy men.
