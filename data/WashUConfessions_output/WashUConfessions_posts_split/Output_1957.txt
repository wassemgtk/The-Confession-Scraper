I came into WashU driven by a curiosity to understand. I'm a senior majoring in science and math working my way through finals and graduate school applications. I probably just bombed some of my finals but honestly I don't give a damn and that scares me. People will probably say "oh, that's fine, grades don't matter anyway." Yeah true, but isn't that messed up?

I've done research and I LOVE research. My research group here is amazing and I did an internship over the summer which I loved too. Just because of those experiences, I'm still shooting for a Ph.D and a career in academia. If I had only taken classes or had bad research experiences then I would definitely be going for industry right now. Classes need to be restructured. All they are teaching me is stuff I don't care about because I don't know why the stuff is important. Half of my professors literally lecture straight from the book. I could read the damn book faster than they lecture and finish a semester in 3 weeks. But that should not be the only purpose of classes. I feel like professors are just shoving information down my brain not bothering to explain it's importance or how it relates to work being done today. I get that there are intro classes which will be boring but upper-level classes really should involve some creativity and research.

If the goal of classes is to further an education then just having me memorize some random information is not furthering that goal. I need to understand how that information is useful and what kinds of problems still need to be solved. People should be able to say that grades DO matter because it reflects a real genuine ability to think through problems and solve new ones, not just memorize a couple of methods and then apply them to a very narrow subset of problems that you will see on an exam.

I also tutor here. It scares the hell out of me when people ask questions like "do I need to know this for the exam?" or "can you just tell me what's on the exam?" because they are missing the point of classes. But I have to confess, I think the same way too and that really scares me....I feel like everyone (professors and tutors included) are missing the point of a real education and that needs to change.
