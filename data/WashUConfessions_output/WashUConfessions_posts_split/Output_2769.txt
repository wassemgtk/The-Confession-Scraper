All of the guys that I'm friends with always end up developing feelings for me. And can I just say it's really not all that fun. It is really emotionally draining to have to hurt so many feelings and tiring to have to deal with so many awkward situations. The guys I just want to be friends with always want more, but the guys I want to date don't even know that I exist. I've never even had a boyfriend. When you are lonely and receiving so much attention at the same time, you make bad decisions and settle for the best you can get. You're not happy just casually hooking up with a friend and you feel bad for leading someone else on. In the end, friends turn into people you awkwardly avoid eye contact with in bd. I'm starting to think it's true that heterosexual men and women can't have a true friendship.
