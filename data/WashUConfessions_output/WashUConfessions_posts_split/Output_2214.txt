I confess that whenever someone laughs at me for saying that the B school is hard  I get slightly depressed. Their comments about "B-School Pre-School" etc. have really started to get to me. When people say things like this I cannot help bur question my own abilities. I'm struggling in the B school. I think that it's difficult. By saying that it's a slacker major, it makes me feel like I'm not even close to being as smart as any of the pre-med or engineering students. I'm not in the B school because I heard that it was easy. I'm in it because it's something that I am truly interested in and passionate about. I hate being told that the B school is easy because it makes me feel dumb for not even being able to do well there. Why should other people be able to tell me whether or not my major (my future career) is a "real subject"?
