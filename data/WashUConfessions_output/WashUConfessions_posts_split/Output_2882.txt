I'm truly in awe of the Wash U community for its support and strength. While I agree that members of our community can be hurtful and ignorant at times, our ENTIRE community, students and faculty alike, go out of their way to support and appreciate one another in so many circumstances. Those qualities are worth recognizing and discussing too.
