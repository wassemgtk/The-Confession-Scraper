When I see a girl I like dressing trashily and heading out to parties drunk, I can't help but stop liking her and think instead about how she'll hook up with some stranger that night. I wish I could find a girl who spend time in an actual relationship and not at some bar ready to fuck some dude she just met. Maybe it's my imagination running, but sometimes it feels like everyone's just hooking up and nobody wants anything meaningful.
