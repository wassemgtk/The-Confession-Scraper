Honestly, I regret working so hard in life. I worked my way out of a shitty school district to WashU, found myself completely behind everyone else in terms of academics, did horribly my first semester, and then worked hard enough to get into the top 10-20% of GPA's in the b-school.

Now is the moment of truth, where the junior internships come rolling in. Now, I'm realizing that I'm going to get nothing. The charismatic, popular kids are going to get all of the internships that I want and I'm getting none of them.

I'm realizing that I could have just breezed through high school, gotten into a random state school, had a lot of fun, and been in the same situation.
