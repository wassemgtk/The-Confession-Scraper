I've submitted a couple drug related confessions that haven't gone through so I'll try again. I like drugs a lot and think it'd be cooler if WashU had a better drug scene--the way it is now to get high quality, decently priced drugs you gotta be on some Pablo Escobar shit. When I offhandedly mention to some people how I smoked the fattest Joint yesterday they look at me like I'm some kind of criminal.

But for real I think WashU should stand up to the administration/WUPD's unnecessarily punitive substance policies that are really just relics of failed War on Drugs era thinking. Why should someone feel safer pounding 8 shots of Smirnoff in their room than ripping a bowl? I've done both many times and only one has landed me at the hospital. If WashU is going to sanction alcohol use, it's ridiculous to criminalize weed like they do. Yet I feel like most people would think I'm some kind of junkie freak if I said that publicly.
