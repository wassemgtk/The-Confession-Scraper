Yesterday, I decided to forsake WILD and have some alone time. I grabbed dinner at Fitz's and all went well. Then, before I was about to leave, a man carrying a pitcher a beer for his friends approached me asking why I wasn't with some "fine b****es." I laughed it off nervously, hoping that he would leave while not trying to insult him. He left, only to come back later to pursue the topic again. I then provided a false excuse: I had a girlfriend at home. With that, he tried to make a half-moral by saying that I should keep my options open career-wise, but then added that I should do the same with women.

Now, mind you, I was not offended by anyway. If any, I probably felt a little more conscious about my status as a single, heterosexual male, but other than that, I'm fine. However, I just wanted to inquire the Wash U community on one thing: Is being in a relationship so imbued in our culture (US moreso) that being seen alone in a restaurant or movies is seen as an anomaly or an affront to your masculinity/femininity? Once again, I'm not hurt in any way, and I don't have a problem with friends; I just wanted to know the general opinion about this issue (if it is one).
