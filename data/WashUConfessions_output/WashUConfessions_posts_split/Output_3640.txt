Wash U has officially given me an inferiority complex. Not only do i feel like everyone here is so much smarter than me, but everyone also seems to have their lives planned out. It's either "I've known I've wanted to be a doctor since age 5" or "I'm destined to be the next CEO of Zappos" or "I've been working my whole life to be an NCAA champion" or "I started constructing automated robots before I could even walk." I'm so proud to call myself a Wash U student because of the incredible intellectuals I'm surrounded by every day, but sometimes I feel so suffocated by all of these smarty-pants....Seriously, Mr. "I'm-Majoring-in-Neuroscience-and-Mechanical-Engineering-and-Getting-a-minor-in-music-because-I-play-5-different-instruments"...like, I'm really happy that you're so good at life, I really am, and it's great that you're working so hard. But sometimes, I just want to punch a hole through a wall because of you.
