I just got cut from my last fraternity and feel shittier than ever. Last semester I didn't have the greatest time and never really found any friends that I really viewed as ones I wanted to keep for the long term. I kept telling myself that everything would be different next semester once I was in a fraternity. It's not that I'm an antisocial or weird guy. I'm just very selective of the people I enjoy hanging out with and it takes a lot for me to truly connect with someone. I went to events for almost every fraternity on campus but never really fell in love with any of them or viewed them as guys I would want to be friends with for the rest of college. Still, I narrowed down to my three favorites and I tried my hardest to connect with as many brothers as I could but in the end I guess they didn't see me as a great fit. I'm not even upset about not getting bids but I'm just starting to worry that my niche at WashU just doesn't exist.
