When I was young, maybe six or seven years old, my aunt used to touch my penis. She said that it was okay because we're close, and that I was a good boy. At the time I was too much of a "good boy" to say no to my own aunt. Only later did I understand that I had been molested.

That was more than a decade ago, and the memory faded away quite a lot, but it still feels like a rock is sitting inside my chest every time I think of her. I wonder if she remembers her deeds.
