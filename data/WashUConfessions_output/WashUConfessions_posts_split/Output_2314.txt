Okay. Honest question that I'd be eviscerated for asking anyone in person.
The death of Mike Brown was obviously an unwarranted tragedy. But why are there campus protests for the death of Vonderrit Myers? He clearly wasn't innocent.
It's hard to preach that "all lives matter" when you choose a gun-wielding, life-threatening felon as your martyr, especially when there are no protests for the dozens of innocent black men killed every week.
