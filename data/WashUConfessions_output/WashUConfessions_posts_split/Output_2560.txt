I'm a senior. I am involved in Greek life - both a social and a professional fraternity. I'm also involved in various groups around campus.

Looking back on the past few years, I can confidently say that the best friends I have ever made and will ever make were in high school. I love all of my fraternity brothers, but I don't see them as the ones that are going to be at my wedding. Those will without doubt be my best friends from high school. My friends at Wash U were people to drink with and party with, but my friends back home are the ones who I really grew up around. We have helped each other through hard times and are always together for the good times. That, to me, is what lifelong friends are.

Does anyone else here agree?
