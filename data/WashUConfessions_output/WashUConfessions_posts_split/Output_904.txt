When I saw confession #2296, I wanted to comment so badly, but was also worried about the stigma. All I can say as someone who's had herpes for a year now is that the stigma is truly the worst of it. The first outbreak is awful, but after then you'll probably get them very infrequently if at all and they will be much less severe. I was devastated when I found out last year. I felt dirty and thought that I would never get to be intimate or to be in a relationship again (not true).

But honestly - this whole thing is ridiculous. The majority of people have the herpes virus but have it associated with their mouth. If you've ever gotten a coldsore, you could give someone that same virus down below when you give them oral. That's how I got it. It's illogical and unfair that there is such a stigma against literally a rash that is unlikely to come back frequently or strongly after its first expression and doesn't involve serious health problems. You  will be fine, your vagina/penis/whatever will be fine. You are still desirable and you are still a great person worthy of respect and dignity. Fuck people who judge or make fun. I'm still trying to overcome the stigma, but I don't feel dirty anymore, and HSV doesn't bother me anymore than the possibility of getting a cold (actually tbh after the first expression its much less shitty than a cold). 

What most helped me understand and come to terms with all of this were youtube videos by the TheSexUneducated. To anyone struggling with this now, or to anyone who's willing to listen and empathize, check them out. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YQzGV0xIFc.
