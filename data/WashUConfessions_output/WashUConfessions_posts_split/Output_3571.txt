I think this whole thing is very ironic. WashU has taken a noticeable stricter/funsucking approach toward fraternities this year to prevent an event that would cause lots of negative publicity. Now a somewhat minor event such as tuesday night in bears den (rapping the true lyrics of a song, near black people, despite the N-word, is minor compared to hazing deaths) gets blown up by WashU and they get the all the negative media attention they were trying to prevent. These guys should be punished because what they did was stupid but this school needs to chill out.
