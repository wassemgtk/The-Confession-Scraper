I don't really understand the whole push for the gov to pick up our tuition bills that people are making on here. Frankly, if my parents weren't helping, I would have just gone to a state school. There is absolutely zero "need" to be here. No one at Washu "needs" to be at Washu. Simple fact. Frankly, the whole national push for everyone to be going to college at all is enormously overrated. Millions of people our age are getting scammed into getting crappy degrees from crappy schools in order to get crappy jobs that pay crappy salaries lower than what they could make coming out of trade school. I know this for a fact, given that I was raised by a blue collar family.

Also, if the government were to ever start subsidizing college education, they should absolutely be allowed to specify certain majors. If my tax dollars are going to help someone get a college degree, it had better be STEM; there is no way I'm helping to subsidize someone's humanities degree. If you want one of those (note that I'm excluding business here), you should be on your own. A humanities degree is a luxury item; if we start subsidizing those, the gov should also start picking up the tab on the beer I have with dinner every night. What a ridiculous notion that society should pay for you to learn whatever you want, regardless of the future utility of that degree to society.

Last but not least, a few people on here-in response to the comments about high tuition-have suggested a student strike on classes. Genius. Stick it to the man by skipping the lectures you already paid for. That way, you'll have high tuition, but you'll also know less and be less likely to get a job that would help you pay off your loans. Absolutely genius. Believe me, I understand the desire to skip class, especially on these cold mornings, but is that actually how anyone here thinks they will be able to stick it to the school?
