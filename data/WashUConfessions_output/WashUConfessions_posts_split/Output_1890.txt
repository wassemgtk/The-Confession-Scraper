Question to the admin: have you ever posted your own confessions?

Yeap! When people were complaining that the confessions were getting depressing, I tried to think of something funny and relevant to lighten up the mood. I admit that I wrote this one:

I've also posted a more serious confession way earlier on in the year, but that's a different story. Looking back, it's weird how much my life has changed since I took over in September and it's hard to believe I wrote it.
