I'm a prefrosh, and the posts on here scare the hell out of me. I chose WashU because it seemed like such a nurturing, wonderfully inviting, and happy environment. Is this all a pretense? Why is this page so negative? Although I had amazing offers other schools, I felt like WUSTL was the right choice for me, especially with a full-ride. But the posts on here are really making me question my decision...too late to turn back now lol
