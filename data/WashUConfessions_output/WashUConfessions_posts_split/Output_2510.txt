I confess that it seems as though people just aren't as interested in getting to know me junior year. Maybe people already have their groups of friends, maybe it's that I changed a lot during the summer, or maybe I just have fewer social interactions now that I live off campus, but it really seems like people smile for that first minute of conversation, and then can't even summon up the effort to pretend they give a crap about getting to know me.
