Maybe Dining Services doesn't necessarily have anything to do with this, but I have noticed that there has been less and less crab meat in the sushi (more cucumbers and avocados), and blueberries are nonexistent in the yogurt parfaits. Another sneaky strategy to sell us food for more than it's actually worth? I most definitely think so.
