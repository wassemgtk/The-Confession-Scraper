I live off campus.  I was near my apartment building in the middle of the day, and a guy (looked like he was a student, or at least was student-aged) came up to me and said very politely, "Excuse me, do you live in these buildings?" I curtly replied, "Why?"  He looked startled but said, "Do you know this person?" and held out a (presumably dropped) wallet with a drivers license. I said, again curtly, "No, I don't know any of my neighbors."

Whoever you were, I'm sorry if I came across as rude/abrupt/angry.  As a female, I'm always super guarded and uptight when addressed by unknown people in public, especially if they're male, no matter how good their intentions seem (and realistically, probably are).  My behavior is probably irrational to a degree, but I as well as my family/friends/peers have had enough close calls with random people (the majority have been with men, but women certainly aren't innocent either) that that's just how I behave.  I wish it could be not that way, and that creepy people didn't exist, and that everyone could be trusted, but I guess we're all products of our surroundings in a lot of ways and it's better to be safe than sorry.

My main point isn't to explain/justify how I act, but to say to the guy who I assume was being good samaritan and trying to find the owner of the wallet: If you happen read this, thank you for doing the right thing and don't be put off from doing good by one crotchety person who rains on the parade.

(Also, if you lost your wallet in the Kingsbury/Washington Avenue/Melville/Kingsland area on/before February 19 around 4:30pm, the last name on the ID began with an M and looked eastern European and I *think* the first name was Michael.)
