Ok, I know I'm not supposed to ask questions here but I'm getting desperate. How exactly do I find people to date and/or hook up with? I promised myself I would lose my virginity by the end of the year by any (legal and non destructive) means necessary, but it's not happening. People tell me I'm fairly attractive so I don't think it's that, and I can fake being confident when I need to. I just need to find a way to get in the door. I've tried clubs but I don't really like any of the clubs here. Would you recommend Tinder? Most people I've talked to said it sucks. I'm 100% serious.
