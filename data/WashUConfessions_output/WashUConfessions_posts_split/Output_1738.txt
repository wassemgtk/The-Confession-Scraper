I'm a guy and I just bought some pepper spray off of Amazon. For some reason I have started to have some irrational fear that I will be mugged while walking off campus, and I don't care if you make fun of me for it- it's self defense and just because I'm a guy shouldn't mean I have to be muscular/fit enough to defend myself with just my hands.
