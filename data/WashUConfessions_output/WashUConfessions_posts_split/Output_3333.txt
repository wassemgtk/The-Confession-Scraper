Since early last fall, I've been spiraling down faster and faster into what I know is depression. I can't focus, my appetite's shit, I don't enjoy anything, I can't sleep like a normal human being, and my moods swing like the f****** heart monitor of a rabbit in a minefield. Yet, I STILL will not go to SHS... So many people have told me about horrible experiences there that I can't trust them with my mental health, even though, at this point, I can't trust myself either.
