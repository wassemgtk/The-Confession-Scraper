I confess that the chansellor's email was the most see-through attempt at trying to show a group of people that he supports them...like seriously? Isn't it your job to be good at showing that you genuinely care about a cause rather than trying to gain support by ambiguously slandering the few places in the world where people can speak freely and have genuine discussions. At least TRY to act like you actually care.
