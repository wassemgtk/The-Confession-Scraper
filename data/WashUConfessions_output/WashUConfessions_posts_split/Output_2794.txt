To the girl who broke my heart....Good luck finding someone to care about you like I did again. It kills me that we ended the way we did, and I feel like i'm dying inside everyday I don't have you. It doesn't matter if you were drunk, or if was only a kiss or whatever. Cheating is cheating. Everyone should remember that.
