I'm a heterosexual male...Is it racist that I don't find Asian girls attractive? I try to be tolerant and accepting of everyone, and I really have nothing against any racial group, it's just that I simply am not sexually attracted to Asian girls. I feel kind of bad about it, like I'm being offensive and discriminatory. I'd appreciate it if someone could give their input. Feel free to say I'm a racist if you think that; it's fine, I just want to know. Also I apologise sincerely if this offends anyone; that was in no way my intent. Thanks.
