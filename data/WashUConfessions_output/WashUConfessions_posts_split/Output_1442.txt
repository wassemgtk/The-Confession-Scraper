I confess that my faith in WashU has been restored.

I guess you've all seen the "Love is..." campaign outside Olin. The idea is to complete the sentence with whatever you think love is, using the blank post-its on the wall.

My sentence was: "Love is my new dildo." So I wrote "My New Dildo" on one of the post-its on the wall. A couple days later, my post-it note was taken away, leaving a blank square on the wall where it used to peacefully hang.

Today, there is a new pink post-it note saying "my dildo" right where my gracious expression of love used to dwell. Whoever did this, I love you. Love is you, baybey.
