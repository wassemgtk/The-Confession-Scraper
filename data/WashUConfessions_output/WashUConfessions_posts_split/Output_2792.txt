I'm a female with normal weight but probably the most abnormal shape ever. I can fit into any XS shirt/T-shirt etc nicely but it's hell of a trouble to even find one single pair of trousers that looks good on me. I'm 5'6" and a lot of people don't believe on that because my shape makes me look shorter than I actually am. When I'm exercising people would peek, look, stare at me because fat is hanging around my thighs and shaking as I run/jump. I once did a physical exam before working with a trainer and she was astonished with my body fat percentage. "This is sky high for someone of your age, especially considering that you don't look like that (I was in a long-ish short/skirt that day)". The guy I like once played basketball with me and after half an hour he was super annoyed and told me on our way back that he will never play with me again because I look so clumsy and uncoordinated that he feels ashamed just to stand in the same court as I do. Okay I've had enough people telling me that they are not nice and love your body and stuff but to be honest I'm fed up with this love your body shit. Can we stop those politically rhetoric and face the reality? The reality is the hotter the girl is the more popular she gets, and the better chance she gets anything she wants in her life. See how rare cute guys hold hand with a fat girl/woman on the street. See how many likes a hot vs. fat girl gets on her Facebook. See how being hot automatically solves a bunch of interpersonal problem while being fat is an invitation for people to find fault with you. I don't say this attitude is correct but that's the reality. I've probably went through all diagnosis under DSM-V eating disorders in the past two years or so although I've never been formally diagnosed because I refuse to see a therapist as I don't want them to tell me being super concerned about weight and shape is wrong. I've probably read more books and papers on eating disorders than a clinical psychology grad student. I know solution to my problem is never extreme dieting but to eat well and exercise and I know dieting does not give me what I want (dieting makes you thinner in the place that you burn fat first - a place which you are prob already satisfied with) but resorting to food just seems an easy escape. I don't even know what my point is in writing this. I guess I'm just super disoriented.
