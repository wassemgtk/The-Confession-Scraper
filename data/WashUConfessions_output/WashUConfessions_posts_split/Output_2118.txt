I'm a male student who frequently skips 2 meals a day. Usually I'll have a small snack like a granola bar for breakfast and then I'll make something like pasta later on at night. I eat a lot of pasta because it's something I can save money on by making a few nights' worth at once. I would like to eat more often, but I simply can't afford it. Driving is not an option, and taking the bus to the grocery store there and back is time I really don't have. I figure I'm definitely not getting all the nutrients I need, but I'm really surprised how well my body has adjusted to my new "diet". I lost a bit of weight which I gained over the summer, and I definitely enjoy my dinner much more. This has made me really appreciate what I have, and I recognize a lot more clearly what it means to have food on the table.
