I confess that now that I've graduated WashU, I appreciate my experience more than I thought I would. I definitely had my ups and downs at WashU (thanks for the low GPA), but overall, I have to say it was definitely worth it. I learned a lot about myself, met great professors, and made some amazing friends. Thanks WashU!
