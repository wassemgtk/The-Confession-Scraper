I can't stand it when people order food or ask for things from the Dining Staff without saying please and thank you. I think that everyone needs to experience working in fast food or restaurants at least once in their lives to realize what it's like to be bossed around and disregarded from the other side. A little courtesy goes such a long way, and at the very least you're making someone's day a little better by making them feel appreciated. And hell, at the most, some of them might hook you up with some extra food in that half and half.
