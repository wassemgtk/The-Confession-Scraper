Wash U is becoming tyrannical in its green policies. The latest example is SPB. Why don't you bother getting some good talent for WILD instead of spending time and resources on making it "wholly compostable." (i.e. Why don't you do your fucking job and THEN worry about the tertiary agenda items?) No wonder CS40 is so much better than SU as a whole.
