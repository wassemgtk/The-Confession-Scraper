Mad respect to post #2162. I've worked in a restaurant that accepts Bear Bucks for almost two years. The attitude towards Wash U is SO bad that I've stopped admitting to new coworkers that I'm a member of the Wash U community, and the experience has made me tragically cynical towards my fellow students. Wash U kids are notorious for being difficult, and you can always count on them to tip for shit--if they tip at all.
But here's where it gets bad: when I try to make pleasant conversation with Wash U customers about us going to the same damn school, I'm typically met with bemusement and condescension, like they just can't believe that one of their own works in the service industry. I guess it just really sucks, because going to Wash U should be a source of pride. Not embarrassment.
