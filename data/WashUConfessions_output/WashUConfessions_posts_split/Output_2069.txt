I confess that I hate the concept of White Privilege. It's just fucking stupid.

Why would you describe the suffering of one group of people by shaming another group for not having gone through that suffering.
Every time I see people post about White Privilege, or Male Privilege I just wonder what the fuck I am supposed to do as a white dude. Am I supposed to feel bad for being born a white man, am I a worse person now? I sure fucking hope not.

It seems like a culture has risen recently that says fight fire with fire instead of put the fire out. Instead of saying "don't be racist" and "don't be sexist", I hear people say "all white people are lucky to be white, all men have it easy, they're privileged".

You can let people know that racism, sexism, and all other forms of discrimination exist without shaming them for not having suffered the discrimination themselves. Stop ostracizing white men, its destructive to progress.
