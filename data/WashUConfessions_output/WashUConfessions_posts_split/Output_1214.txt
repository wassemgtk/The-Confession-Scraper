Trigger Warning: sexual assault/rape
Some of my friends will probably know this is me when they read this, but that’s ok because I feel like what I have to say is important and needs to be seen by those who are maybe going through something similar.

Tonight was “Take Back the Night” and I didn’t attend. I fully support the event and I think it is incredibly empowering and uplifting and I hope to attend next year. I didn’t attend because not too long ago I was the victim of rape. I’ve been debating whether or not to go to TBTN for about a week now and earlier tonight when someone asked me why I wasn’t going, the first thought that popped into my head was “it’s too soon. I can’t go. I can’t talk about rape right now.”

And that was actually the first time I admitted to myself that what had happened to me WAS rape. Since it’s happened I’ve been labeling and relabeling it. A “mistake” or “my fault” or “if only I hadn’t had so much to drink” or “well, it was something I had thought might happen earlier in the night”. I have spent my college career educating myself on sexual assault and had considered myself well versed and armed against these feelings that have now been in my mind and in my body since it happened.

I blacked out and had sex with someone I barely knew and they were sober. I woke up the next day alone, trying to piece together the events of the night before and realized that the little I knew caused my crippling anxiety and horror. But I immediately started trying to explain it away and I internalized the blame. I joked about what had happened with some friends, hoping that would ease the tension I was feeling. But as the days passed and my anxiety didn’t abate I was forced to come to terms with the fact that something wrong had happened to me. The hardest part about this whole thing has been learning to forgive myself. I’m trying to piece together how to get over it, how to not resent myself forever. I did not ask for, or deserve, what happened to me. I was raped. Earlier today when I admitted it to myself it gave me chills and I broke down and I want to curl into a ball and stay in bed but that’s not an option. I feel like admitting that this is what happened is the first step on the road to being ok again. Or, at least I hope it is.

Anyway, even if this doesn’t get published I needed to write it down somewhere. I need to know I’m not crazy; I need to know that I didn’t do this to myself. Someone else did this to me. It is not my fault.

It is not my fault.
