I wish some of the people studying at Olin would be more considerate towards others. For the most part, people do tend to stay quiet and respectful but there are always several individuals who decide to come to the library to study with their friends and end up socializing in large open areas where others are trying to study. Although there are other libraries and areas on campus where one could go to find a quiet study spot, I dont think we should inhibit an individual's privilege to study where they find themselves most productive just because they don't explicitly ask you to be quieter. It's just something to keep in mind because we have all been guilty of this at some point, but just may or may not already be aware of it.
