I don't think I'm technically depressed, but I'm never happy and I always feel apathetic. I don't think I'm technically suicidal because I'm too squeamish to self-harm and too anxious to do anything else along those lines, but I would be fine if something bad happened to me or if I just kind of evaporated into thin air one day.

I don't know what to do. I know how extremely serious depression and anxiety disorders are and I don't want to trivialize them because I don't think I exhibit symptoms anywhere near the magnitude of a mood disorder. As a result, I'm reluctant to ask for professional help or even to use a service like Uncle Joe's because maybe I'm simply being dramatic. I'm not even sure what, exactly, I expected from submitting this confession. It's just that if I went to bed one day and never woke up and never had to deal with the fact that I might legitimately fail one of my classes this semester and that I'm pretty sure all my friends actually hate me, I'd be fine. And that thought scares me.

I guess my confession is that I wish that I had just one real friend here who I could actually talk to. I also wish that people could stop studying for just two minutes and realize how much everyone around them is struggling too.
