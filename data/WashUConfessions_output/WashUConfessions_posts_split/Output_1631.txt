So for about a year now I've been bulimic.  I've mentioned it off handedly to strangers and told my doctor but no one I care about knows and I'm certainly not going to tell them. I feel more ashamed of it because I'm more than a little overweight. The few people I have mentioned it to react like this is just me being too lazy or stupid to lose weight in an acceptable form, but I'm not actually trying to lose weight. It started as a way to relieve stress when I got too many butterflies, and now I've gotten to start binge eating and purging. It's pretty gross, but I feel like it's just gonna be a part of me until I graduate eventually.
