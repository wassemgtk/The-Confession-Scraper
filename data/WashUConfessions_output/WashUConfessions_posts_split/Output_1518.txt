I confess that for just one year I want the university to cut all funding for student groups, social activities, landscaping, etc - basically anything that is non-essential to basic academics - and use that money to build a network of underground tunnels connecting all the buildings on campus. I would gladly give up social programs in exchange for never having to walk outside in this cold weather again. It will make my remaining winters in St. Louis so much more bearable and I think future students would be extremely grateful.
