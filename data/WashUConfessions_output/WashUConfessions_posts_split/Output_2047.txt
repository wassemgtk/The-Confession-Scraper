I didn't rush freshman year because I wasn't ready and sophomore year I was hoping to make RA (I didn't). Now, as  a Junior I know it wouldn't be socially acceptable to rush and I probably wouldn't get in the sorority I want, but I feel like I'm missing out on a college experience that I'll never be able to do again.
