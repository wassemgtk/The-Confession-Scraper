To the activists of WashU:

I confess that I would appreciate it if you would please stop yelling. You have every right to your opinions, but do not try to drag in those of us who are not interested.  I would ask you to look at what progress you have made.  On campus, any progress has been minimal, and clearly there is a significant apathetic crowd if previous posts are anything to go by (or look at the Peabody movement, or rather the lack thereof).  It is understandable to want to change the way things are, and I am by no means saying that you shouldn't do that.  I'm just saying you won't do it in college.  If you want to change anyone's mind or actually communicate in a meaningful way to people who have the ability to change things, then put in the time now to be in that position later in life; be realistic with what you can actually accomplish now.  Go to law school, or become a lobbyist, or learn marketing strategies so you can help a rally or something.

I appreciate the sentiment, but you are doing both us and your cause no good by trying to stir this up right now.  Whether we agree on this or not is irrelevant, as we are not in the position to make any sort of meaningful change.  You could say that we will eventually be, but who is to say that a facebook post is going to stick (hypocritical, I know), and who says it won't make things worse, and who says it won't do more harm through polarization than good?

I can't stop you, but I would ask you to consider how you're spending your time arguing on WashU confessions about matters upon which we have a minimal impact, and evaluate whether posting inflammatory statements and attempting to rile up campus is not only a good use of our time, but if it might be causing more harm than good.

For those of you who read all the way to the end before deciding to bash this post, thank you, I appreciate your taking the time to understand where we're coming from.
