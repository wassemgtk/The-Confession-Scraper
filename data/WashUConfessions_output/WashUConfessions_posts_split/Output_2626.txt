I was assaulted. Every time I see him on campus, I panic. A friend of mine sat and held my hand for hours. He didn't look at me, didn't say anything. We were in a group with others. But every now and then he'd give a little squeeze, or stroke his thumb across. He didn't ask, didn't call attention to it. But when I went home, I cried - not with fear, but with gratitude. He'll never know what it meant to me. That simple gesture made me feel safer and more secure than the Wash U administration and WUPD ever will.
