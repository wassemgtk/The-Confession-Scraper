I was in the ER a couple days ago and the doctor told me I had to get surgery. My parents are hundreds of miles away and were in no position to fly to see me. I didn't know who would be willing to come see me, or who to call and let know, or even who to list as my emergency contact. I was so scared. I felt so alone.
I did manage to tell one friend, who - I'm so grateful - came down and spent the night with me. But I'm still hesitant to tell other people because I can't gauge the depth of my relationship with them. I'm afraid that if I tell my friends they'll feel obligated to be nice to me or spend more time with me. I'm also afraid that my friends might keep contact to a minimum while I'm recovering because they find me burdensome. I don't want my friends to pity me. But more than that, I don't want to find out that the people I think of as my friends are only friends in the lightest sense of the word. I don't want to be alone, but I'd rather be in self-inflicted isolation than be abandoned by others.
