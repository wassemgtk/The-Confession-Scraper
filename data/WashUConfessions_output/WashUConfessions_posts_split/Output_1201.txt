Graduating senior being overly reflective here:

I think my mental health has been poor since second semester sophomore year. I've been struggling to do my work, care about extracurriculars and maintain my composure in stressful situations. I've snapped more often at people I care about. It was such a slow transition (with enough ups and downs to hide the trend) that it's been hard to tell if I'm actually sadder overall or it's another down to ride out until an up. But I'm pretty sure that yeah, my mental health took a longterm nosedive.

My grades are solid overall, and despite some regrets I've acceptable extracurricular involvement and good friends. What it boils down to I think is being sad about my family. My home life has gotten progressively shittier every semester, and I'm starting to think it's the source of most of my personality changes. I've been thinking things like "Why should I tolerate this crap when I already got to deal with all of this XYZ with my family" and yelling more. I've been thinking that no matter how much good I do here I'm not at home trying to fix things and it's tanked my self worth.

So to everyone who has stress at home of whatever sort, whether better or worse than me: I'm sorry you have to deal with it. I'm sorry you have to balance it with all the stress and academic rigor and busy-ness of WashU. I'm sorry that people you care about are hurting. But you're not alone, (woo, everybody's sad) and you'll have to try your best to keep going. That's what your family wants for you, hopefully.

That, and a well paying job to help support them and their bad financial decisions and emotional damages. Or is that just me?
