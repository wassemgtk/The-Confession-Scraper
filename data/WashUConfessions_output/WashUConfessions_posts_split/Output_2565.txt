I agree wholeheartedly and can absolutely relate to so many of these confessions, but I'm worried about commenting and reaching out -- or even just simply liking the post -- because I don't want my friends to see through my happy exterior.  I often feel like everyone is always posting pictures to make their lives appear super happy and perfect, but for one second, I just wish that people would stop with the facades so those who are struggling don't feel as alone.
