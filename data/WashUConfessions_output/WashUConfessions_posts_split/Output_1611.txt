I personally know quite a few white students that were offended by the line in Black Anthology. It didn't make us feel united, it made us feel alienated for a physical attribute and to be honest, considering we were all sitting in the theater and participating, none of us were responsible for discriminating against blacks.... therefore we were insulted for no reason.
