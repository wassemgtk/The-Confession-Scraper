I would like to "like" #1341# but I dare not, since I saw my friend's post there. I consider everyone should have same political rights, be equal before laws. Salute to post #1394#. And check post #1365#. People tends to overlook these posts, for they are politically incorrect, but you could not condemn it for being politically incorrect, as it starts with "As a black student myself".
