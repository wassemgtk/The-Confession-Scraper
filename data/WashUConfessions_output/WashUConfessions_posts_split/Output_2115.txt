I am a freshman who is freaking out about housing next year. I have a lot of friends in general, but I sitll havent found a core group of friends who I can reliably hang out with all the time. There are not a group of people exactly on my freshman floor who I can see myself living with, so I do not have that immediate group of friends on m floor. I dont know, I just feel like everyone already knows who they are living with next year except me.
