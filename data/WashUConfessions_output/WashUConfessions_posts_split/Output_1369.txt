It makes me sad that more people don't use plates/Eco to-go boxes. While I understand there's always those times when you're really in a rush/places like Holmes run out of Eco boxes, it seems like many just don't pay attention to the number of boxes they get through in a week. I live just above dining services and see people piling up boxes in their rooms, before finally throwing them out (sometimes in the trash, even with a recycling/compost bin 2 feet away...) We could all try to be a little more intentional in our actions :)
