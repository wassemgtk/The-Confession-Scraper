I saw some people at BD during Moonlight Breakfast who I know for a fact don't go here (I've seen them at events for CITY-WIDE greek life)  and for whatever reason that really grinds my gears. Like honestly, it shouldn't, but idk it makes me feel this vague, fuzzy form of anger. Kinda like "you guys don't go here and therefore don't pay tuition, so why are you benefiting from stuff you didn't pay for?" Idk, I understand that they probably had help from actual students, so I guess it's OK....No. Not really.
