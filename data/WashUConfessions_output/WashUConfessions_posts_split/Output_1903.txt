I recently got rejected from med school. For 3 and a half years people told me GPA doesn't matter and that college is the time when you should be exploring your interests. Well I did, and then I applied to med school with a GPA of 3.6. It's a joke how people say that grades don't define you because despite having stellar leadership and extracurriculars I was rejected by my dream med school, one that is not even in the top 20. Here is some advice to people considering med school: if you want to explore your interests as an undergrad, don't be premed. There is no light at the end of the tunnel.
