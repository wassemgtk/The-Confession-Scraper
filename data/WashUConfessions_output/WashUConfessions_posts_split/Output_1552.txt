Hey, I'm not sure where the best place to start a conversation about this is, but I'll try here I guess.

On the Sex Survey I was particularly surprised by the disparity in opinion on "is it sexual assault if one party is inebriated?" For reference, non Greek women are saying 70% yes, Greek men 39% yes (61% no). Greek girls and non-greek men are in the middle at 56%, and I guess we don't have stats on anyone gender nonconforming. Can we talk about this? I feel like as a campus we should all get on the same page, theres a bit of a split here...
