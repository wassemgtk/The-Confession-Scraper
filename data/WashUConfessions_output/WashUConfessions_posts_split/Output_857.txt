I just graduated. I'm an international student. I tried many times to get involved on campus  but I didn't have many friends when I graduated. Wash U is very friendly to international students, but  I still feel very sad that I didn't have any friends when  I graduated. And Wash U confession didn't post my comment last time made me sad too.
