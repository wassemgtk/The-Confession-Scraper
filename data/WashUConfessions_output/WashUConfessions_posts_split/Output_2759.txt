I'm having a really difficult time adjusting to life here. I just feel so lonely all the time. I don't feel like I will ever make any close friends here. I'm a rather shy person and I don't always love to go out and socialize and sometimes I just feel like the odd one out. Everyone seems so happy and well adjusted, but I miss home more than anything. I miss my old life, my home, my friends, and my parents. People seem to have such different values than me here. I'm not into partying and hooking up with people I barely know. I don't judge others for doing so, but I just can't relate to that lifestyle. I try to go and have fun that way but I just feel uncomfortable the whole time like I don't really belong. Maybe I'm lame, but I just wish I could find a few close friends to have fun with without going crazy. I haven't had a serious conversation since I got here. I want to go back home so badly, but I know that even home wouldn't be the same as it used to be.
