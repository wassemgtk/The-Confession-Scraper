I've been in an a relationship for over a year now, and now it's turned into an LD since I'm here at Washu. He's gotten really mean. Like today, he yelled at me over the phone for calling him at the wrong time (when he was doing the dishes and making breakfast). The last thing I said was, "I'm sorry I make you unhappy" and I hung up on him.

If I try to break it off like I've done before, he will tell me all the things he dislikes about me and be like "okay, go then," like he doesn't care; and I know if I try to talk to him about how I feel he will say, "this isn't our problem, you make problems up in your own head. Deal with it yourself."

It's been three hours and he hasn't called me back. I'm seriously considering pulling a disappearing act and never awnsering the phone again. I said what I needed to say - "I'm sorry I make you unhappy" - so I guess the best I can do is just give him the silence he wanted? :/ help. I don't know what to do about this relationship and I cry about it all the time.
