As someone who worked very hard to earn my spot in the business school, and someone who continues to struggle with my classes, I find it very discouraging when people say "b school pre-school" or imply that because I'm in the business school I don't have a lot of work or hard classes. Just an FYI: My classes are not easy. Sure, they aren't Gen Chem or Orgo, but they still challenge me and require a lot of effort to stay on top of them. I have the same amount of class time as most other students-- just because I don't have business classes on Fridays doesn't mean I get a "day off." I chose a major in the business school because I wanted to be able to help my parents support my other siblings through college. I also just really enjoy it and it's a career I can see myself pursuing, just like many of you wish to be doctors, lawyers, artists, or professors.

When people bash on my school, imply that my major is easy, and say I should be getting A's in all my classes, it's discouraging. We go to a really freaking difficult school, guys. Let's just accept the fact that we all worked hard to be where we are today and that we all chose different things to major in and leave it at that.
