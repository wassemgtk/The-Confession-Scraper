I think I may be in love with my best friend. I know they've mentioned having romantic feelings for me before, and I don't think those have gone away, but we just got to where we will be spending the summer, which is miles apart from each other. It feels silly to open this can of worms when we are not going to be in the same state for 3 months, but I would hate feeling like I lost my chance if say they find someone over the summer. What do? :/
