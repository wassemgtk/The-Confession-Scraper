I ALWAYS feel very upset when people are talking loudly in the library. People come to the library because they want a quiet space to study. I understand that you'd like to say hi to your friends, but talking loudly in the library for half an hour is very annoying. If you really want to talk, why can't you go find some other places? There's Whisper right next to the Olin Library where you can talk whatever you like. Shame on those who get into Wash U, but talk loudly in the library.
