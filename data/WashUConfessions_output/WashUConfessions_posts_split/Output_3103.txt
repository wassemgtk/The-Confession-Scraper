I'm a disappointment to my family. I'm probably not going to graduate on time. I think I have a drug and alcohol abuse problem. I consider suicide every day. I know what method I want to use. I know when and where I want to do it. Every time I have sought help at SHS, they have cancelled my appointment because other students needed them more, which only makes me more convinced that I am worthless as a person. To my friends, I appreciate your support and I am sorry that I am such a piece of shit.
