I've had a boyfriend since the first few weeks being at WashU, and now that it seems like we are over, I'm scared out of mind. I don't know what college is like without him and I love to be in a relationship and to be in love.  I want to go back and be with him again, but he's hurt me too many times too deeply. How do I get over him?
