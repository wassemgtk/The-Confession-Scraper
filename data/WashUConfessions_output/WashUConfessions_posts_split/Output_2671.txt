I honestly think that psych services at this school are bullshit, and its making me have so much less respect for this school. I've been having some issues lately and called psych services almost 3 weeks ago only for the voicemail to answer stating for me to leave my name and number and they'll get back to me.  Guess  what? Not a single person has called me back and I've called multiple times. Are psych services even real at this school, or is it something they just put up online to make the school seem like a good place for its ranking and its endowment? Maybe that sounds like a ridiculous question, but I know many other people this has happened to in the past. I guess I'm just saying that I feel like this is a great example of how this school just fakes everything on the surface to make it seem pretty and great and beautiful when really, its a whole bunch of lies.
