To the people tipping generously at Cheeseology - thank you from the bottom of my heart. This news was unexpected and I and especially my coworkers have had a rough few days and have some difficult decisions to make, but the support some of y'all have shown has been amazing. It helps us out financially as we get ready for the struggle of finding new work in a tough job market, but more than that it just means a lot to us personally to know there's a whole community supporting us when we need it most. THANK YOU. #GiveCheeseGiveBack
