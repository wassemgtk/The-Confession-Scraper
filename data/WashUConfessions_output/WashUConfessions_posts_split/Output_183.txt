Someone asked me yesterday why I avoid Starbucks, and assumed in the process that I was unhappy about the cup brouhaha. First off, no, I'd give 100 to 1 odds that that was probably a marketing stunt, and second of all, I avoid them because their music is a special level of awful and their coffee is only mediocre.
