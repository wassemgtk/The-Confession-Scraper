Dear Admin,

I'm not sure why people think you're so great for reading a few sentences and clicking a couple times and posting things. You have finals true, but when you post outside of finals and people think you're doing such a great thing I just don't understand. Your job isn't that difficult and I'm pretty sure you're writing a vast majority of the posts that praise you. Hopefully you graduate soon and let someone more humble take your spot.

Sincerely,

Me

Wow you are salty. 

If you really think I write confessions about myself, you're welcome to talk to me in-person and look at the submissions logs from washuconfessions.com. I can't tell who a confession comes from but there are ways to know if they come from the same person. There just really isn't a way for all those confessions to have come from me. 

But it seems like you've pretty much already made up your mind. And considering you had to use my own website to anonymously send hate mail, I'm thinking you're too much of a coward to actually meet me face-to-face. 

You're right though, copying and pasting isn't hard. That's the part of the job that people see.  I don't really talk much about the other parts.

Reading suicide letters and knowing it's not a good idea to post them is hard. Reading posts every day from people who have been cheated on/want to cheat  is hard.  Dealing with student groups who want to censor certain confessions is hard. Putting up with people like you who abuse anonymity to spread hatred is hard. 

Regardless, I'm likely going to be stepping down next semester. But it's for my own good, not because you want me to. I'm sorry to be going to a school with a coward like you.
