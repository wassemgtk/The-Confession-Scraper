I just got my first semester GPA at WashU, and it was a 3.74.  I know it's not high school anymore and I can't expect 4.0s, but I also took a relatively easy course load (no math, science, Writing, or history), and yet I still couldn't get the grades I wanted.  And it's not like I spent all my time goofing off or partying; I worked hard for the grades I did receive.  I'm worried now that this is the highest GPA I'll ever get and as I take harder classes next semester, and the semesters after that, it's only going to get worse.
