I hate the barrier that some people draw between those who choose to drink and those who choose not to. I personally don't drink but I still go out with my friends to parties that have alcohol, and I think that's completely acceptable. However, I've dealt with multiple instances where I've told people that I don't drink and they've given me condescending glances and assumed that I don't have any fun. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion about how to have fun and about whether or not to choose to drink alcohol. It's just a matter of respecting each other's decisions and learning to be accepting of people with different views.
