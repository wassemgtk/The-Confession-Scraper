This is a two-part confession, so hang with me here.

I first confess that I'm sick and tired of people using Confessions as a political mouthpiece. Lord knows I have biases, but look--even if I agree with a post, I think it's unethical to use Confessions in this way.

When you submit a confession, it's going to reach a far broader audience than you could ever hope to reach using your own Facebook page. Using Confessions is leveraging that greater reach to score political points. What's more, you're protected from the consequences of your opinion. But, you say, isn't that the point of a Confessions page? That one can feel free to speak one's mind? Well, yes. But posting nakedly political content anonymously is, frankly, cowardly. An essential part of political discourse is the willingness to stand behind one's opinions and to defend them. Every time something controversial happens on or around campus--most recently, Black Anthology--I see a rash of "confessions" (scare quotes absolutely intended) from people apparently unwilling to take a public stand behind their criticism or rhetoric. That's gross. It lowers the quality of discourse. It distracts from what I see as the true goal of this page, which is to be a safe space for /personal/ confessions. Wash U Confessions shouldn't be your damn soapbox.

Now, given the rant above, it would be hypocritical to stop here. So my second confession: On MLK day, I went to the library to study around 6 in the evening, having forgotten it was closed. I had just walked into the lobby when I saw a girl leaving the library proper. (I don't know who she was--probably an employee.) On an impulse, I walked toward her, and she held the door for me, and I was in. And a quick tour revealed I had the library all to myself.

My second confession is that, for several hours between 6 and 11ish--when I knew the custodial staff would arrive--I got hella naked in the library, and nobody found me, and it was great.
Thanks for reading.
