I slept on campus twice in a roll. It was 4am and I was too tired to walk home in the cold, so I just picked a dark and carpeted area, put a book on the floor, and fell asleep. It was amazing. It felt like camping. No one was around. Just the humming of the heater and flickers of light from outside. I want to do it again but with a girl I like. She could use me as her pillow
