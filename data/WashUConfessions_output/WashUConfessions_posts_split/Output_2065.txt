I’m tired of hearing people complain about “social justice warriors,” “activists,” and generally anyone cares about anything that’s not themselves **just because they aren’t perfect and nice and sweet as cherry pie all the time**. The issues we’re bringing up about these people aren’t unique to them.

Why do people want to be doctors? To help people? To make money? Because it’s what they’ve been told to do? Because they just enjoy it? Because they want to be “successful?” Are these mutually exclusive?

Why do people go into any field? Do people usually do anything for one set reason? *Everyone* does things for tons of different reasons, and it’s ridiculous to pretend that people who are socially active are the only ones who ever do things wrong, or don’t say things as nicely as they could have, or have bad reasons for wanting to do good things.

I’m all for promoting healthy criticism of each other, but let’s at least be honest and recognize that at the end of the day we’re mostly a bunch of teenagers and young adults just trying to figure ourselves out and have some impact on a world that we’ll never really understand. Yes, people make mistakes. Yes, that includes “problematic” people. Yes, that includes “social justice whatever-you-want-to-call-thems.”

(sorry for caps)
DON’T LET PETTY ISSUES BE THE REASON YOU IGNORE THE SERIOUS ARGUMENTS PEOPLE ARE PUTTING FORTH ABOUT INJUSTICE. Also, let’s not falsely equate feeling ashamed of privilege or being yelled out by your fellow tuition-paying students is the *same* as being continually messed over by employers, and city planners, and police, and the justice system, and politicians, and just about everything else.
