I didn't realize how conservative I was until came to WashU, and for the past two years, I've been accepting and open-minded towards people who have opinions that do no agree with mine. However, I still feel like if I want to express my conservative viewpoints freely, I can't without some damned militant feminist or social activist raining hell fire down upon me telling me that I'm wrong in my opinions. Wake up assholes! If you're entitled your beliefs and that's your truth, then I have my truth too. If I can't say that I don't believe in pre-marital sex without being interrupted by someone snarkily saying, "Well, I guess I'm going to hell", then how am I supposed to openly receive what you have to say to me? You don't have to like or even understand my beliefs, but I just ask that you respect the fact that they're my beliefs.
