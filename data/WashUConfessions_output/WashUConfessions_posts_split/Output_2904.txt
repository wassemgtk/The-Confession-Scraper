There's a worker at Bear's Den Grill that makes the biggest scowl whenever I place my order. I like to order and burger and grilled chicken and be always says "man..." As if I'm putting him through an ordeal. He's messed up my orders twice, once by losing it. The other time by giving me salmon that was raw on the inside. When I, with as much as kindness as possible point it out, he just scowls at me again. He never apologizes and it ends up me apologizing profusely as if I've wasted his time or something. Honestly when he's working the grill, I avoid it and go to Paws n Go now.
