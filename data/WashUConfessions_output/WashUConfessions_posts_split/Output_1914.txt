I just want to say thank you to everyone who's posted the past few days about GPA not being everything. As a sophomore, I thought this was going to be the semester I turned everything around, but my GPA is terrible. I'm very involved, have amazing friends, and wouldn't give it up for anything! Don't get me wrong, I'm consistently pushing myself to do better and set high goals for my career down the line, but knowing that I'm not alone in mediocre academic success is comforting. Thanks WashU for providing me with amazing opportunities and room to grow!
