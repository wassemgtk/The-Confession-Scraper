Sometimes I get really annoyed with the WashU population. I don't get why everything anyone says or does has to turn into a critical analysis of our "perpetuation of the patriarchy" or a new strain of racism or whatever other politically incorrect social issue we want to get riled up about. Sometimes things just exist and happen. Although there could be some underlying wrong, we don't have to consistently bring it to light. I get being an activist about things, but let's breathe and spend time on what events and situations that really matter. Let's stop being petty and try just being happy for two seconds.
