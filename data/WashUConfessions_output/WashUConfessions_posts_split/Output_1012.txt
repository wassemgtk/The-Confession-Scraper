Please be kind to people who say they don't look forward to going home to family during summer.  For me, going home for the summer means going back to sleeping in a room that is 80 degrees and going to bed hungry because AC and food are expensive.  Also, my mother makes me feel completely empty and alienated, but honestly I can deal with that better than I can deal with being sweaty all the time.
