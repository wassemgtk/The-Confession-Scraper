I confess that I attempt to put myself into a eating disorder mindset but I have failed. I just cannot be anorexic. Restricting food jeopardizes my daily life so much that I cannot handle a restrictive diet (not extreme at all, ~1000 calorie a day without exercising) for even three days. I've binged and purged a few times but that just grosses me out.
Don't get me wrong. I am a psychology major and have probably read more books and journal articles on eating disorder than a clinical psych PhD student. I know eating disorders are serious, life threatening disorders and are not to be taken lightly. But my shape and weight has gotten into my way into doing literally anything. Seriously, a lot of people diet, but only a few end up with an eating disorder - it's a genes x environment thing and I would like to risk I do not have that genetic vulnerability. All I want is to be thin and have that determination to diet and slim up.
