I am a woman and I don't like having boobs. It's not that I want the body of a man or a boy, it's that I'd rather have a girl's body than a woman's. Specifically, my pre-puberty body. I think that was the most recent time I remember feeling happy about how my body looked, and it's not like I hate how it is now or anything, but I feel like now it's more about accepting my body than liking it, the way it was then.
