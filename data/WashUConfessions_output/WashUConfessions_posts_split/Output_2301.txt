Today, one of my old high school friends told me the only reason he's studying what he's studying and motivated to do it is because of the talks we have. He said that my encouragement over the past couple of years through brief Facebook conversations has meant everything. Now I realize that no matter what happens on my exam today, I at least have that. I think inspiring someone has to be my biggest accomplishment up until this point in my life. I'm not saying I'm some incredible mentor because in reality all I did was say "you've go this" and "I believe in you." I'm just saying that it's good to know how much the little things you do for a person helps.
