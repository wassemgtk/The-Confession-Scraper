It's that whole Irish thing, right? If you take yourself too serious, you're useless.
Have a laugh at your own expense. At someone else's. Whatever. Keep laughing. We're all going to die and go in the ground anyway, so who cares if someone laughs because you're black, or white? Who gives a damn if you are made fun of? It doesn't matter anyway. By all means, make fun of my hair, or the way I dress, or make fun of my stupid posters or shit like that. Please!
