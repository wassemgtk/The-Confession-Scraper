I'm ashamed because I have feelings for a guy (who probably doesn't feel the same way) and it is making me doubt my long-term long-distance relationship. I've been with this guy for two years, but I like someone else, and it makes me feel guilty. He is the only guy I have dated, but I feel like I should be with other guys too just to see what it is like.
