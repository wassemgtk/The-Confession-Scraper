I, too, have fallen victim to blaming WashU for my insecurities and anxiety - the coursework is extremely hard, I'm so far away from home, and the SHS system has flaws.  Still, I've realized that much of the blame of my anxiety falls on the insecurities thrust upon me by our campus community.  Everyone constantly competes over everything - the amount of sleep, stress, or our intelligence level (grades, number of credits).  None of these things are the same for everyone, so why do we constantly need to push them in one another's faces?

After the last two semesters, I've realized that I should only be taking 12-15 credits to keep myself mentally sane.  I need 6-8 hours of sleep each night to function well in the classroom, while others might not need the same.  Whenever someone tries to argue with me about the amount of tests they have next week and how I don't deserve to be under as much stress as them, I now just stop listening.  If you need to go to office hours, go!  If you don't, however, then don't - you don't need to criticize those that might not have understood the material as well as you.

If society encourages us to stop comparing our body sizes and appearance, we should also stop comparing the rest of our experiences.  Life is to be lived as one's own journey with the involvement and contributions of others, but our lives should not be lived in order to exactly mirror others.  Your entire experience at WashU is yours to create, so don't feel like you should or should not do something because of someone else - do it for you!
