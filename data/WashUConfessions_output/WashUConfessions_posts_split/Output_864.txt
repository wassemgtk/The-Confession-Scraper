I can't speak for everyone, but my problem personally is with those people who try to excuse their condition but who actually haven't made much effort to rectify their situation. To me, this really de-legitimatizes those who actually do suffer from medical conditions that make it hard for them to lose weight/stay thin. Not everyone who is overweight suffers from medical conditions (I actually have a few relatives with hypothyroidism, so I'm aware that there are diseases that exist), and typically when I talk to people who are overweight, this tends to be the case... It really bothers me when people try to make excuses for their lifestyle rather than just admit the truth that their weight/body condition is the result of their lifestyle choices. For those people who have a legit condition though, I am supportive of, and for those same people who try to improve their lifestyle regardless of the difficulty, I have the utmost respect.

If I had to theorize why other people see overweight individuals in a negative light, it's for similar reasons. A few bad apples spoil the bunch, and in this case, I think they outnumber those individuals with factors that are beyond their control (based on what I've read in medial research). I do think people approach this issue poorly a lot of the time though
