Although this doesn't affect everyone at Wash U, I feel like I have to say this. I feel like the LGBT community at Wash U is totally noninclusive. If you don't know anyone or you are not totally and flamboyantly out, then it's incredibly difficult to make friends. The community is very cliquey and quick to dismiss people. We face social isolation in so many ways throughout society, we don't need it in a place where we should all feel comfortable. I wish I could say that I feel welcome, but I don't.
