I realized something today. There will always be a problem set to do, a reading to complete and a test to study for (and if you're premed, literally always). Those things are constant. What isn't constant, is your friends. Real friendships require actual work, they require commitment and time that you may not necessarily always want to give up. Please don't be afraid to give up that time, in fact don't look at it as "giving up time". Please realize that the people you have in your life are (usually) there for a reason, but that they will not always be there. You need them just as much as they need you. Don't take them for granted.
