I confess that I will probably not be able to rush this semester due to academic reasons. I am scared that all my friends are rushing and that I will be missing out on a lot of fun. While I understand academics are my priority, I am not looking forward to next semester because I fear I will have no social life. All my friends I made last semester are planning on rushing and I feel like I am going to be left behind.

I know I can always rush as a sophomore, but has anybody gone through this before? Will I survive even if all my friends are rushing? Also, how seriously does IFC enforce the 2.5 GPA rule? What if I have a 2.49?
