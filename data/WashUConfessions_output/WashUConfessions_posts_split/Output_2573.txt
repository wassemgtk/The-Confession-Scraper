I confess that I look down on people taking pre-med required classes at other schools during the summer just to protect their GPA from hard classes.  I get it that orgo is hard, but paying for a much easier class is a cop out.  You came to Wash U for a reason; because it's a great (albeit difficult) school.  Avoiding these hard classes cheapens your degree and should be looked upon about as highly as getting a C in a Wash U class.  Honestly if you cannot handle organic chemistry or general biology, it seems to me you're simply not cut out to be a physician.
