I really want a boyfriend. I can't decide which of the two possible reasons that this is a result: 1) I want that adorable feeling of companionship. 2) I want sex. Nay, I need sex. My legs are open to ANYTHING with a pulse at this point. Holla. PS: I am writing this drunk, which implies that I am both incredibly lonely and incredibly horny... Typical Tuesday.
