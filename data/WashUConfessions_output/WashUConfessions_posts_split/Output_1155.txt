I'm a prefrosh who picked WashU over a lot of other schools because it seemed like the students here were the happiest and it seemed like having a good time was more important than getting straight A's. For the past few weeks though, from looking at this, yik yak, etc. that WashU kids are not only super stressed, but many feel negatively about the school and regret going. I kinda feel like crap now and a part of me wishes I had gone elsewhere (brown, duke, penn, pomona etc.). Everyone seems to bash WashU. Do you regret going? Are all colleges like this?
