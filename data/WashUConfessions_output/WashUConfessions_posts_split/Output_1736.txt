I participated in sorority rush last year, but when nearly every sorority dropped me, I took myself out of the process. When bid day arrived, I felt sick in my bed hearing happy screaming down the halls from the girls who got in. I felt like I was less desirable than them, and it hurt so badly.

I told myself that I wouldn't rush again. The groups I clicked with didn't want me, so why would the next year be any better? I would suffer the same anxiety again, and for what? Maybe a repeat of this nightmare. I also couldn't bear the thought of crawling back to the same people who rejected me, it seemed pathetic. I was simultaneously terrified of reliving my experience, and so jealous of my friends, all of them it seemed, that found homes in their sororities.

Now, I'm a sophomore, and I didn't rush again. The few friends I have that had similar experiences to mine freshman year are rushing again, and their processes are going much better than before. They are optimistic that this time around, they will find a place that fits.

I thought that sticking to my gut instinct to not rush would help me move on from this fixation on my rejection, but I'm still just as torn up about rush this year as I was before. I can't help but wonder if my pride prevented me from moving on, or from being a part of something I still genuinely wish I were a part of.
