When I was in Mexico over Spring Break, I bought cocaine from a coconut seller. I didn't look for a coke dealer; all I wanted was a coconut. While I was eating the coconut that I bought from him, he asked me if I wanted marijuana, mushroom, cocaine, and heroin in that order. Clearly, if I don’t want marijuana, I want to shoot up heroin. Being a curious person, I wanted to know what the price of coke was in rural Mexico. One thing led to another, and we reached a deal. Half of a gram of la coca for 100 pesos (8 bucks) (I mean, I didn’t think that it would be thaaaat cheap.. the dude started from 500 pesos). He told me that he’ll get the coke and that he’ll meet me on the beach in an hour. But as soon as I made the deal, I began regretting it. I’m totally down for trying new things, but snorting some unknown white powder that could just easily be crushed glass as it could be a very highly addictive substance that some opportunistic coconut and drug dealer on a nudist Mexican beach sells me scared me. So I avoided the beach and moved on to the next village the next day. Sometimes, I feel like a bad person for not following through on the deal. He was so excited to make the coke sale to a “chino.” Maybe I should have let him overcharge me for another coconut as a peace offering.
