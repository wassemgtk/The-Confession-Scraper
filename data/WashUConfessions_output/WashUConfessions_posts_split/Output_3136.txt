Folks in Bear's Den always assume that I want it for to-go unless I specify it. Which is dumb because I thought they were supposed to endorse the more environmentally friendly "for-here" or "Eco-to-go"? Sometimes even when I check the box for "Eco to Go" in my order in Bear's Den, they disregard it and gives me a to-go box instead.
