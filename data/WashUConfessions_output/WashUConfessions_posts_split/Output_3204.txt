i really admire beta's ability to be creative and bend the rules for everything they participate in! i mean last thurteene they really weren't afraid to be different. instead of actually building a facade, they just bought an old barn, disassembled it, and reassembled it on the lot! and for kappa karaoke, even though every other fraternity has their pledges do a dance, they weren't afraid to break that boundary and create a dance with mostly brothers! they also didn't even make a new dance, they took their time to watch music videos and completely copy those dances. they seem to be really good at just copying things that already existed! so shout out to all the boys in beta and their ability to "be creative." can't wait to see what they'll come up with next!!!
