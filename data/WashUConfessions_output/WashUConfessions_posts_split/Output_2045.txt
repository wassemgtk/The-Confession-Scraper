Every day, I spend hours perusing through Facebook and liking the old photos and statuses of my RAs and WUSAs. It's all I do in my free time, and I get so much self-gratification for it. Recently, several WUSAs of the dorm (other floors) decided to social-network-exile me from their lives by blocking me. I feel so sad and lonely. I'm pretty shy and awkward in person, so I express my friendliness through social media. Please unblock me.
