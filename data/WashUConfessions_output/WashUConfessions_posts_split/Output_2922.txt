I spent the last 3 years working hard towards 2 majors that I don't love (both of which are in the B-school) all because I listened to those people who assured me that getting a job after graduation would be a breeze. Well, the whole breeze thing isn't turning out to be accurate in my case. Although I've gone to many of the job fairs this semester and I've gotten several interviews, I have been rejected for every single job for which I've applied. To add fuel to the fire, so many of my friends came back from this summer with a job already lined up. Although I'm happy for them, the contrast in our situations makes me feel like a worthless idiot. I should've majored in something I loved even if it meant that my post-grad job prospects wouldn't be all that great- at least I'd potentially be happy in my unemployment (admittedly, that's questionable). However, I know for sure that I at least wouldn't feel like a world-class loser for graduating from one of the top business schools in the nation but being unable to secure a job. Regardless, I have no one to blame but myself. Learn from me, kiddos.
