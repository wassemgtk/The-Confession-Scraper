I believe Darren Wilson and Michel Brown are both human beings deserving of compassion, empathy, and respect. They are not symbols, caricatures, or martyrs for a cause. They are simply persons that are as complex as any of us, with a a corresponding flaw for each time they made a person smile. I believe the best way to honor them is to approach this debate with love in our hearts, but given the current climate, I am scared to say this out loud.
