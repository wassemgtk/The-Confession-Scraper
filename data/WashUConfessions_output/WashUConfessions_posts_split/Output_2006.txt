Freshman year one of my best friends joined a sorority and since then she has become unrecognizeable. She used to be nice and friendly but ever since she joined [Sorority Name Redacted] her ego went through the roof and shes become so full of herself to the point where I no longer want to be friends with her after a year of her acting like this. I am not sure what to do or how someone could have changed so fast. I have a few other friends in this sorority who have changed in a similar way. I caution anyone considering joining this sorority to seriously reconsider. Greek life should not change who you are.
