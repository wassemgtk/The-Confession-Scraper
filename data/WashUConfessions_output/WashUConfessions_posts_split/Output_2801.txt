I feel like the people who are annoyed at all the "depressing" stuff on this site don't understand what this site can be used for. It's a way of revealing our innermost thoughts under complete anonymity. We can't say this stuff to the majority of people because we can barely acknowledge and reconcile it ourselves. You think it's depressing after reading a short blurb that you'll forget in 10 minutes? Try living with it everyday.
