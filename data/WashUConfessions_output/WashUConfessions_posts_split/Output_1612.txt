While I did like Black Anthology's message that black people also come from all walks of life and are very diverse as a race, I did not appreciate the message that was sent when the character Jordan silenced another girl when she said she wanted to get all of the information before coming to a conclusion. Saying stuff like, "All the information you need to take this photo is that a white officer shot an unarmed black teenager and that is never ok" only breeds more hostility. If you're asking people to listen to you and what you have to say, you should be able to do the same and consider the possibility that you may not be 100% correct in your views. Yes minorities are still discriminated against, and there are still many cases of wrongful death, but by stereotyping and generalizing the police force as faceless uniforms is committing the same transgressions that you say are being held against you. Police officers are people too, with lives and families and stories. I understand that this cause is important, but maybe the faces of the cause should be cases where there is no argument, like when it is caught on camera, instead of cases where all we have to go off of are faulty eyewitness reports and inconclusive evidence. Listen to somebody's story before making a judgement, for listening leads to questioning, questioning leads to understanding, and understanding leads to change.
