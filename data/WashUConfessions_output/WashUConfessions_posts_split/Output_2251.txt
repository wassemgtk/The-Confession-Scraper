When I didn't get accepted as a transfer to this school, I was devastated. I wanted to attend WashU since middle school, but after seeing all the fighting on this page, I'm starting to think that that rejection was the best thing that happened to me. My school's confession page is nothing like this, nor is any other school's confession page I've ever followed.
Even the posts that aren't about activism make it seem like the school didn't select a cohesive bunch of students. Most of the rest of the posts are about how bad you are at making friends or how much you hate "hookup culture."
