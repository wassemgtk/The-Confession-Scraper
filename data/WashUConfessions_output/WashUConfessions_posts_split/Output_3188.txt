I want to share my views on the depression debate, as somebody who was diagnosed with clinical depression almost a year ago. When I posted my confession, the last thing on my mind was how it would make the school look. I am sorry if it turned anybody off of Wash U, that wasn't my intention. Its not fair to judge a school based on a few unhappy people, because every school faces these issues. Instead, look at the response. Complete strangers giving their phone numbers for support. Only a few childishly dismissed the "whiners". Depression happens everywhere, and the measure of a school is how it reacts. By this standard I am proud of Wash U.
