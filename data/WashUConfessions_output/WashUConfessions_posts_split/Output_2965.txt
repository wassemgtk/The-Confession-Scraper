Campus Cries: UT Austin: "I wasn't accepted to the major I wanted because my high school didn't give class ranks. Overcrowding and the Texas 10% rule screwed me." UC Berkeley: "Budget cuts and fewer classes being offered forced me into summer courses/5th year." USC: "My university doesn't guarantee 4 year housing and I don't want to live off campus which isn't in the best part of LA." Case Western: "My fantastic university is being choked by the struggling city of Cleveland." WUSTL: "Connie replaced something on the menu." Admit it, we have it pretty good.
