I am an Asian who never experienced going to school or living in an area with people of the same race as me until college. My high school was primarily African American, Hispanic, and white. The only reason I ever felt uncomfortable was when I knew that my friends parents/grandparents were openly racist or that many people would never date me because of my race. Interestingly enough, those were not taboo topics. When I came to WashU my increase in comfort stemmed from people being much more accepting of other races than the place I came from. I guess I'm posting this to say that there is a different minority race in each different community and being around people of my own race makes no difference to me, the only thing that matters is being around people who are accepting and tolerant. I never feel uncomfortable if there are not people of the same race as me, but I do feel uncomfortable when people categorize my experiences,values, and worth based upon my race.

I have found that for me, race doesn't say as much about me as my future aspirations and personality do. For this reason, I surround myself with people who share similar aspirations and similar personalities rather than those of the same race.

I know I will only ever be able to fully understand my own experiences, and I understand that everyone has different experiences!  It's nice to be able to share a bit of my story.
