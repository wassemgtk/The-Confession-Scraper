What Wash U Confessions has become: Original poster - "I don't like (fill in group) for the following reasons: (either someone was an asshole or insensitive)." Comments: 1. Student in agreement: "Yeah (group being criticized) sucks!" -----gets <5 likes. 2. Angry member of that group: "You don't know us! And you're such a coward for posting anonymously!" ----- 10-25 likes. 3. Over-confident sarcastic fraternity member: (fill in comment about how awesome Greek life is here). ------- 20 likes all from Greeks 4. Random person: (fill in sexual and probably somewhat perverted comment here) -------- 50 likes So what we have learned os that everyone posts the same shit all the time. Not everyone is going to like every group, and whether you attack or defend a group doesn't make you a bigger person. You're still sitting behind a computer screen like everyone else. So let's not take this stuff personal, because anonymity is meant to be impersonal!
