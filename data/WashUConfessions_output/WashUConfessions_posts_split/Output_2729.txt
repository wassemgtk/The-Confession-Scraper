At a school that is sometimes jokingly referred to as "WashJew" due to its large Jewish population, I have been incredibly disappointed in the fact that I am less connected to my own Jewish identity now than ever before in my life. You'd think that with so many different organizations on campus, I'd find one that would be a good fit, but I've had no such luck. Hillel has been so superficial in their interest in me when I show up to their events. I was horrified when Chabad made a very public request for my money and my parents' money when I went to a Shabbat dinner during last year's Parents Weekend (even though no one had talked to us there the entire night). The JLE group has tried to push me into being much more religious than I actually am. My parents are so disappointed in me for not being more involved with Jewish life on campus. I think they understand my hesitation after that experience at Chabad last year as well as a number of lackluster experiences I've had at Hillel, too. Still, they wish I was more involved. I wish I was more involved, too! I feel so sad that even though there are many different Jewish groups on campus, I feel alone and isolated from them all. I wanted to share my experience and wonder if anyone else has had a similar experience?
