Back when I did FSAP a few years ago, my RA told me that it was good luck to piss on the bunny the night before a test.

The night before my first test I ran all the way to the bunny and peed all over it. I mean all over it. I really gave that bunny a rinse. I walked back to Lee feeling unstoppable.

Unfortunately I still failed my first exam at WashU and since then I have never once heard that peeing on the bunny is "good luck."
