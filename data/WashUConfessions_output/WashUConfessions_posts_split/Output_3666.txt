I think its kind of crazy how elitist the b-school students are here on campus. Just because other people are studying what they love and are really interested in doesn't make them any less smart or well-off. Nobody cares about how much money you think you'll be making in 5 years. Also, I'm a double major in business from sam fox and i've scored above average on every single business test i've taken, so we're not all as dumb as people think. The art/design/architecture students (art-sci too!) are awesome, give us some respect.
