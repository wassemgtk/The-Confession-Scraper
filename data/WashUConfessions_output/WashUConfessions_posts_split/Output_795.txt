Here is something I would love to see on Facebook. People who are Pro-Gay Marriage posting what they think the "other sides" argument is. People who are Pro-Traditional Marriage posting what they think the "other sides" argument is. Then people who are on the "other side" can like the posts that correctly outline their view. If your post doesn't get any likes, you don't understand what the other side believes.
