A close friend of mine is a drug addict. Originally he was just a harmless pothead, but in the past year he has begun to use increasingly harder substances. I hung out with him once in early August after not seeing him for the entire summer. He was high on painkillers, but we had a pleasant conversation that lasted about an hour. I saw him again the next day, and he had no memory of hanging out with me the night before. He forgot I was even in town. A few weeks ago, he was so high that he could barely stand or speak. I sat next to him and messed around on his laptop — updating his Facebook with dumb statuses, tweeting stupid things, etc. I thought it was funny at the time, but in retrospect it was sad that he was so far gone that he didn’t notice. I have more stories, but I don’t want this post to be too long. He gets passing grades and isn’t in any immediate danger of failing out. I would tell him that I’m concerned, but we are not nearly as close as we used to be, and I know it wouldn’t help. I no longer enjoy spending time with him, and he has no hobbies or interests that aren’t related to drugs. He deals and has some misdemeanors on his record (alcohol-related), so if he got caught he’d be screwed. What most concerns me is how often he mixes hard drugs with alcohol and pills. He’s managed to avoid overdosing, and I don’t think this combination usage has caused him any health problems so far (I actually don’t know — I don’t think he would tell me if it has), but I worry. I would estimate there’s a 10 to 20 percent chance he dies before graduating. This is a rough guess, but my point is that the possibly definitely exists. I know his parents well, and they know we are/were very close. If he dies, I would certainly be asked to speak at his funeral. Given this background, would it be distasteful to prepare a eulogy in advance? I was thinking of writing one over winter break. If he were to die while I am still in school, it would greatly inconvenience me. I have enough work as it is. I don’t need to be writing what is essentially yet another paper. From a practical standpoint, this protects my GPA. But is this moral? Would it make me a bad friend?
