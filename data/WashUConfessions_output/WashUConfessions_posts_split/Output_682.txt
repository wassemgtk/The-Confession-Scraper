I think I'm falling in love with a friend who lives in another state and doesn't go to WashU and I'm terrified. I would love to be with him but our positions make a relationship impossible. I'm scared that I'll get hung up on him and won't be able to have satisfying relationships at WashU, but I'm also afraid that I'll end up falling for someone here while still not having found closure with my friend.
