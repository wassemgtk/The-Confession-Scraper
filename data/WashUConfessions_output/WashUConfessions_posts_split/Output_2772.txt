I honestly don't understand why a lot of people are on Tinder. I swipe right if I want to hook up with you, not because I want to ask you about your fucking major. Call me shallow, call me a douche, call me a slut, I don't care. If you feel so negatively about casual sex, A) Ditch your misplaced judgement, and B)  there are better places than Tinder.
