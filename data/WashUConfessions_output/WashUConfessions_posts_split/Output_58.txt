I confess that I've been thinking a lot lately about what we do after someone commits suicide. I've seen people filling Facebook with meaningful tributes to people who have taken their own lives and I can't help but think about how messed up it is that we do this only once people are gone. Why don't we tell people how much they mean to us just because we care, and we can?
