My family was very sad when they cannot sit in the Graham Chapel to watch me for my graduation. They have to sit in the Lab Science because all the seats have been taken 1 hour prior to the graduation ceremony. However, there are some groups of current students sitting in the Graham Chapel to watch a few of their friends graduate. I know a group takes up at least 10 seats. Your friends' graduation is important. My family was sitting in Lab Science with many parents who travel from very far places, many of them even come from abroad. They can't even see their sons and daughters walk the stage in person. They have to watch the whole ceremony from a screen that's not even clear, sitting in a room in Lab Science...while some current students who will attend their own graduation some day sitting in the Graham Chapel. I am very sad.
