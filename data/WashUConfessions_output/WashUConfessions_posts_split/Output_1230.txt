It seems like the vast majority of students here come from very supportive, loving homes. But not all of us do. I’m sure there are many others who come from abusive or dysfunctional families. So please don’t jump to conclusions if we want to stay on campus over break or if we aren’t exactly thrilled to be going home for the summer.

I get it. You’re excited to be with people you love and care about. But for many of us, WashU represents the freedom to be a person that for whatever reason we could never be at home.

So please don’t accuse us of not loving our parents enough, or try and teach us the “value” of family, or even badger us with questions about why on earth we wouldn’t want to go home for a week.

You don’t know what our home lives are like. Just respect our decision and try to understand.
