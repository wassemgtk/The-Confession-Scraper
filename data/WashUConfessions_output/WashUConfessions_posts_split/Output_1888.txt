There was a point in the semester where I didn't have five dollars to get a sandwich at Subway. I hadn't eaten in three days and was digging through all of my pockets for change. It made me feel so worthless. I would say I didn't have a dollar to my name, but additionally my bank account was $200 in the negative. None of my friends have any idea that I'm living in poverty. Lower class people can't afford to say that money doesn't buy happiness.
