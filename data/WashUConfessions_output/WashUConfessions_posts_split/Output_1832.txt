I confess that I started dating a boy on campus freshman year because he had a nice car and a lot of money. He is hot and well-liked on campus. I don't love him but we've been dating for over three years now and we're graduating this May. Honestly I'm in love with another guy who has no money and I want to tell him but I feel like I'd be letting a lot of people down. The guy I'm dating is almost definitely going to propose to me once we graduate, but I don't know what to do.
