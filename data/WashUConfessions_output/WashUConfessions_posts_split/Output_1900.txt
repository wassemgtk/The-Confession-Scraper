As a recent graduate who's observed all these  depressing posts about GPA and stuff, I feel I should offer my own insights from my experience. Mostly, they're my take on some of the cliches people have posted or said to me personally. It's a long post, so you might want to grab a drink or two before reading.

First, as a student, you are, by definition, defined by your GPA. A student's goal is to study and your GPA is an assessment to your studies. Anyone who says otherwise is delusional, but I'll get to that in my second point. But just because you have to be defined by your GPA doesn't mean it has to be the ONLY thing defining you. Whether you want to be defined also by something else is up to you. Realistically speaking, unless you win a Nobel prize while in college, your GPA is still going to be your majority defining factor. It's not a rational way to define someone, but it is the reality; if you go to college, people are going to think in the back of their heads what your GPA is. But how much it matters is a mystery, and while I'm sure GPA matters more when applying for med school than an investment banking job, it's still only one of many factors that is incomprehensible by anyone outside of the people actually making the decisions.

Second, and this is what pisses me off the most personally, following the advice of people who say "Your GPA dosen't define you" or "Follow your passions" or any related spiels is a horrible idea. Why? Because these people might be one in a million. It's extremely easy for them to tell people that stuff but following their footsteps is irrational because they might've just lucked out on some aspects. Nothing is impossible, but that simply means the odds do not equal to zero. From a practicality standpoint, what you should acknowledge is not whether a goal is possible, but rather opportunity cost: is what you desire such an uphill battle that your time and energy are better devoted elsewhere? People always like to say "You could be the next Bill Gates/Mark Zuckerberg/Steve Jobs." Well you can't, because there's only one Bill Gates/Mark Zuckerberg/Steve Jobs. Just because you saw one person do it doesn't mean you could too.

Finally, realize that life is cruel. We probably all jumped for joy and frivolously bought an iPad or something when we got accepted to WashU. For all you folks struggling with your own personal problems: I hate to add insult to injury, but all this suffering you feel is indeed your own fault. You chose to come to WashU because of prestige or whatever other reason(s) and now look at what your decision rewards you with. Life is not a utopia; it's survival of the fittest. Employers, graduate schools, or even the classes you're taking right now aren't going to change solely because you're struggling. So ask yourself if you really have what it takes to progress in life, because as you've experienced for yourself, it's not easy, and if you don't have what it takes, you're simply going to get left behind and no one is going to care, because this planet is overpopulated anyways.

Sorry for the bluntness, but as someone who fell prey to words that gave me a false sense of hope, I at least want to try and ensure it doesn't happen to others too. People who tell you your GPA doesn't matter and anything related are trying to make you feel better when in reality, they're doing the exact opposite and don't even realize the damage they're doing. Telling someone it's all going to be fine isn't fine; it's worse than of doing nothing and not caring, because you're inadverdently setting people up for goals that they're not qualified for, and that forces these people to waste so much of their time that they could be putting to better use. People don't want to feel better; they want the truth.

But underneath all the cliches I've heard so far, there's one silver lining: your success is what you make of it. For me, probably many of you, coming to WashU was one of my biggest mistake. I could've easily achieved all the accomplishments I've had and my job if I had just gone to my state school, and saved a lot of money in the process. I have a friend at said state school who I remember was extremely disappointed that he didn't get into WashU. But he really made the most of what he does have and is thus having a better time there with a much better job lined up than I ever did at WashU.

To tie it all up, life is cruel. Your GPA does define you; believing those who tell you otherwise is foolish; using the success stories of one of a few individuals as inspiration is also foolish; and only the strong can really succeed, and maybe even survive, in life. But the only person who can make a difference in your life is you. So the next time you get rejected from med school or didn't get that job you want, just remember that only you get to decide whether there is still light at the end of the tunnel. And remember there is always resources around for you to capitalize on; it just may not be always so easy to spot.

Life isn't about setting goals and achieving them; it's about making the most of what you do have. Setting goals is only important in that it gives you the drive to progress in life. The bottom line is you can't have it all. There's a tradeoff to every choice you make, and every decision you make, whether it's right decision or a mistake, puts you in a different situation, and it's up to you to utilize your resources and decision-making to put you on the optimal next path.You're likely never going achieve the goals you've set for yourself, but if you optimize your tradeoffs well, you'll instead likely achieve something awfully close to whatever goal you have set.

That's all for now, folks. I'm out of beer and I think I've said enough for one night. If anyone has any questions, leave it in a comment, and I'll anonymously try to reply to you (So long as the admin will allow it).

Yeah, I'd be more than happy to allow it.
