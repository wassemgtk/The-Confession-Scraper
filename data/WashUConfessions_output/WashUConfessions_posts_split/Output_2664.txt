Met a girl on the third floor of the library last night. She was crying, so I asked her what was wrong and if I could help. After a few minutes of conversation, she admitted that it was her 21st birthday and she had no one to go out with. 

She is absolutely beautiful, I could not believe that she was so lonely on her birthday. I told her there was a bar stool somewhere with her name on it and I would be honored to go out for drinks with her. She accepted, and we had an amazing night. We must have hit every bar on the loop. Afterwords I walked her home to her apartment and kissed her on the doorstep. She cried and told me that I had given her the best night of her life. I said I would love to take her out again sometime if that was ok, she said yes and gave me her number. 

The problem is I am a super shy person and I'm afraid to text her. Pretty girls have never paid much attention to me before her. Also, I have never been in a relationship and i'm scared out of my mind to try. What should I do?
