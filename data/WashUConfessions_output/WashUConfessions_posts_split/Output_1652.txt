In response to #2162 and #2164...  I work in a restaurant on the Loop and there are as many misconceptions about WashU students from the people I work with as WashU students have about them. Obviously be polite but at the end of the day we just appreciate y'all's business. It gives a job to me and a lot of really great people. I know the weather sucks but please trudge down to the loop sometime and help us out. Also imo everybody should do food service at some point. Humbling experience.
