I find the world unfair on which I, as a tutor, earn the same money per hour by explaining concepts and solving problems to people non-stop for an hour with some of the camera operators in the lectures who basically goes into the booth, turn on the camera, set it at an angle that sees all of the boards at the same time (who cares about whether you can read the stuff on the board, right?) and turn it off at the end of the lecture. Oh, and you also don't have to have the audio recorded... (This rant is definitely not meant for the camera operators who do a brilliant job of following the professor with the camera and zooming in/out at the right places--you all keep up the good work!)
