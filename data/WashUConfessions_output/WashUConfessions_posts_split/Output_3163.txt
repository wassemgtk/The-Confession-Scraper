Pretty much every time I get a salad or wrap with tofu, there's at least one or two pieces of chicken instead of tofu. I'm not even vegetarian, but it's still weird tasting chicken when you were expecting tofu. I imagine it would be even worse if you didn't eat meat at all. They should really be more careful not to mix those...
