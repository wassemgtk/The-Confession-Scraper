I'm not a WashU student, but I do have strong feelings for one of your finest sophomore girls. We dated shortly in the last few weeks of senior year in high school. However, when it came time to move away from our city to different schools (rival schools, actually,) she decided to leave all the emotional baggage at home, and told me she'd like it if we could go back to being 'friends.' You know, the kind of fractured friendship that is quite clearly not as close nor as friendly nor as meaningful as it was before the relationship. So my message to the guy(s) out there who are lucky enough to be with her during her time in St. Louis - I hope you treat her with all the care, respect, and admiration you can afford, because honestly, she's most likely the greatest girl you'll ever be with. And to the girl - I'm always ready to resume being friends, in the actual sense of the word.
