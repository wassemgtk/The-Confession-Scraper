Years ago, I thought I was worthless, that I didn't have any direction, and I came so close to killing myself.  I'm in a much better place now, but it terrifies me that I was one bad day away from destroying my entire future.  I would have missed out on the happiest days of my life because I was too shortsighted to appreciate what I had.
