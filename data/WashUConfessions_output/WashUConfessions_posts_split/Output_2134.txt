So the last few weeks have been absolute crap for me. Academics have been consuming my time and my spirit (with less than spectacular results), I've been feeling incredibly down, I've spent next to no time with the people I care about and I've gotten really sick to the point where I'm visiting SHS biweekly. I've lost my voice and appetite, I get hardly any sleep and fun's more like a vaguely remembered  friend from middle school than anything tangible.
The last time I was in SHS, I got called up as another student entered the lobby. He beat me to the desk and asked for an appointment and got told to fill out a little slip.

 As I despondently walked up with another twenty bucks and my insurance card thinking "this is my life, can I return it for another one" I briefly glanced over at the guy and his slip:
CAUSE OF VISIT: ACCIDENTALLY SWALLOWED PENCIL
Thank you sir. I don't know who you were before this and where you went after, but I felt so much better after reading that damn slip of yours. May you prosper and never shit a splinter.
