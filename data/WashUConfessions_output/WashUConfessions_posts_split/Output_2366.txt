I don't mean to overload anyone with another post about depression, but here it goes...

I am a guy and I have struggled with depression and an eating disorder for 3 years. (I say "I'm a guy" because that's what makes the eating disorder more embarrassing for me.) I can't take it anymore. It feels like I have nothing to live for, except for my family (that is far away) and my grades (which, recently, haven't been so hot). Whenever I get a terrible grade, I feel like just another aspect of my life is going down the drain. Counselors haven't helped and I don't know what else to do. I have considered taking time off from school, but then I'll be falling behind in life. I feel so alone right now. I'd really appreciate some advice.
