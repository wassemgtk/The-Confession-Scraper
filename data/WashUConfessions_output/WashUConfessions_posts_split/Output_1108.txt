I get a taste of what Gatsby felt like when I stare at my ex's green dot on facebook messenger. I don't want to repeat the past. I want to fix it. Or at least let her know how much I regret what I did. Her friends said that would upset her more, and I never wanted to make her cry and I still don't. So I sit in silence. She deserves to not be stressed.
