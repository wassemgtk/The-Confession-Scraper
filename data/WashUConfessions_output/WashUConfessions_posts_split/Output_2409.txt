WashU is so bullshit sometimes. The science departments, based on some bullshit rankings, are among the best in the nation. I am taking bio and physics this year, and I expected one or both of these courses to have been run a fraction of how well the chem department is run.
        But no, every bio lecturer here is among the worst teachers I’ve ever had; some are condescending, some talk completely incoherently, and they all just straight up don’t teach the material well, then they expect you to make huge leaps in logic on the exams (which are always way harder than the practice material) to figure out things they never explicitly taught.
        Then theres physics, where even though I know several of the lecturers are very good, they run the course in a way that you literally have to teach yourself most of the material… The lectures are convoluted and do not get the major points across. And then they give you exams way harder than the practice material they’ve given you. I actually know less physics now than I did a month ago.
        I am pissed off. Why am I asking my parents to pay 60k a year for me to teach the material to myself? WashU ropes in students with its artificially inflated rankings, beautiful campus, and programs which are basically implemented so WashU can brag about itself — I mean for God’s sake I sprained my ankle last Friday and didn’t get it checked on campus out because SHS fucking closed at noon!
        All the time I wish I had gone to my state school, and I’m ashamed of myself for not having the courage to leave. Before I came here I assumed WashU was rigorous because the material was hard, but now I know that WashU is rigorous not only because the material is hard, but because they don’t fucking teach it.
