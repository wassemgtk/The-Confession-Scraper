Dear most washu students, You should be grateful that you could ask your parents for money, support or even job connection. Even if you don't have that, you should still be grateful that english is your native language, so  that you wouldn't have to worry about speaking out in class or to other people, in case you embarass yourslef because of your accent. I have yet to meet another like myself as washu, but As a fresh immigrant who come from a low income family and had to learn english from scratch, i'm so grateful that WashU had accepted me. True that washu has a need aware admission, but for the students that they do admit, they give out very generous scholarship that allows me to live a comfortable, luxurius even, life whch i would not be able to if i did not go to washu. True that i have to supply my income with research stipen in the summer and TA jobs during the semester, but they are jobs which also give experience and helps build resume. To top it off, washu gives me the opportunity to to study at one of the top schools in the best environment possible, for free. I'm trying to make the best out of my opportunity so that hopefully someday i will be in position to give back. Despite my language and gender and race barrier, i'm a straight A student. What is your excuse? Stop being whiny and work it instead ( may not be true to others but that is my motto).
