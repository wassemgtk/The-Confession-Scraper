I think it's really sad that we don't have more multi-racial relationships on campus. It's unfortunate that a lot of people assume that an individual of another race just won't be attracted to them solely based on their color. The sadder part is that it's sometimes true. I hope that people are more willing to step out of their relationship comfort zone in the future.
