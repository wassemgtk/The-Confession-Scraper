I confess: I am a black person who is fed up with the arguments over white people twerking. Putting Miley Cyrus aside (proving that she messed up does not mean every other non-black who twerks is also messed up. You can't generalize her motives to everyone else), there are a lot of "black" things that aren't reserved for the recreation of black people. For example, is WashU racist for selling chicken and waffles? If you think so, why? Only one culture should be allowed to enjoy something that many people, regardless of race, think is a tasty meal? That's like saying we should get rid of the WUrld fusion or stir fry stations because it's cultural appropriation. A lot of dishes on campus most certainly are cultural appropriation (or maybe I'll say cultural assimilation, since the former carries negative connotations), but no one is complaining. There is not that much of a difference between twerking and chicken and waffles. Both are decidedly considered "Black", yet enjoyed by many blacks and non-blacks; both sometimes carry the connotation of ghetto among non-blacks and yes, among black people too. I mean, let's be honest, a lot of black people on campus have only recently learned how to twerk. Like many trends, twerking has actually existed for a long time but has only recently become "cool". People are acting like twerking is a deeply-rooted aspect of their culture that is being stolen from them, but I ask you: how passionate were you about twerking before it became mainstream? There is definitely still racism at WashU--I'm not arguing that. There's racism everywhere, against many minorities, and the war against it is nowhere near over. But in regard to twerking specifically: Can't we just let it go the way of the cupid shuffle (although it's a lot more sexual, so maybe don't do it at kid parties)? Is it so hard to believe that someone might be unironically interested in a dance rooted in black culture? And if your answer is yes, is it because you are ashamed of your culture, and therefore cannot understand how an outsider could possibly take interest in it? Why do we keep saying things like, "but X was originally for poor black people, and now rich white people are trying to do it too. They don't understand that X stems from suffering and hardship"? Look, a LOT of facets of black culture were originally represented by poor black people because statistically a lot of black families are poor. That's an unfortunate part of our past and present, and something I sincerely wish could change, but we don't need to make poverty a prerequisite for taking part in black culture. Music and dance cross cultural lines so frequently, I'm not even sure why it's an issue. Should we get rid of Jazz at Holmes Lounge because jazz music was created by African Americans? Realize that WUSauce isn't only made up of Latino/Hispanic members. Realize that not everyone in Staam is Jewish. Look at the massive crowds at Diwali and Carnaval. Think about how many people celebrate Holi. Other people are willing to share aspects of their culture, so why not us? If a song or dance moves you, then by all means, let the rhythm carry you.
