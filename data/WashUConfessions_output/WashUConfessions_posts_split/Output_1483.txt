I have been struggling with anxiety and depression for all 4 years that I've been here and I do take medicine and go to therapy weekly, sometimes twice weekly. Even with all that I still have my bad days, especially if triggered by someone saying something to me or if I'm especially swamped at school. Due to this, I have to take things easy sometimes, but I'm tired of people who don't know me very well sneering at my lighter course load or when I have to miss class or meetings because I just can't bring myself to get out of bed or show my face in public. And when these people judge me or talk behind my back and I hear about it, or if they even say off-hand comments at me, it just makes everything so much worse. I'm glad you are Type A and just got into med school and working two jobs, or if you're struggling with depression too and doing a good job, you can't judge me or my life choices. Just remember that next time you give someone shit or act like you're so high and mighty. We all wake up in the morning trying to do our best and give it our all, and some people just have a harder time of that than others.
