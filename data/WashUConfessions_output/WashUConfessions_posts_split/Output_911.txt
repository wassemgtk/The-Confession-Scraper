To people who struggle with depression,

I know it's hard. I've suffered from depression myself. I've battled it since I was eight. In fact, my first attempt at suicide was in fifth grade.

It was really easy for me to give into depression. I had all the reasons to be. My life has been a story where almost everyone can hear and say "wow, you've had it really rough."

My father ran out on my mom and me when I was six. All I remember about him is how he used to beat up my mom. We'd always been poor but our livelihood got harder after he abandoned us. My mom soon became an alcoholic. She didn't really think about supporting me. It's not that she didn't love me. She was too broken to care.

When I was the angriest girl who thought life couldn't get any worse, my mom remarried a man who would sexually harass and abuse me till this day. When I was as self-conscious as an adolescent girl could be about her changing body, my stepfather would ask specific questions pertaining to my body. He once demanded that he see me naked. Needless to say, he would touch me in the most inappropriate areas.

Now I am back home for the summer and that despicable monster is still living with my mom. He tried to brush his hands against my inner thighs. I had to grab his hands and push them away because he wouldn't stop when I told him to. (I know I need to put an end to this but I am too traumatized and ashamed to reveal this without anonymity and seek help).

And yet, despite all these things, I've refused to slip back into depression for the past two -- I would say I overcame depression senior year of high school. And the most important realization that has help me overcome depression is this: It's not going to stop till you wise up. Your environment for which you blame your depression for won't change easily. It'll persist. And even when your current environment changes, there will be other obstacles that will sling you back into depression. You CANNOT let your environment deprive you of your right to be happy and enjoy life. Don't wait on the world to change. Make yourself stronger. I did it. So can you.
