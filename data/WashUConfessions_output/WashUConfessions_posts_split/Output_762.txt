Hey kiddos, take advantage of all your friendship-promoting resources you have at a fine school like this. Like clubs. and living near people. and being within walking distance of everyone and everything. Going to places where peers will always be, whispers, the DUC, BD, Seoul Taco etc. I used to have real life friends, like people I know, who know me, that I could say hi to and stuff. And then I graduated and moved, new job, no friends in the world outside of it. oh well.
