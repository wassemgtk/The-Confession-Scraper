At the beginning of the summer as I was finishing up my workout, I saw a guy walk in the AC. I'm assuming that was his first time there - he was pretty small, having trouble benching just the bar, couldn't even do a single squat, and had an embarassed expression as he glanced at the guys around him lifting. I walked out to go home and didn't think much of the encounter at the time, but he became a familiar face in the weight room over the next few weeks. I still see him come in a couple times every week near the end of my workout. He's gotten a little (but noticeably) bigger, I see him squatting nearly two plates on each side now, and I see no trace of the self-consciousness that he had 6 months ago. 

I don't know your name, but I would like to shake your hand for taking the initiative to improve your body and not giving up when you were intimidated by those who could lift 5 times more than you.

This is a great example for anyone else who doesn't think they can become fit, or are afraid of being judged while exercising. Plus, most of the strangers in the gym either too busy to judge or even silently cheering you on - those who are actually judging you, screw them who cares what those assholes think. Just dedicate an hour three times a week, eat right, find the right program, ask friends for help, and you won't believe how much your life can change in a few months.
