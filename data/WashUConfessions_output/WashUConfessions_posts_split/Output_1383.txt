Wash U alumni and current medical student....honestly loved every minute of being pre med at wash u.. nothing feels better than having made it when so many others have failed. People need to stop bitching about grades, put their heads down, and work. If you're concerned about your GPA, be a psych major, it has worked for every girl that has gotten into med school from wash u, lol, and you know what the kicker is...I got into a top 20 US-MD med school despite having a GPA of 3.09, honestly wash u kids don't give themselves enough credit, and are way to quick to just throw in the towel!
