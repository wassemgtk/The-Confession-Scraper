I'm a freshman and I feel really overwhelmed. Or underwhelmed. I don't know. Wash U wasn't my first choice, but it was up there, and now that I'm here I can't help feeling like it wasn't a good match, like somehow I don't deserve it or it doesn't deserve me. I've set goals that I can strive for here and people seem really cool and I've been happy with pretty much everything I've done so far, so I'm not sure what's causing this feeling. :(
