My boyfriend is twice my size. And 5 times as strong. When I get upset at him I hit him .. A lot... He doesn't hit back because he doesn't want to hurt me.. But I think this is abuse.. I think I need anger management. I do actually hurt him sometimes. This is for anyone who believes men can't be physically abused by women in a relationship.
