Re: #3185 (Baby Carrots)

Is it just me, or do baby carrots taste exactly like regular carrots, except they are:

A) smaller
B) more expensive
C) terrible for our environment

Like, aside from the fact that baby carrots are directly linked with polar bear deaths, why would someone like them in the first place? I never hear someone say they like little sandwiches, they just like sandwiches... (Though, to be fair, mini m&ms are waaaaaaaay better than regular m&ms...)

Honestly, baby carrot are like Ultimate Frisbee players to me: Frisbee players pretend to play some cool niche sport, when it's really just either glorified handball or dumbed-down football (side note: the word "Ultimate" has no place in "Ultimate Frisbee"). In the same vein, baby carrots pretend to be some special niche case of vegetable, when their just environmentally harmful carrots.
