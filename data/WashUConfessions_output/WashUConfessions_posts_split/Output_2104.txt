Over the past few years, I have realized my best friend has a habit of taking food without asking (especially if it's in a common space), or asking for food to be shared when those people (or I) had no intention of sharing it. It's a habit that I find incredibly rude, and I've tried nicely mentioning the issue when it pertains to me. Nothing has changed. It's a habit that turns me off a lot, and I'm starting to develop a disgust for my friend a little bit more each time I see it. I know it should be an issue that doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things, but I can't let it go.
