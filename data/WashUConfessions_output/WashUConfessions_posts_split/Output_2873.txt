I am an Undergraduate TA for a class on campus. I wish people understood how much time I sacrifice to help students do better in class, and how I go out of my way. I usually do not expect anything back, but it hurts when students judge TAs, etc. for how well they might be of use. YOU are the one who ultimately decides how much you will get out of the opportunities that you are given. Don't show up without questions and then say a Q&A review or office hours were useless, because the real point of these is to FIX your confusion if you have any, not be another lecture to teach you the "secret answers or explanations" to the tests or exams. Prepare early, work smart and hard, and use your resources. There is no reason why the majority of students at WashU can't get As in all their classes. People say the Premed program is way too hard... No it's not “too hard”... It's very doable actually. You just need to plan accordingly and prioritize studying (note: this doesn't mean ONLY study... do some extracurricular activities, go shadow, volunteer, etc.). Try different ways to study and find ways that work for YOU, and learn that way. On a different note, if you go to parties every weekend, you shouldn't complain about work. Parties are for celebrations. If you have nothing to celebrate and have a lot of work that needs to be other, why the hell are you partying/drinking? Just reflect on what you do and what are your habits, and cut out those things that waste so much of your time that you will never get back. Sorry if this turned into a lecture but students tend to realize how doable the majority of their classes were until it’s too late.
