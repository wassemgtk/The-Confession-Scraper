I've been wanting to get this off my chest for a while but haven't known exactly how to say it until now.

When I was little I was spanked on a regular basis by my quite muscular dad on a regular basis, at my mom's request, even for small things such as spilling milk. My mom was fundamentalist and got angry with my grandma when she gave me a pack of Pokémon cards at age 6, because Pokémon is short for Pocket Monsters and monsters were evil (along with aliens, witches, ghosts, zombies, and magic powers). She would often rip pages out of magazines before giving them to me, not even letting me see the back of the page, because of "demonic" content such as a Harry Potter ad.

I was homeschooled all of K-12 even though I wished to be in a more typical setting and frequently made said wishes known verbally. My only real chances at socialization in my earlier years was a weekly church service, and my mom's reasoning for keeping me homeschooled (as opposed to a Christian private school) was that I was "inexperienced in dealing with other people".

My biggest desire until age 12 was to be on a Little League team (my dad had been in the minor leagues and I looked up to him). I asked my parents many times, even offering to pay the $300 fee myself with money I had saved up for years from gifts from my grandma, but was denied due to being "inexperienced socially". Instead my mom took away my favorite video games (all E-rated, another of her demands which continued well into my teenage years) and didn't give them back for as long as 4 years. Everything seemed fine on the outside, but that was just because the few times I saw other kids I was so excited at the relative freedom that I literally couldn't be sad. But when I got home I would cry myself to sleep, wishing I could be anyone else.

I got my family's old computer put in my room at 13 and promptly went around their parental control system. I would still go "on the radar" and go to an a site they approved of a couple of times a day so my parents would see it on their e-mail record. About every hour my mom would walk into my room and I would have to go to Task Manager and even occasionally pull an intentional BSOD.

The next year my mom changed churches because the youth group was too "worldly" with their mentions of Myspace and YouTube. A month later my favorite MMO virtual world (a very family-friendly one that she approved of) closed down. With most of my video games still gone and most of my avenues for contact with others demolished, I attempted suicide twice but failed.

When I was 16 I was removed from my last social group (a homeschooling co-op) because my mom hated that grades K-12 were all together (it was "just wrong", she said). For the next 2.5 years, I saw no friends in real life and had problems focusing and severe brain fog along with total emotionlessness outside of a constant listless sadness. At times I would read anger-inducing websites for many hours just to experience a few seconds of SOME kind of emotion.

My mom wanted me to go to a local religious university, but I had higher ideals. I was able to push through my brain fog enough to learn computer programming and suggest to my mom that my résumé might look better if I did a science project. This project was intentionally security-related to aid me in my secondary plan -- to get my mom to stop watching me on the computer. I convinced her (without saying any words to this affect at all) that I was doing a very important project on the side for the government and nobody could see me do it. Luckily it worked, and she never found out about the glitch in the parental controls.

I actually WAS doing a side project, but not for the government -- instead I worked from 5 AM to midnight every weekday to do school (I sped up the DVDs to save time), study for the SAT/ACT, begin to fill out college applications, and (mostly) work on a major web programming project that would boost my résumé and make me some money. After getting perfect scores on my entrance exams, my parents (mostly at my dad's urging) started to look at actually decent universities for me.

Luckily, I got into some of them -- including Wash U, which I am now attending. I feel a lot happier here on occasion, even though it's taken me years to adjust to the relative culture shock of no longer being in the bubble I was raised in. Still, nothing is perfect... all those years of pretending to be hiding something while actually hiding something else have gotten so deep into me that I developed pretty bad social anxiety, and the intensity of my course load doesn't help with that (when I'm actually busy, I often say no to things and then worry that the person thought I didn't want to be with them). Also, all the time of my parents berating me for every little thing has resulted in me being very afraid and paranoid of doing anything remotely "rebellious" or anything I'm not already good at, even though I personally want to live a more exciting life, and sadly my paranoia has probably led a lot of people to think I'm personally strongly conservative when actually I just have a lot of irrational fears rooted from a time when going even a little bit "wild" would have resulted in serious harm to me.

Up until now, I have only told one friend about all of this -- I even avoided telling my grandmother when she babysat me as a kid out of fear that my parents would punish me for doing so (which they had specifically threatened to do if I said anything). Incidentally, my mom still claims credit for getting me into Wash U, even though her plans would have prevented me in multiple ways from coming here.
