I confess that I love SPB's choices of artists for Fall WILD. Oftentimes I've sensed an attitude of overall complaint towards the WILD artist choice, and this semester is no exception... but the truth is, most people probably don't dislike the choice, but the ones that do love it often don't care enough to say so. Thanks for making the past few WILDs awesome, and keep on keepin' on, no matter what the haters say.
