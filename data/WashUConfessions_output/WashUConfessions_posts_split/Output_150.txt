I confess I found the confession about the parents not seeing the graduation hilarious. I mean, the idea of foreigners flying thousands of miles only to end up watching some grainy feed of the real deal is so pathetically good it's like a sitcom plot.

I also confess that I think I might be a psychopath. Like the classic psychos I do social shit and am pretty 'charming', but I can't get beyond the feeling that most people are just pathetic and trivial as fuck.
