I don't get my self-worth from foolish places. I don't need a guy to make me feel good. I don't need the popular girls to think I'm cool. No, that's not for me. I know if I'm doing a good job at life based on how many likes I get on Yahoo, how many comments I get on facebook, and how many reblogs I get on Tumblr.
