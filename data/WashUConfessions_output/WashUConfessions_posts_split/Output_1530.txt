I've always been comfortably well off, financially. I've never had to work a part time job, and I've never been tied down or held back for financial reasons. My one duty in life has been to study, and I've done a decent enough job at it. But this year, for some various reasons, I decided to cut off a large portion of my pocket money from myself. My family is still very well off, but in terms of immediate money that I can use for my own personal benefit, whenever and on whatever I want, I have very little. It's opened my eyes up to a whole new lifestyle. I can no longer "treat myself" if I'm having a bad day - I have to consider, will spending all that money really fix my problem? Is it worth losing $20 just to make myself "feel better", or is that just some sort of shallow dream that I can overcome? I find myself saving on so many things I used to fearlessly indulge in.

It really is so amazing to take a step back and have the opportunity to show myself what a spoiled person I was. I don't think (or I guess, I don't hope) that I'm a rotten person, nor do I think I'm particularly ignorant about money. But this experience has just taught me so much about my own lifestyle, and my money managing habits. Although it's super stressful for me to have to pick and choose what's worth my money, it has also been incredibly liberating. I don't quite understand why a restriction of money makes me feel liberated, but it really does. It makes me want to change myself. It makes me cherish what I buy, it forces me to thoroughly think through a purchase, and (most of all), it really makes me appreciate each and every single person who works their ass off at any job anywhere just to earn a little bit of green. I hope that someday I'll be able to go back to that comfortable spending lifestyle, only with money that I've earned by my own hands.
