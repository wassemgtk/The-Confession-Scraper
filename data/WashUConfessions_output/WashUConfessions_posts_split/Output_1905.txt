My family raised me as a religious person. I even followed my religion during my Freshman year in college, but after all of the pain I went through my third semester and also seeing the suffering in the world, it's now safe to say I don't believe in god anymore. Why would anyone cause people to suffer this much? If said God actually cared about everyone why would he ever make anyone suffer? Why are there this many injustices in the world if he could stop them?

I don't want to stop believing, but I just can't anymore.
