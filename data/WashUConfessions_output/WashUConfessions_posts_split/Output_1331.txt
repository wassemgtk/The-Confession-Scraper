As an upperclassman, I've realized that it's harder to make new friends because everyone is already settled into their friend groups. I have a solid friend group but I'm always down to make some more friends. There are so many cool people at WashU that I haven't met because our paths haven't crossed yet. I guess what  I'm trying to say is that the next time a stranger talks to you in class or an acquaintance asks you to hang out, don't brush them off- see it as an opportunity to make a new friend!
