I've made a really good friendship in my first semester here, and I've never been so close with another person in such a short amount of time. However, I'm so scared I'm going to lose my new friend to Greek life--he'll replace me with all his frat brothers and he won't have time to hang out with me anymore because of his new family. Has anyone else experienced this, and can anyone speak to whether my feelings are genuine concerns or just fake fears? It just seems like Greek life takes over a person's entire life, and I hate that.
