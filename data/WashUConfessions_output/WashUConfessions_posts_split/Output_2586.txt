When will the far radical left movement at Wash U have enough? I generally agree with issues and the theories that they have regarding feminism, social justice etc, however, it seems like they often go too far in their beliefs to the point where they look down on anyone who doesn't share their beliefs or doesn't tolerate opposing beliefs because they, by definition must be hateful.

The last time I checked, Wash U is an academic institution, which I thought meant had an open area for free thought and for a litany of varying viewpoints; however, I find it as a place of repression by those with the most radical viewpoints creating a culture where it is hard for others to speak up or even want to talk about issues, assuming it is not within the orthodoxy of liberal beliefs. Ironically, this is the same thing that the tea party has been criticized of by the left but I digress.

I am not criticizing any single person or organization, but we need to do better  as an entire school. Realizing this is a good first step.
