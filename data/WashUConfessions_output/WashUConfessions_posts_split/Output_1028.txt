PSA: While I enjoy the caffeine posts, I thought it worth to note that you can overdose on caffeine.  In high school one night, I once had a big mountain dew and a couple big rooster boosters from the gas station fountain, and later stirred crushed up caffeine pills into a coffee.  Later, my heart fluttering about and hands shaking, I realized there is a limit to how much caffeine you should consume in a night.  Good luck out there!

By the way, if you are unfortunate enough to find yourself in this state a literal wall will materialize, strike your mental, and sap all your energy in an instant.  (Also, you probably won't study that much)
