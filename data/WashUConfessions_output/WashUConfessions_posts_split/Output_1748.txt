To dudes who are about to start rushing and worried about keeping friends:

My freshman year, my worst fear was that all my friends would get into fraternities, but I wouldn't, causing me to lose all my friends with whom I had worked so hard to form a relationship. Then, my worst fear was realized, but only the first half. Most of my friends got into a fraternity, but I did not. (There were others who did not, but they joined in following semesters.) Because of this, I spent a large portion of my freshman year in a terrible mental state, to the point of attempting suicide.

I realize now, and want to tell anyone in the same position, that just because your friends are all in fraternities and you are not, doesn't mean you will lose them as friends. Sure, you won't see them a lot (or even at all in some cases) during pledging, and it can be a bit of work to maintain friendships at the time, but in the long run, you'll stay close with your close friends. Now I'm a junior, and just about every single one of my male friends is in a fraternity. But I'm still very close with them, and actually made more friends through the fraternity. There are definitely times where it can get lonely, but I also have made a few fellow GDI friends with whom I also became very close.

My point is: it can seem awful at the time and like you'll lose friends, but you'll keep the ones who are very close. Plus, you could make even more friends out of it! Stick through this rough patch, because at the end of the semester, when they're done pledging, you'll see them just as much as you used to (perhaps more). Just keep your head up!
