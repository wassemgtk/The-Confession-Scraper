The other day I had the unexpected honor of being kicked out of an exec board of a cultural student group. And do you want to know the worst part about being kicked out of a group? It's being kicked out and no one having the decency to tell you this to your face. I didn't find out I was kicked out of the group until I contacted the exec president after I noticed that I was removed from both the exec Facebook chat group and the Facebook exec page.

Now you may ask yourself- what could I possibly have done to deserve this? Surely, such swift and complete action would only be warranted by some sort of grievous transgression on my part. You would think that, right? But no. I didn't do anything wrong. In fact I did a lot of stuff right. When we had events who was almost always there? I was. When we had the activity fair last fall who was the person who set up the table and chairs? It was me. And when I couldn't be there it was for a darn good reason. Like I had a class. You know, the things we're supposed to go to so we get an education?

When I contacted the president to ask what was going on the only thing she could say was that she was sorry. Some members felt that I "wasn't contributing as significantly as they were". Which is sort of funny since one member of the exec board (who's still there by the way) was studying abroad last semester. So I know that at least last semester I was contributing a heck of a lot more than he was. And yet I'm still the one to get axed. I knew when I spoke with the president that her explanation was groundless. The truth is actually quite simple. I didn't fit in and so the other members decided they didn't want me anymore. You see most of the other members of my former exec board are pretty extroverted. I, on the other hand, tend to be rather quiet. I'm betting that they decided that I wasn't as "fun" of an exec member as they wanted so they got rid of me to make room for their friends or for people "like them" to join. There is also the possibility that my race may have something to do with it. It hasn't escaped my notice that the only person kicked out of the group is also the only person of a different race than any of the other exec members.

Now, you may wonder why am I even bothering with this post. I should just move on and let this go. In the real world people get fired or kicked out of groups or excluded for all sorts of petty reasons. Why am I making such a big deal out of it? The answer to that is simple: I'm tired. In the several (i.e. more than 4) years that I've been a Wash U student I've witnessed case after case of favoritism play out in various student groups and in various performances. I've seen and been one of the more than qualified students who has been passed over for a spot or a position so that a friend of an exec member or choreographer or interviewer can get the position. I just can't be quiet about it anymore. The nepotism has got to stop people! I know that this sort of stuff goes on in the real world. And I should be prepared for it. But I guess I just hoped that Wash U would be a fairer place than that. It should be a fairer place than that. And if it's not then there should be somewhere where we can address this issue. I'm writing this here because I know of no place else to go where I feel like complaints against student groups will be heard. If you guys know someone that I could contact, please comment that below.

The last words that I heard from my ex exec board president were that she's "sorry". Well, I think she should be. I know I am.
