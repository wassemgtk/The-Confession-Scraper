Seeing all these posts from depressed/lonely upperclassmen makes me feel better, because it lets me know that I'm not alone and that others feel the same way I do. I thought I was the only freshman who didn't have friends and pretty much hated life, but now I have hope that there are others out there and that it probably won't go away!
