Senate will be tabling in the DUC today from 11 AM to 2 PM for students to write thank you notes to the custodial workers on main campus. These people work incredibly hard to keep the school clean and I believe this gesture of appreciation would mean a lot to them.

(For the record, I'm not affiliated with the Senate or this event.)
