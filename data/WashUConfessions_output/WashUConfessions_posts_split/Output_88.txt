Back when I was a teenager, I was trans. I hated my body, didn't feel that it was right, and repeatedly talked with my parents about getting a sex-change operation. They were supportive, but told me that I should see a psychologist first, and if I still was certain at the end of eight months or so, they would get me in for the operation. And you know what? Damned if they weren't right. Turns out hormones are weird things. Every day I'm thankful to them for saving me from what would surely have been hell otherwise.
