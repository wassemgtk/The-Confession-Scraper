One of my favorite professors left for another school a while back. I’m not sure why, but I really miss him, much more than I thought I would. I miss taking his classes, and the way he made his subject the most interesting thing in the world. Beyond a doubt, he inspired my love for his subject, and it was his classes that persuaded me to choose my minor. He was incredibly inspirational to me, and showed me how amazing the universe can be. I regret that I never got to know him better. I never seemed to have time to go to his office hours, or meet outside of class. I always figured there would be time for that later. I’ve considered reaching out to him several times, but I’m nervous about it, and I don't know if I should. I doubt he’d remember me—I was just one face in a lecture hall of 100 students. It makes me a little sad that he probably has no idea what a huge impact he had on my education, or how inspirational he was to me and to others.
