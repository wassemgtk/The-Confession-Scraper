I’m having somewhat of a mid-undergrad crisis.  Ever since I was little and saw the health problems my parents faced I’ve imagined being a doctor.  I came to WashU fully intending to study Chemistry on a pre-med track (and, as a rising junior, that is still the plan).  However, recently I’ve found myself pulled in another direction entirely.  I started sophomore year by joining an a cappella group as well as taking some courses for a Music minor; I have a lot of experience with the piano so the music wasn’t anything new, but the acting and singing of a cappella and some WashU singing courses gave me a new appreciation for the art of music.  My voice teacher has encouraged me to pursue this kind of thing further, and I’ve realized that nothing would make me happier.  I can’t help but feel guilty, though, when I think about the selfless intentions that made me set out on the pre-med track; my problem is that I don’t know how to finish out my time at WashU in a way that satisfies all these selfless goals while making me truly happy.
