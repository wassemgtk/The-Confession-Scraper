Yesterday night I was called a n***** for the first time in my life by some Wash U students at an off campus party. Originally I was planning to respond physically or verbally, but I then decided to just go home and let ignorant people enjoy their sad existence. I write this not only to vent, but also to show that race is obviously still an issue at Wash U and pretending it isn't is a great injustice to many students. I hope in the coming years, other Wash U students won't have to deal with what I've dealt with in the Wash U community.
