I'm sure there will be an abundance of confessions with regards to the protest in Olin today, but please, I beg you, read this and consider what I am saying. I apologize for the length.

I was working at the library when the protesters came storming in, with drums and screaming; there seemed to be about 400 people in the crowd. I tried to hold on as long as I could, hoping it would go away soon, but it became too much. I ran (getting pushed down by a protester without even a glance my way or an apology) into the girl's bathroom and fell down to my knees in a fit of panic in one of the stalls. I was having a panic attack, induced by the crowd of protesters. I spent 20 minutes in the fetal position on the bathroom stall floor, tears running down my face.

Now many of you probably do not know what a panic attack is. Have you ever felt like someone had their hands on your neck, choking you? Have you ever felt what it feels like to drown? With panic attacks, most people cannot breathe. I physically couldn't breathe - I was alternately hyperventilating and choking. My entire body was shaking. And the phrase "I'm dying, I'm dying, please help me," was running through my head over and over again like a broken soundtrack.

Three or four women came into the bathroom and they could hear me. One whispered to her friend about "crazy crying bitches" and the other one came in later, and although my panic attack and pleas for help were clearly heard, she said nothing and left.

I fully support the protests going on, and I saw the Facebook event about the one today. But I had no idea it would be in the library, where I was. The whole point of the protest is to fight for the rights of every single person, and yet as a person myself, no one bothered to help me. I was alone.

Quite frankly, I am upset that I (along with most everyone else) was unaware that the protest would occur in the library. I feel that it was inconsiderate, because no one stopped to think - a library is a quiet place, where many students like me come to so that we can avoid riots and protests and large crowds, the things that trigger us to have panic attacks. I have a friend who tutors autistic children in the library - what would have happened if they were there? And at least 5 people saw or heard me in the midst of my panic attack, and no one cared enough to ask me if I was okay or needed help.
