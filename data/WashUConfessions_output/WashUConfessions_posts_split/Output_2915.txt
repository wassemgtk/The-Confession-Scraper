Dear University, (I confess that..) I believe if someone who has a brunch bracelet is sharing food with someone who does not have a bracelet, slap them with a $25 fine to cover your lost revenue. The fact that you get a Judicial Referral with several sanctions and some long moral talk is a complete joke and a waste of resources. I am from the Chicagoland area and I want to draw upon the analogous example of decriminalizing marijuana. Instead of having to take the case to trial (Judicial Referral? ahem) which wastes many resources such as cops having to come to court, along with prosectors and judges who could be doing something more important, they simply hand the person a fine and thats that. Just like people in Chicago were thrown in jail and had their crime on their permanent record, WashU students have to report this robbery of an omelette to med schools, law schools, etc. which they apply to, which greatly hurts their application. Given the fact that the number of people taking mental health leaves has more than doubled in the last few years here at the university, why dont you allocate more of your resources towards that area? We dont need to talk to judiciary people to hear them spew a moral talk on us and be put on probation by the university because you call sharing an omelette "theft". You let us in to your university for a reason. You thought we were bright students who were compassionate, and future leaders of the world. We still are. My point is you should not demonize us for something I have seen countless (hundreds) of students do during my four years at WashU. If so many of your students are committing the crime of "theft" (apples and omelettes and eggs, oh my), why dont you try and look at the larger problem, like why they might be doing so. Is it perhaps because your food prices are absurdly high for many of the poor students who make up the WashU community? I only suggest that you quit with your normal reaction to every problem that happens on WashU's campus which is punish students, and instead find a solution.
