I am ready for a serious relationship. I have never been anything but single and am looking to meet the love of my life. Sometimes I feel like everyone else I know is in a relationship and I can't say I don't wish I was too. While I have lots of friends, I feel like I'm missing out on something. I wish I would be asked out more.
