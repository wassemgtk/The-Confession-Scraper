I confess that I think everyone just needs to stop and think for a minute. Both the "social justice warriors" and those who hate on them. Think about it: what are you really doing? The answer, as far as I can see it, is trying to repress each other. "Social justice warriors," why can I not disagree with you? Why do I need to agree with you to feel like a decent person in your presence? And for those who disagree, on what grounds? SHOW that maybe they aren't right, rather than just saying it. And do it without disparaging people. It's hard to agree with either of you if you can't just agree to disagree, without trying to "convert" each other. Honestly I feel like both groups are being unreasonable because neither group can seem to stand disagreement. Can't we just try not to be dicks to each other? Seems easy enough to me.
