I confess that I don't deny my sexuality, but I'm not very "in your face" about it either. Not too many people on campus know I'm gay, but that's just because the topic really hasn't come up. I can't seem to find a way to make it a part of my life without announcing it in a way that makes it a bigger deal than it is, but I want to find more ways to be out and visible.
