My roommate snores so loudly that it keeps me up for hours at night. Even with headphones in, I can still hear her half the time. I don't know how to bring this up with her, or if I even should. For now, I'm anxiously awaiting Thanksgiving break, when I might be able to actually get a full night's sleep.
