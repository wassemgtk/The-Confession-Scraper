I constantly hear and read about how people feel like they are giving into depression or stress, and it seems like everyone I know has gone through periods such as these. I try to relate, I really do, but I've never felt like that before. Don't get me wrong, I've been stressed, but it's typically about some assignment or test or something similar that as soon as I manage to finish it, the stress is relieved. I know that it's a good thing that I don't have depression or anxiety or the like, but sometimes I feel bad that I haven't when it seems as if everyone else has. 

I was dating a girl this summer who is literally the nicest person I have ever met. I found out a little while into the relationship that she had depression, has contemplated suicide and used to cut herself. I was absolutely shocked. She kept telling me that she appreciated how much I understood her and how well I could comfort her, but truthfully, I really couldn't understand. I've always tried to be optimistic, and that's the attitude I was presenting to her. I know I shouldn't, but that is what really makes me feel bad about never having those emotions before. 

Why is it fair that the sweetest person I know has to have experienced that while I get to coast through life without ever experiencing these traumas that seem so common?
