Unique ways to keep warm when your parents are cutting back on the energy bill...
1) Dont go to the bathroom without socks,  the floor is too damn cold. Simple.  We all know this.
2) Make quesadilla. When finished, hover the pan a few inches from your face and neck, it is glorious I promise.
3) Dry laundry on hot setting. Throw hot pile on bed. Lay on pile until toasty. Leave laundry for someone else to do.
4) Grab dog or cat and use their warmth. Ignore annoyed growls or hissing. You're too cold to care.
5) Lie under beanbag chair(s), after a while your warmth will insulate really well under there. Kind of like a crude synthetic sleeping bag
6) Put laptop on lap. Download hella shit while watching netflix until your lap is toasty. Who cares about gonads overheating or whatever
7) Dress so heavily in the house that it becomes a passive aggressive attack on your parents not using the heater.
8) Play wii sports with friends to get the blood pumping.
9) Pack your bags and go back to washu, where you can use the heat as much as you damn please with heaters that even on low winter setting seem to want to make your furniture spontaneously combust.
