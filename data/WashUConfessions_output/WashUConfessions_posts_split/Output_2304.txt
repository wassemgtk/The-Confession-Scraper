I met a European friend on some penpal website 2 years and 9.5 months ago, and we've been chatting and writing messages to each other on a semi-regular basis.

At the beginning we used to talk quite often but lately we've been talking less as she's gotten very busy with work, which I'm cool with. The problem for me emerged when I noticed she's online multiple times a day almost daily, but it usually takes at least 2-3 days (often up to a week) for her to answer something that would only take a couple minutes. I asked her about it, and got no answer back.

I haven't socialised a lot so my idea of "friends" may not be close to what's been socially accepted. But I feel like one would usually want to hang out with/talk to their friends as often as possible.

Yesterday I had only enough time to just bring this up, and she said she considered me as a friend but she didn't mind if I considered as a mere acquaintance. That I believe isn't characteristic of a friend, and I somehow think that she's deceiving herself into thinking I'm her friend, but deep down I only happen to be someone she knows well. Which makes sense because we've never met in person.

But I'm also thinking I may have gotten this idea of "friends" all wrong and maybe I'm overreacting. I wish I never thought of all this in the first place because she's the one I got closest to in the past 8 years, and it helped me survive Wash U without friends.
