Given my newsfeed lately, it seems like every sorority is just trying to out-Tumblr each other before rush. Pretty pathetic that that's what they use to try to illustrate a certain "image" to freshmen to make their sororities look cool as their final push before rush.

P.S. I'm not a Greek life hater. I'm in a sorority that does this same exact thing.
