As someone who suffers from several anxiety disorders, reading all of these statuses about depression and self-doubt really ring true for me. Still, if I could get through the shit show that was last summer — literally, ALL of the shit hit ALL of the fans at once, and I had to check myself into the ER for suicide watch not once, not twice, but three times — I believe that y'all can get through this. I'm still struggling, but I'm in a better place right now. Every day I'm able to find something that makes me happy to be alive, even if it's just a really good croissant during a class that makes me want to gouge my eyes out.... Anyway,  I have faith in you guys, and, even if it doesn't feel like it, your RAs, your professors, that random guy in Whispers, and the people around you (even if they feel like complete strangers) are there for you.  So — hugs. Hugs for everyone.
