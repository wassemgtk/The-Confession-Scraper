I saw Chancellor Wrighton walking his dog one evening, and his dog pooped on the sidewalk without him noticing. When a bystander ran ahead to tell him, I picked up the dropping, squatted down, and took a shit in the same spot. Then I ran across the street to observe, and sure enough, Chancellor Wrighton returned 10 minutes later on a return lap, took a baggie, and picked up the shit. Chancellor Wrighton cleaned up my shit.
