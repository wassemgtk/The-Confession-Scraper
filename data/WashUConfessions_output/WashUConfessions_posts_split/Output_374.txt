I'm probably one of the least sociable people on campus but this is my 4th year coming to Bear's Den every night and two of the staff members have started talking to me.
Given that not a lot of students here even know me, it's surprising and even flattering that some staff members have gotten to know me, at least to recognise that I exist.
