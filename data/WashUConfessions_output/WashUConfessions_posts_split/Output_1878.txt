I confess that my motives for going to the gym and lifting haven't been exactly feminist. I used to go lift to see guys. And so that guys could see me. But recently, I've felt so empowered lifting weights.  I love feeling sore the next morning and feeling like I'm growing. I feel like a freakin man (without looking like one) and it's amazing. Girls, I encourage you to go lift. Being in a testosterone-filled room has more perks than you'd think.
