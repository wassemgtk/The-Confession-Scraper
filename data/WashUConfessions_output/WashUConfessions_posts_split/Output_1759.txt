As someone who plans to pursue an academic career (aka go to grad school, become postdoc and assistant prof and so on and so on), I feel isolated in WashU where most people of my major are premed. Things got worse when my parents "accidentally" mentioned in front of you that a kid of a family friend majors in Comp Sci and got an intern at Microsoft or Amazon with 7000 dollar a month, whereas I worked my ass off during the semester in a research lab (I can work up to 20 hours per week sometimes with a huge course workload) and got a bit more than minimum wage. Sometimes at midnight I cannot fall asleep, because there are lots of questions whirling in my head: Do I even have the abilities to eventually fulfill my academic dreams? I don't think I am smart enough! Or should I follow other people and do what is most lucrative? But it is too late for me to change, and unfortunately I don't have interest for comp sci or business or whatever...Anyway I kinda just want to know I am not alone.
