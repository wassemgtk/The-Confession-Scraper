Even though I come from an upper middle class background, I feel a huge economic gap between my friends and me. I work a lot and am constantly worrying about money and how much things cost. This is all on top of a very generous financial aid package I'm perpetually terrified of losing. Meanwhile most of my friends didn't even apply for aid, constantly go out to eat, and don't hold jobs. It sucks having to limit how much I hang out with then based on costs. I have no idea how students from low socioeconomic backgrounds handle it here.
