As a participant in CGI-U this weekend, I was walking past frat row with hundreds of other participants (from all 50 states and 75 countries) when some frat brothers hanging out in the Kappa Sig patio started yelling juvenile insults like "NERDS" and "WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?" Not only was it stupid and childish, but it was an extremely poor way to represent this university to 1,000 students who are going to judge WashU and tell other people about it based on the weekend that they spent here. Whoever you are, you may think that's funny, and that the students walking by were "nerds", but they are also some of the most amazing people I have ever met. These students are doing everything from curing rampant infant diseases in developing countries to providing an education to children who don't have access to one to recycling materials into beds for the homeless. They're not just talking about these things, they're DOING THEM. I was humbled by every minute. It's sad because you just yelled your insults at the world leaders of the future, the people who will solve so many of the problems that we face in today's world. The things they are doing are benefitting this world and benefitting YOU and you should appreciate that. You should also be representing WashU to these students in the best possible light, not one of immaturity and lack of consideration. Do better.
