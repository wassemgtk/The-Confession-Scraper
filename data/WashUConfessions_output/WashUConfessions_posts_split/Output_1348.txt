I know that SHS seems to have a bad reputation in regards to their services (especially mental health services), but I wanted to confess that I have been genuinely astounded this past week at how dedicated they were and still are to helping me solve my own medical problems.

Disclaimer: I did not go to SHS for their mental health services, so I can't speak to that. Also, my story may not be representative of the general attitudes of SHS patients, it really is just one case study.

However, I do want to share my SHS story. I went to go to see a doctor because of concerns of lumps and nodes being in places they shouldn't be. I made an appointment and was seen within a week of calling. I was initially hoping to just be referred to Barnes, because I didn't think SHS would have the staff or training required for my problem (I also didn't have the confidence that SHS would be professional enough to take me seriously, as my home doctor told me nothing was wrong despite my atypical symptoms).

Lo and behold, the doctor the nurses signed me up for was a specialist for my exact problem. At SHS. No Barnes needed (for now at least). She was very professional and got me in for some blood testing that very day, and a scan later this week. As results have been coming in from the blood tests, she and I have been emailing back and forth EVERY DAY to discuss my options, going to Barnes, getting a biopsy, what treatment SHS can offer with its more convenient location, etc. She's creating a team of doctors for me to be properly treated. Unlike my home doctor, she took me seriously, did the necessary tests, and found out that something was wrong and I wasn't just "exaggerating" or "making up" my symptoms (really not a fan of home doctor at this point, if you can't tell). Did I mention this doctor, who I've only ever met that once, has been in contact with me EVERY DAY since my appointment?? I've gotten emails back from her before 8am to after 7pm when she really doesn't have to be working. This lady is amazing. I just want to give all of SHS a huge round of applause, for meeting my health needs and for going above and beyond to make me feel comfortable, safe, and confident in their skills of diagnosing and treating me.

SHS really is, in my experience, much better than I had been led to believe by their general reputation. Thank you, staff at SHS, for putting my mind at ease, taking me seriously as a patient, and working hard for me to become healthy again! I couldn't do this without you!

TLDR: SHS came through for me, doctors there are great, and I'm a happy camper. Hoping other people who are thinking about seeking treatment for anything will give them a chance. They might just surprise you and be 100% awesome doctors, nurses, and staff.
