This isn't a Wash U Specific thing, but I am really annoyed with the apathy/attitude toward piracy here, even more so by people who justify it as a valid way of protesting the movie/music industry or whatever. There is a generally popular opinion, that if someone is making something (album, iPhone game, movie, whatever), and you have heard of them/the product, then they have infinite money. This is really harmful to people who work in these fields, as a lot of them often times have difficulty paying say, rent from month to month. This article, while 3 years old, highlights how difficult it is to make it as an independent music group nowadays.

Ultimately, regardless of what your justification is for it, you're not entitled to any music, book, movie, TV show or whatever you want for free. If you truly have an issue with the way an industry is run, then don't buy it period. We exist in a world of essentially infinite entertainment at any given point so go download a free phone game, or steal your friends netflix password instead.

No one is probably  gonna give a shit but it is so infuriating how often people just feel like piracy is OK. If you're gonna do it fine, but don't try and self-justify yourself and make yourself out to be some sort of good person for doing so.
