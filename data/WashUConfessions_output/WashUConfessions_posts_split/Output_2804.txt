I feel like unless you're smack in the middle of the Midwest, WashU gets no respect. Lots of job recruiters don't have much of an idea what WashU is and seem to often rather hire people from any East or West coast school that has some sort of name recognition ("no, washu's not in seattle or dc"). Like great we're a top 15-20 school in US News, but it would be nice if most people at least knew where the fuck we go to school.
