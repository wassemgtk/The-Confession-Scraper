Does anyone remember a previous confession that explained how Greek “philanthropy” money never actually got donated—it just got reshuffled to support other sororities’ and fraternities’ philanthropy events? As I am participating in rush, I cannot seem to forget about this horrible truth. Or is it a truth? I have been asking around, and receiving varying responses. It's sad that I could not receive a straight answer from any one organization. I'm sure that each Greek organization has its own fair priorities and reasons for how its money is spent, but consider:..if this is truly how Greek philanthropies work, how are so many students content with being members of organizations whose alleged fundamental purpose of service goes unfulfilled? And in the most underhanded manner imaginable?
