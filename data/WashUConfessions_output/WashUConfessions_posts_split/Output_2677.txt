I've never been to a party, and I've never had a drink or smoke or anything. I feel excluded from the WashU community because everyone here seems to party, whether it be all the time or occasionally. I'm just nice and down-to-earth and want to help people... But I can't find anyone like me and I feel like I have no friends. Is it because I am too naive and nice?
