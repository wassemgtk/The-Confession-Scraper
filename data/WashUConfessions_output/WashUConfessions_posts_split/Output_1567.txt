Dear admin, I only asked you if you're the class of 2017 because I was hoping you can reveal yourself when you graduate! You've done so much for our community.. thank you so much for running this page. I bet everyone would love to know who you are bc you're truly wonderful. (ps do u have a date for valentines day???)

===================================

Aw, thanks so much for the kind words!

Actually, since a few people have been asking today about my identity/when I'll graduate, this is probably a good time to mention that I'll likely be stepping down as admin in the future. Not in the immediate future, but sometime down the road before I graduate. 

I love running this page, but the truth is, it can be extremely mentally tolling. Being the admin means I have to meet a lot of contradicting demands from students and student groups across the campus, so I wind up having to pay a price for every decision I make. It also means I have to take blame if someone gets offended by a confession - I've realized that it's easy for people to shift misdirected anger onto an anonymous administrator. 

Aside from that, reading depressing confessions almost every day can be tough. Hell, I lost sleep the other night when I got an actual suicide note as a confession and couldn't do anything about it. (I actually tried, but the truth is, I really had no idea who it came from or how to help them)

Point is, I love running this page and the community that it has built, but I'll likely be stepping down in the future so I can concentrate on my life as regular student. At the very least, I'll be taking a short break in the near future - just for a few days. It'll be a nice chance to get better perspective on my non-admin life anyway! :)
