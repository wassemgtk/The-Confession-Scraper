Even though we've already spent a summer apart and I know the three months will pass by before I know it, sometimes when I really miss my boyfriend i'll blow a kiss at the snapchats he sends me. I don't know why I'm embarrassed to admit this to him. Maybe I'll tell him on a random summer day to brighten up his morning!
