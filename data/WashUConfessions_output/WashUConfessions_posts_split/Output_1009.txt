GPA reflections

My lowest GPA semester also had the least credit hours. My highest GPA semesters had the most credit hours. My excitement about the classes I was taking corresponded really well with my performance, go figure.

take whatever the heck classes YOU want to take, don't listen to advisors if you don't believe them. you know yourself better and your peers know the classes better, advisors only gonna lead you astray. If you want to take a class do it, if you really want it you'll pull it off.

And required classes suck sometimes, but if you have something fun in your schedule at least it will bring you joy.

also no one even reads your GPA at your funeral, so I would not bother worrying about it
