I really don't want the semester to start... I remember i used to look forward to being with friends and having fun all the past semesters, but now all my "friends" have their own friends, boyfriends/girlfriends, and there's nothing back at college for me other than school work. i know it's too late to make new friends at this point, even though everyone tells you it's never too late. everyone may be nice when i approach them, but i always feel left out because they already have a steady group of best friends... and this is why i stopped trying so hard to find new friends but instead tried to stick with the people i know, even though they don't consider me the kind of friend i consider them to be.

oh well. at least i still have my laptop.
