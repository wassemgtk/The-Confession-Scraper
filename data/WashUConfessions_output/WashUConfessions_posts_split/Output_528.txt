I miss saying "I love you" to my significant other (now ex). I really appreciated the meaning behind those words. Of course I say it to my friends and family, but it meant something different when I said it to them. Sometimes I get the urge to say it again even though we've been broken up for a while...I guess I just still miss them in general.
