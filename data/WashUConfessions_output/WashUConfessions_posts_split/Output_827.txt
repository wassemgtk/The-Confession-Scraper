After returning home, a not so close family friend asked me "Are you okay, after Ferguson and all of that stuff? Are you safe? I hope that none of that drama reached campus, it's just a shame. We just want to make sure you're okay!" To which I replied, "St. Louis is more than Ferguson." Apparently the woman got truly offended by my comment and thought I was being rude and judgemental (don't quite get that one).

However, I find her response quite ironic, as that's exactly what I thought she was being when she asked such a naive question/comments. What happened in Ferguson is bigger than STL, and in many ways as those flyers around campus indicated, it reached our campus in many ways. What she said hints at a deeper ignorance and lack of awareness of what happened and still is happening in Ferguson, and around the country. I wanted to tell her off for the ignorance and insensitivity of what she asked me, but I held my tongue.

I don't know if I'm making sense, but what I'm trying to say is that the events in Ferguson effect everyone, in STL and elsewhere, and shouldn't be taken lightly  or regarded as foreign and tertiary issues to those outside of STL. STL is more than Ferguson, and Ferguson is about more than what happened last summer. It's about so much more, and this country and its people must work openly and passionately to encourage enlightened dialogue, compassion, understanding, and change.
