I confess that I'm as confused as ever. I'm a senior female who was raised in a conservative family and always thought that I should live by "traditional" values when I was young. In high school, I never had an interest in drinking or hooking up... I liked spending quiet nights with my boyfriend at the time. When he and I got into different colleges, he wanted to stay together but I listened to my friends who urged me to be "free" from responsibilities. They told me that I should just worry about myself and just focus on having fun when I got to college. So I took their advice and showed up to college as a single woman! I felt awful leaving my boyfriend behind... but I figured that it was just part of growing up.

Not wanting to be a party girl, I spent my first semester dating a couple boys... and it wasn't long until I found myself in another relationship. Maybe I just felt scared being alone... but nonetheless, I tried my best to be a good girlfriend for him. Everything seemed fine until we got back from winter break and he admitted to me that he cheated on me when he was home! Heartbroken and upset, I swore that I wouldn't let any boy hurt me like that again. I spent my spring semester drinking for the first time and going to frat parties... forcing myself to hook up with random guys but then not allowing myself to develop feelings for them. I thought I could be stone cold. Like Post #1681, I became addicted to the attention that came with hooking up... but each time I left the guy's room or he left mine, I would feel completely empty inside. Like what I was doing just wasn't right. I was trying to be this strong independent feminist woman, but all my efforts to put up emotional walls just led to all of my emotions being bottled up inside, consuming me. While I'm not suicidal, it has gotten to the point where I've thought about hurting myself.

I just want to be happy... I put on this fake mask that I'm this tough person who can handle anything. But in reality, I miss caring for someone else and having that person care about me in return. I'll never admit it to my friends... but I wish I could learn to trust a man again because I don't want to hook up anymore. I wish I was in a happy relationship... I just feel like it's not going to happen though.
