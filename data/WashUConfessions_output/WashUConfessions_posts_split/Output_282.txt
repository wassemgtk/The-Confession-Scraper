I honestly admire the EMS team so much. Can we all just take a moment and appreciate their hard work?They're able to take on a full course load, do other extracurriculars, work long shifts as an EMS, and do all of those things well. It amazes me that they're just students, and the work they do is valuable and meritable. Keep doing what you do guys. You're awesome.
