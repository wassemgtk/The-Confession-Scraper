I was recently diagnosed with herpes. I cried when my doctor told me. I've only had one partner and we've been together exclusively for multiple years. I can't tell any of my friends from fear of either stigma or excessive sharing. I can't openly complain about how painful my genitals feel or how uncomfortable both sitting and standing often are or how terrible the pills I need to take taste or how I might have to deal with all this shittiness over and over again for the rest of my life. I thought I did everything right and now I'm an STD statistic. I have herpes.
