I get all of my food from the vending machines. I have a meal plan but I never use it. I eat alone in my room because I'm afraid people will judge me if they see me eating skittles and cheetos for dinner. I know it's incredibly unhealthy, but I've never cared much about my health. I fucking love junk food.
