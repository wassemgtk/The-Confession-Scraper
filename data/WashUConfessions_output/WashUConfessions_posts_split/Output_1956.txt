I think it's ridiculous for the Chancellor to say anything about the devastation of Ferguson at all, considering he sent out a mass email to the community the night the Michael Brown incident occurred. Regardless if it's a civil rights issue or not, we can all agree that that was too early to have any facts about what happened and he has a responsibility as someone who has such a long email list at his disposal to treat his community with care and think about the repercussions of his actions. Instead of reprimanding anyone, HE should be sending out an apology for acting so quickly and irrational. He set a bad example for anyone who wanted to logically and peacefully protest.
