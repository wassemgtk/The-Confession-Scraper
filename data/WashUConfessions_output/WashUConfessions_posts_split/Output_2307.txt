Sometimes there are confessions on here that reveal an uncomfortableness with lacking dating/sexual/relationship experiences. It seems like a lot of this stems from a fear of not conforming to normalcy, of being behind in an imaginary race. I thought I'd just mention my own path because it seems like it isn't mainstream enough, you might not be aware such life choices exist. I wasn't in a relationship ever until my senior year here, I ended up sharing a bed with my bf for over a year before actually having sexual intercourse, and then we graduated and got married and now we're happy simple real world adults. Just do whatever you are comfortable with and everything works out. That is all. Don't worry about what anyone else is doing, you do you.
