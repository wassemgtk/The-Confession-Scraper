Do any other Wash U athletes absolutely abhor the trainers? Perhaps it's the sport I'm in, but we get almost no attention, they're rude to us, and they won't help with common injuries. I know there are athletes on my team who ask to much, or who are rude back. I understand that. But I am not, I am appreciative, and I would like some courtesy in return.
