Although I was never handcuffed, or arrested, I once had to meet with a judicial representative a couple times. As I sat through several meetings with my RCD, and the judicial representative, they continually reiterated the idea of how I was hurting the WashU community and my attitude would have to change if I planned on graduating from WashU. They all made it clear that if I were to repeat this violation again I would suffer more severe consequences, etc, etc. Soon after these meetings occurred, I was given several sanctions including a monetary fine (even though my actions did not involve damage to property or the involvement of police) and a "Dont Gamble With Your Future" quiz (which by the way is a complete joke considering the fact that after you complete it, you are entered into a lottery for prizes). Because I was a freshmen at the time, I was really scared and felt like my walls were caving in. A couple days after my meeting with the judicial representative I met with an individual who introduced himself as James. Despite his busy schedule, he met with me for an hour in the middle of the week. He began by talking about his background and smiled when I told him about my infraction, saying "what kid doesnt make a mistake or two when growing up". Despite this, he did follow up by asking me how I would plan on learning from the incident and how I would avoid it from happening again. After that, he helped me set goals for myself throughout the semester which he planned to follow up on. It was not until the end of the conversation that he formally introduced himself as Dean McLeod and that his office doors were open any time I needed to talk. All in all, this message goes towards the administration. I understand that the few deans on campus who are responsible for punishing students will not always have the best rep on campus. You do the job that no one really wants to do. I do believe when students commit violations they should be rightfully punished. However, I do believe that administrators could be doing a much better job in terms of working with students who might be having problems, instead of against them... Look at what the media is saying. WashU is one of the most stressful schools in the country. I think you guys need to take this more into account when dealing with the future contributors to your endowment. Every time I walk by the James E. "Jim" McLeod bench memorial on the South 40, I think to myself how grateful I am to have met him because without him I do not know if I would have made it through WashU.
