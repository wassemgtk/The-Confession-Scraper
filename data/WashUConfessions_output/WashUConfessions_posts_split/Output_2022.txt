I confess that before this summer, I've always had a really bad style and fashion sense. Since then, some friends took me out shopping and I've gotten a lot better. Since I've come to Wash U, people have started to compliment me on my clothes and appearance, and it feels so fucking amazing. It's so difficult to have problems with body positivity and self-consciousness, and I'm so grateful for all the people who took a few seconds out of their day to tell me they like my hair or shirt. It really means a lot, more than you may ever know.
