This page seems to get a lot of negative posts about the quality of this school. But honestly, I'm so incredibly happy here. WashU has allowed me to explore who I really am, make amazing friends, and get involved in a ton of causes. I see something beautiful in every day here. Almosy every person I meet here is interesting and engaging and has a cool story. I wouldn't change my decision to come here for anything.
