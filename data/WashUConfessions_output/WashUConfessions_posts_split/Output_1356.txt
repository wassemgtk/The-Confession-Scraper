I recently met a dual-degree student here at WashU. I think he went to undergrad at a place where there wasn't much social interaction, which in turn has made him extremely socially awkward. Awkward isn't always a bad thing though, there's definitely a market for it!

So, everyone, embrace your awkwardness. Normal people die. Awkward people make history.   ( ....but also, social cues are important things to pick up on, so know thy awk-limit)
