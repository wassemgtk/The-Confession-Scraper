A lot of people assume I have money because of the amount that I spend in the bar. But the truth is, I shouldn't be spending that money where I do because I don't have it.

I work a job on campus and I make money for myself (I have almost a full financial aid package), and then I spend it at the bar, to the detriment of other things. Sometimes I skip meals so I'll have more money for alcohol. Sometimes I take old food that's half eaten that I find lying around. I certainly never buy anything like clothes anymore, and I take my medicines every other day instead of every day so I don't have to pay for refills as often. I have even blown my entire savings from my summer job on the bar.  I know which drinks will get me drunk for the least amount of money.

I'm just writing this because I'd like to say that, before you judge someone for supposedly having a lot of money to spend at the bar, maybe consider instead that they might have a drinking problem and reach out to them for help. Because I know that I've heard a thousand times "oh it must be nice to have so much money to spend on alcohol" but I've never once heard "I've noticed you spend almost every night at the bar, are you doing ok?" Just something to consider.
