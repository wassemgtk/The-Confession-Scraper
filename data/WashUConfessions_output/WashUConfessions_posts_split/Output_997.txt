I've never been in a real long-term or serious relationship. It's somewhat bothered me throughout most of college, but I've just tried to push it to the back of my mind as time has gone on. I've watched a lot of my close friends get into these serious relationships and seen them slip away. I never thought I'd say this, but I'm worried for the day when I find my special person. I don't want to be completely wrapped up in them all the time and them thinking I'm needy and with myself forgetting about everyone else. I also don't want to lose any close friendships I have at the time by constantly being with my significant other. It's a weird fear, especially given that I don't have anyone now and my prospects are slim to none. It's too bad I've never really had any practice, but I really hope that I can balance my time without losing people in the process.
