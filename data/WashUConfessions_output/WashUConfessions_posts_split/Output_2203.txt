Compliments Club does nothing but make me feel objectified,annoyed,and uncomfortable. I avoid the underpass on Friday afternoons at all cost because of them. I have dealt with major insecurity issues my entire life and the way that they yell at me and "compliment" superficial things only increases my anxiety and nervousness. The way they present themselves comes off as extremely superficial and attention seeking. I understand the purpose of the club, but they need to realize that not all good intentions reap positive outcomes. I don't think they're bad people or have bad intentions, but j also don't think that their intentions are translated in the best ways. It would be more meaningful to express a compliment to someone outside of a two hour time span once a week while holding a poster advertisement.
