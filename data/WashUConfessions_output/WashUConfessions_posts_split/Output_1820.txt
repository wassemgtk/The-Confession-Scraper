I confess that my family does not have money to support me through my second year of college. But after the first semester I have made extraordinary achievements both academically and extracurricularly. I am not really worried because I have several plans to get myself supported, albeit they are all actually long-shots. Next semester will be the biggest challenge in my life up to now. I believe I have my fate in my own hands.
