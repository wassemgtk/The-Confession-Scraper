I farted loudly in mallinckrodt yesterday. It's funny that you can hear stuff echo in there after its empty at night. It puts my life in perspective: during the day you hear so many voices that it's hard to listen to yourself, but being alone sometimes can remind you to listen to yourself every once in a while.
