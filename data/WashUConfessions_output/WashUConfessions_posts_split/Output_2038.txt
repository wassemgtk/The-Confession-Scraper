I confess that I'm pretty sure I'm some form of alcoholic. Does anyone know of a good resource that isn't SHS but is also covered by WashU insurance? I went to SHS for my depression. I'm suspicious that their uselessness led to my alcoholism.

I don't expect you to care. I don't expect anything of anybody. I just hope someone understands how tough this is, even if they don't have an answer to my question.
