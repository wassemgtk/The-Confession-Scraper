I always(!) want sex more than my boyfriend.  We have an amazing relationship and we're both attractive people, I am really just a more sexual person.  It took me a really long time to get okay with our dynamic and realize that guys don't always have to play the role of sex-crazed neanderthal as dictated by society.
