I recently aged out of my parents' health care plan. After doing research, I've come to be pissed off at the new healthcare exchange system. My deductible, and it's one of the lower ones, is ten times what it was on my previous plan. I have friends aging out of Tricare whose plans have deductibles up to thirty times their previous ones. We're being swindled.
