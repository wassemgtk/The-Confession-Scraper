I confess that I think I'm developing some serious health problems. I sometimes try to tell myself that it isn't as bad as it seems and that my symptoms aren't severe enough to even be diagnosed, but there are times when I just sit and cry in frustration or fear. I would never hurt myself (out of love for my parents, really), but I think about what would happen if I did. Sometimes it feels like I should be blaming my "friends," who leave me out of basically any and all plans and don't seem concerned about me at all. My roommate basically doesn't live here anymore, either, and I'm starting to think it may be personal. And then sometimes I get angry with myself for being this way or for feeling too guilty or scared to speak up. Like this is something I want or can control. But it's not. And it's not anyone's fault, either.

I mean, I know nobody can do anything for me after reading this post. But I want everyone to really think about how their actions impact the people they care about. Please pay attention to your friends. Maybe my friends don't event realize that what they're doing is really taking a toll on my mental health. Maybe they've never noticed my symptoms. But come on: nobody gets 500 extra meal points by eating three meals a day. And I don't do much to hide my depression. I spend way too much time alone, though, because I'd feel awkward hanging around with people when I wasn't invited so they clearly don't want me there. I think being alone is what's really getting to me.

I'm not sure whether I want people to notice and help or to simply acknowledge the fact that they're not being particularly good friends. And I know I can't fix my depression or my possible eating disorder on my own. So I guess all I'm hoping by writing this post is that people will be more aware of what their friends are going through, whether they play a role in it or not.
