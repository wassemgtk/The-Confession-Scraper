A lot of people assume I'm socially very confident and have a great social life because I'm really good at making first impressions and therefore have a lot of friends and aquintances. But it's always been hard for me to translate these into good friends, and a lot of times I'm just alone because I'm too scared and anxious to ask someone to hang out, even though I know I have friends who would love to. I would exchange all the friends I have here just for a couple that I could comfortably hang out with all the time. I know I can't be the only one who feels this way.

Next semester, I'll be braver. :)
