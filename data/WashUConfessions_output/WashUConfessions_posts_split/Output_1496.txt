Everything at WashU is going really well and I feel very happy here. I have all my extracurriculars together, I'm doing okay in school and have a lot of friends. On the other hand, my family is falling apart as a result of a divorce and some of my siblings academic performance. The worst part of it all is that everyone including my own parents are looking up to me for help when I can't do anything when I am so far away. I feel like a failure but I know that I couldnt have foreseen it. It eats me up inside seeing them struggle and the only way I can support them is by doing well in school and hope that they can be strong enough until I can support them with my own income.

I say this for two reasons: 1) I just want to get this off my chest. It was something that I wanted to get out even if no one knows who I am. 2) Be kind to people. You don't know what they are going through and the secrets that they might be concealing. A smile can go a long way.
