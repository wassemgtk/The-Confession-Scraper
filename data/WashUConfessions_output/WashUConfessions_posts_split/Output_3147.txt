Many times throughout the year, I've considered seeking medical help in the form of antidepressants, but by the time I have the time in my schedule to meet up with psychiatrist I start to feel like I'm 'getting better' ...only to wish I had the help a week later. I pretend to be happy, but I'm on a roller coaster ride not to 'highs' but lows to 'normal'. I'm struggling and I don't want a therapist, I just want to know that my friends care.
