I loved my time in grad school at Wash U, but quitting my PhD program was the most life-affirming thing I've ever done. I hated the insular academic world, I hated the idea of researching some tiny fragment of a topic for years, and I realized that I could teach outside of academia without losing anything. I had an advisor who suggested I think about a divorce when I was having work-life balance issues, which soured me greatly to the idea of staying in a field where my research on some insignificant centuries-old problem. I'm so much happier doing what I do now, and I caution people who have a single-minded focus on grad school to remember that there's a real work that you leave behind in the ivory tower of academia, if you're not careful.
