I don't know why, but this year has been incredibly difficult for me so far. I can't put words to it. I've fallen so behind in one of my classes that I'm honestly considering withdrawing from it, but it's a pre-med requirement and I know that if I withdraw, seeing as I want to study abroad, there's a very slim chance of me graduating on time if I do. Even with all of that on the line, I still can't find the motivation to catch up on the work. Every morning when I wake up, I can't find the energy to get out of bed and go to the class. When I come home, I have a hard time sitting down and starting the material that I have put off for so long. I have no idea what I'm going to do for the next exam, and just thinking about it terrifies me. I'm even reluctant to talk to a tutor or a TA just because I'm so behind and I'm honestly ashamed that I've neglected the class for so long. I'm not looking for a pat on the back and someone to tell me that I can do whatever I put my mind to, because I know that I can. Actually putting my mind to it is what's been the hard part for me.

I love my major, I landed an amazing job this semester, I get along well with my parents, and I could have never even imagined meeting a guy as amazing as my boyfriend. Because of all of this, I feel like I have no reason to feel the way I feel. I'm doing well in my other classes. I know that I deserve to be here; I wouldn't have gotten in if I didn't. With that being said, I just feel exhausted and unmotivated all of the time and I can't explain why. I get enough sleep, I exercise, I eat healthy and stay hydrated. I feel like I'm stuck in a rut and I just don't know how to get out of it.

I would love to talk to someone at SHS but the appointments book so far in advance... feeling like this kind of comes and goes in waves for me, so I always feel like I'll make an appointment and then feel better by the time it rolls around. Sometimes I think this is just a phase that I'm going through, but lately I've realized that I might actually need some help.
