This is very dark, but I confess that a lot of people ask me why my hair is short (as opposed to pictures of me when it was down to my hips) and I tell them I had to cut it off after an accident. But the truth is that two years ago  I got into a fight with my boyfriend and he grabbed me, grabbed my hair and chopped it off with a scissors. It was an abusive relationship and I left him back in our home state... I barely call. He still thinks we're together but luckily I know he can't afford to come looking for me. I feel free as a bird. Glad that's over.
