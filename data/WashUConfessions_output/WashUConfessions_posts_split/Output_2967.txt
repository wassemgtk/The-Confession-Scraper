I'm actually a HUGE advocate of WashU's sustainability policies. Lately, I've made a big step towards lowering my carbon footprint by showering immediately after I poop. No toilet paper used at all! It was hard at first seeing poop run down my leg, but it's totally worth it in order save the Earth. Let's all do our part!
