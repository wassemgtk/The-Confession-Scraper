One of my friends was on Tinder last night and was matched with a guy who told her he played for the NFL. We looked him up and he was indeed a player for the St. Louis Rams. He invited her over, but she was hesitant. We decided that two other guys and I would accompany her. We sat in his living room while she made out with a Rams player. Party at his house next weekend?
