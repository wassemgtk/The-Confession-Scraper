At age two, I was diagnosed with PDD-NOS, an autism spectrum disorder. I was also one of the very few children who fully recovered, and now I show hardly any autistic traits or symptoms. I have healthy friendships and I do well academically. But I worry that my children will be genetically pre-disposed to have autism. Honestly, it would really kill me not to be able to have a normal relationship with my kids. I'm also frustrated that psychologists know so little about what causes autism, and why I was one of the lucky ones. I wish I had more answers.
