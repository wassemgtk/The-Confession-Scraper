They say one test doesn't determine your future. 

But in my case, it greatly affects it. I had been struggling with mental illness and other circumstances the last two semesters to finally land me on academic probation. As a junior applying to internships, they all require at least a 3.0 GPA, so this semester, I was determined to turn things around and get my GPA up to the 3.0 mark. I knew it would be tough, but after getting help, and figuring out things, I finally had a sense of drive and ambition to achieve a goal for the first time in a long time. After working my ASS off this semester, I thought I had done it. But from the last final I took, I was one multiple choice question away from the letter grade cutoff, which ultimately kept me below at a 2.99. All of the progress I made, all of the work I put in this semester doesn't matter as much as that one multiple choice question. I'm done.
