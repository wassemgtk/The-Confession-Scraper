I have started doubting my attractiveness to telling myself that I'm unattractive and that I should just get over it. Honestly, don't know which is worse. I just wish I was attractive. People say seeking validation from other people is lame. Well, I think it's perfectly normal. Who doesn't want to feel wanted? Nobody.
