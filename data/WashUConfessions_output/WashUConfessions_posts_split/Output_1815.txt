Current first-year here. Over the summer I analyzed each a Cappella group on campus, making lists of which ones I would love to be in. I hadn't sung in a formal setting in years, and I was never incredibly good, but I love singing and music. When I got on campus and looked into auditioning, I felt extremely intimidated by the a cappella culture on campus. Every group seems to be so cliquey and exclusive, and it just doesn't seem fun. I also felt so judged by almost all the current a cappella members. It drove me away from auditioning for something I've wanted to do for years. My mom was more disappointed than I was, and I hate to make her upset and let her down.

So even though I go to the concerts and wish I could be onstage singing, now when I see the a cappella cliques on campus being oh-so-exclusive and holier than thou, I'm kind of glad I didn't get caught up in that lifestyle.
