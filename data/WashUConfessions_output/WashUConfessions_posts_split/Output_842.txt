To those contemplating or discussing suicide on here,
I know things seem awful, and you may not see any other way out, but just because you don’t see them doesn’t mean they don’t exist.
But more importantly, don’t do it for yourself. You have no idea how much pain you will inflict on your parents, your family, and your friends. I lost my brother to suicide four months ago, and there’s no pain like losing someone so close. I had to hold my mother as they lowered my little brother into the ground. Please don’t do that to your parents or your family or friends.
They say that suicide doesn’t end the chances of life getting worse. Suicide ends the possibility of it ever getting better. It can improve. Believe me, there are so many people who will step up for you, but we need you to reach out to us, to your family, to anyone.
