now this happened a couple weeks ago and i keep meaning to submit it but i just havent had the time. so anyways its like 1am, the middle of the week, my girlfriend and i are walking back to her place but we end up stopping for a bit in that 5 car parking area behind lopata. needless to say we were enjoying ourselves. so it turns out the car we were using for some support belonged to an old man that just so happened to be walking out at that time and when he saw what we were doing proceeded to run us off yelling about how theres no human decency left in the world. now this kinda pisses me off cause i know we didnt pick the ideal place to get it on but chasing a guy without letting him put his dick back in his pants isnt a very decent thing to do either.
