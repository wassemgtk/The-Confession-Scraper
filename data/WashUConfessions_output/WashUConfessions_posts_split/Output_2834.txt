My confession is that I am a Christian. And everyone at WashU needs to hear this: we're sorry. Our greatest commandment is to love, and we suck. We do just about everything but legitimately love, and it's shameful. But I gotta say one more thing. To love is not to agree, and to differ is not to hate. For us, it's a matter of what happens for eternity to agree about certain things. Although a lot of us are purely judgmental, a great lot of us simply care too much to be silent about what we believe is best for human flourishing. For Christ, all are welcome, and welcome as they are. After all, Jesus said "He who is blameless, throw the first stone," and as most of you can attest, we certainly aren't blameless. I try to speak for all Christians when I say we all have failed you all, especially in communicating that Christianity is not about being better, but about admitting how much we fail, and accepting God's gracious forgiveness to become better. Thank you all, and God Bless.
