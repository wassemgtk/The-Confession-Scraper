Senior checking in. If WashU was good for something, it really helped me grow the hell up. I came in as a freshman expecting the world to be offered to me on a silver platter - grades, girls, partying, job prospects, everything. I expected to be coddled throughout my 4 years and come away with a badass degree after 4 fantastic years from a badass school. Year by year, nay, month by month you realize that you decide your path and work to build it. Yeah, my GPA tanked (probably more so than if I had gone to my state school), but I'm better for it going forward. I know how to work, when to work, and when to turn that switch off and do other things. You know what? So do the vast majority of your peers, and I'm glad that I got exposed to the level of competition (friendly or not) here because the real world doesn't provide office hours or TA help sessions. It's all on you. Welcome to the rest of your life. So, thanks WashU for helping me at least mature. Even though this page may be littered with pretty stupid things from presumably immature people, they'll all learn in due time, if not at WashU then wherever they end up next. tl;dr WashU: Where the only thing that goes down on you is your GPA. Lol ya lazy.
