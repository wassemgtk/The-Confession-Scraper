I find it funny how people can only point out the negatives they encounter with talks about race. There was literally three days dedicated to Race & Ethinicity dialogue. Some of our top professors and student leaders attended and spoke about race & ethnicity not only in America but at Washington Universit as well. I sat next to chancellor wrighton and spoke to him about my own experiences as a black low income student at Wash U and heard his insights as well. As a delegate it is my responsibility to not only inform you that you can easily go to voices.wustl to access the three day experience but you can also take part in the experience by blogging or tweeting. If you REALLY want to know how people feel or understand that racism is still Rampant in America (maybe not blatant but it is still here) then go watch what your peers had to say. No one wants you to "feel bad" as a white student rather we want you to be aware of your privileges and our oppression. No one is trying to demonize you either. You'll see that once you watch the videos.. And please Don't tell me you don't have time to watch the videos but you have time to be on fb, snapchat, yik yak, Instagram etc. etc. if you really want to gain a better understanding (you don't even have to agree) then go access the footage and maybe you'll be more enlightened. :)  toddles .
