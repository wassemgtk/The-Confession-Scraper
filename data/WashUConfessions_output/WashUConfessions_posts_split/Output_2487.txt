I confess that I'm a little annoyed with the Black activists on campus. You cause an uproar when anything small happens in the community that might be misconstrued as racism. I'm annoyed because you are more privileged than most of the country. You are not from the ghetto. You are very sheltered and probably have never experienced severe racism firsthand. I'd be more likely to listen to you if you had actually risen from the bottom to attend WashU but I doubt that is the case for any Black people here.
