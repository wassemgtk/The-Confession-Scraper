I confess that I think I may be polyamorous. I've only been in 1 or 2 relationships (both monogamous) and although I now feel more in love than ever, I can't stop myself from wanting to keep exploring. I am sick of people judging me for not aligning "how I feel about my girlfriend" and "the fact that I still am interested in others" how society prescribes and how they would do so. I wish people could be more open minded about sexuality and heteronormativity. Are there any other polys out there?
