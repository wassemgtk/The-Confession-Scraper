I really wish all of the energy that goes into hatred and criticisms on this campus went to love and support of one another. The fact that we are all intelligent enough to have differing opinions is so amazing, but why not use it to enact positive change? I confess that it hurts when people belittle what I am passionate about. I try my absolute best to be accepting of everyone's opinions, to listen to my friends go on and on about the things they are passionate about even though I don't really care about the subject or agree with them, and I honestly wish they would do the same for me. For anyone reading this post, even though sometimes you may think you're being funny by making light of what someone cares about, even though you think the person doesn't care because they always just smile and play along, they may actually care. And it may actually really weigh down on them that the people they love make less of what they trully care about. For a person that wants to dedicate their life to something, and that tries to do their best to be the best person possible, it really hurts when their friends make light of it. So I guess the reason I posted this is just to urge everyone to think before your speak, and just be respectful at all times. Many of us are taught the golden rule of "treat others the way you would like to be treated" during infancy, but I guess it's just one of those things you forget over time.
