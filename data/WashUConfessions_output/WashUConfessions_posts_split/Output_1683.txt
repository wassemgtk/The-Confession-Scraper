I am half Jewish.  The wrong half.  I know that isn't politically correct but its true.  My mother's side is Italian Catholic and my dad's side is Jewish.

When people ask my ethnicity I say Jewish and Italian.  Which usually leads to my explaining that religiously, I am Catholic.

I have been on many a date that were going well right up until I explain this to my date (who is Jewish)  at which point she goes from excited and having fun to clock watching and giving 1 word answers.  Like I can almost hear her mind going "not Jewish, thanks for playing"

And that's fine!  Everyone has their deal breakers.

But it happened again recently (the whole date routine) and for the first time I am seriously considering attempting to disconnect from Jewish culture.  Just tell people I am Italian and Catholic, taking my mother's maiden name or take my future wife's.  Forsaking the Jewish last name I have carried my whole life feels weirder than anything else.  Like I am stabbing my family in the back.  But again why should I carry on a Jewish name when I am not Jewish?

I am really in the dark here and I have seen the Jewish community on here before offer some good insight to people with problems or questions.

I just want to hear some thoughts on this.
