I don't want to open up about my mental illness to my friends because I care a lot about them, and I don't want to become toxic to them. To me, telling them about it is forcing them to consider it and care all the time, and I don't want them to make that effort when I don't think they're even able to help me.
A while ago, one of them (drunk) was expressing frustration over not knowing how to deal with a close friend that had depression. I probably shouldn't have taken that to heart as much as I did, but... it was a strong confirmation of my fears. I don't ever want to be seen that way.
