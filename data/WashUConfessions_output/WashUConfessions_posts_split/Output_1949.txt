Lol the fact that so many people are "upset" that the chancellor "took sides" on the Ferguson issue. Since when is standing up for equality a matter to take sides over. There's only one side. And that's justice. He said he didn't like the racism on campus or in our local community. Why are you all so damn upset about it? And to everyone who feels like they have no space to talk about anything. Get up, get off of the Internet and talk to someone. I posted on here and I will also have this convo with a real life person.
