I confess that (like many others) I think the admin fills an incredibly difficult role that others may not appreciate. (Confession #2750, looking at you, bud.)

As an addendum: I'm sorry to hear the current admin is stepping down, for whatever reason. Is there any way to volunteer to be the next admin?

Hey, I appreciate that. I'll put out an application of some sort after my resignation.
