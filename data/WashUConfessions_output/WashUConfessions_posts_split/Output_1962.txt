What the fuck happened to our school? People are seriously depressed and have really alarming amounts of anxiety. How does Chancellor Wrighton sit back and pat himself on the back for addressing Ferguson while not mentioning a goddam thing about what kids feel like at WashU. I'm not saying he doesn't care, but seriously stand up and say something. I'm just flat-out disappointed. Come on man.

We have three psychiatrists on campus, who are very booked up on appointments, and we don't even have the option of seeing a male doctor for psychiatric treatment if we want to. Aside from depression and anxiety, we have absolutely ZERO discussion about ADHD/LDs, no talk about social anxiety, and no discussion about how tons of people are posting on WashU Confessions about these topics because they don't have anyone to talk to.

This is our community. Kids here clearly need help and as an older student it really upsets me to see that the younger students aren't getting the help they need.
