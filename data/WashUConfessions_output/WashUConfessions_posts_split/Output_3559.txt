To whoever it was in Lien that took the US flag out of the washer and thought it was perfectly fine to throw it on the floor (I mean, you couldn't set it on the table? Really? The flag??) Well I just wanted you to know that it's stained with somebody's bodily fluid. Now... why THAT happened is an entirely different story that I'm equally as upset about.
