I just got into med school, but I'm considering not attending. The golden age of doctors is coming to an end. Artificial intelligence is on the rise, and before we know it, computers will replace doctors. Think about it. Pre med and med school programs focus on heavy memorization in order to turn students into human databases that can effectively diagnose diseases. Google has billions of times more information than any human could memorize, and it is accessible to most people at the swipe of a screen. There will even be robots that can do almost any surgery. Has anyone ever gotten Lasik surgery? The machine does everything and the doctor doesn't do much at all. Long story short, I think I'm gonna become an engineer so that my skills do not become obsolete.
