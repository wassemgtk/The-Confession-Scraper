So I was thinking about it and I was trying to come up with an example of what finals week is like for Wash U students, partly because I wanted to shed more light for the prefrosh and partly because I need to explain it to my little brother. Here's the deal about Wash U work hard play hard is a pretty apt description of the schools environment. The work is strenuous and its hard to catch up so stay ahead but there's always something going on and the people really are incredible. I think finals week is best described as the movie Crank. If you havent seen it give it a go, super short, not great but fun. Imagine yourself as Chev Chelios and one day you wake up with a startling realization, in the movie he was poisoned and at Wash u it's more of a "Woah, finals are in 4 days". The only reason its "Woah" is that there is a mini break "reading week", a time period no one really uses for anything but not studying. Then you hear that if you stop moving you die, or in this case if you stop studying you are fucked. Then you grab whatever suppliments you can to keep you going, red bulls, coffee, nos, fried foods, every damn pset you never wanted to see again, and you dont really sleep. Maybe you planned well and you get some kind of  sleep but caffeine doesnt really let you get rest. You dont stop until they are all done and if you do you are screwed. Dont let yourself get stuck on one problem dont let yourself play one game of league, just go. You have time afterwards. They made a sequel after all.
