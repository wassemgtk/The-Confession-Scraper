I confess that I am scared to share my political and social opinions on campus.

The overwhelming attitude on ANY given issue is: "If you're not with me, then you're against me."

It kind of shuts down the dialogue.

I want to talk to my peers about these issues. I want to engage and hear from different perspectives. That's why I came to college, but people of differing viewpoints are so often criminalized by their opponents.

I have seen so many people shot down by their classmates for daring to proffer an unpopular opinion. So I keep my mouth shut.
