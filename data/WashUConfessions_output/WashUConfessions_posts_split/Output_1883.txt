I'm curious to know the gender of the admin? And what he or she is like outside of Confessions. It's kinda like how you know your professors only in class and not outside of school and that astonishment and rippling warmth that floods one when one sees them just living life.

========================================

I was a dude the last time I checked (which was literally a few seconds ago, just to make sure I wasn't lying to you). 

It's hard for me to really give an accurate description of who I am because I go through a lot of changes - not in a bad way or anything, I just make a lot of changes to my life when I see something isn't working right. 

I guess one thing that has remained constant throughout the years is that I always have a goal to work towards, and I'll work my ass off to try to get it. That's why confessions were posted at 4 AM so many times this semester. I'm aware of what isn't good in my life, things I could change, how I could improve, and what my priorities should be. I'm trying to graduate early from Wash U for financial reasons and also to get closure on some personal problems in my life, but that's still a little down the line. I'll likely be looking for a new admin when that happens. 

Either way, it doesn't matter too much who I am! I think it's important that there's no identity behind the administrator, not right now anyway. I think people would feel weird knowing who reads their confessions. I also remain anonymous for my own personal safety, but a few people have guessed who I am by the way I talk and by my personality (I've denied it each time). 

Hope you have a nice Winter Break!

(By the way, I checked again and I'm still a dude. I'll update this response if that changes overnight or something)
