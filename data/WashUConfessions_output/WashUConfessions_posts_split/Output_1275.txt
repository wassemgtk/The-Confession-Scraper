I think I should stop drinking. I know I'll have fun at parties either way, but something is ingrained me to think I have to be hammered to have fun. After parties, when I often go home alone (not that that's a bad thing), I end up becoming really sad, almost depressed. I know that it's the alcohol because I wake up and move on with my life. So, I respect everyone who doesn't need to have a drink to enjoy other people.
