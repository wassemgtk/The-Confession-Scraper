Earlier this semester, I tried to kill myself. Very few people in my life know about it, and the majority of people I know would never even suspect I was struggling with anything. I'm still struggling, and some days are harder than others, but still I put on a smile and no one suspects a thing. I can go about my day fairly normally, but the mental pain I'm in almost 24/7 is excruciating. I say this all not to look for sympathy or support, but to let everyone know that people can do a very good job of seeming put-together and mentally healthy, when their reality could be a hell that you can't even imagine. And if you suspect someone is struggling, genuinely ask them how they are. Not any of that bullshit you say when you're walking past someone. Show them you care. Even if they lie and it seems like a waste of the two seconds it took to ask them, trust me when I say that it can mean the world to someone just to know that you care about them.
