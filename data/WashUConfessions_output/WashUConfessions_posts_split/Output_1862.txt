I'm gay. I think. At  least mostly. I don't know. This has been on my mind for months. But I can't bring myself to talk to anyone about it in real life. I get caught up in the fact that I am still in a straight relationship, which I don't necessarily want to end, which I think gets really hard for other people, even myself, to understand if I am in fact gay, which I really think I am. I have almost emailed several friends, but I don't even know what to say, I'm not the type to talk about relationshipy things anyways, and this is too difficult for me to articulate. For now the best I can muster is this little confession.
