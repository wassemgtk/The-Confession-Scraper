Every time I see a friend's post, confession, new "soapbox", or yak about them realizing they are and/or coming out as demisexual, I mentally become Mr. Burns and think "Yes....join us..."

(I'm actually really happy that anyone feels brave enough to come out as anything seriously even if they don't actually come out)
