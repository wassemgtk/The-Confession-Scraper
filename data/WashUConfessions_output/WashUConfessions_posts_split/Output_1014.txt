There's a middle aged man who lives in my building and has been wheelchair-bound for a decade as a result of some form of motor neuron disease. He has daily nursing care but lives by himself and is undoubtedly lonely. Now that the weather is pleasant, he spends a lot of time outside the building and he seems to be there every day at  5:30 as people are returning from work. I am sure he does this because he wants the social contact, and I am sure he appreciates getting to talk to people because he always finds a way to start a conversation.

But every day when I round the corner and see him sitting there, I feel a twinge of frustration. I have run out of small talk to make and I get anxiety about finding a polite way to end the conversation and get inside. And I hate myself for it, because I know the conversations we have make his day a little brighter.

Hopefully writing this out will remind me that I should be a better person.
