I unfortunately have developed the terrible habit of stealing my dorm's and other dorm's food. Whenever I walk by a kitchen, I almost always have to stop in and open up every pantry and fridge to check for food. This habit has not only made me possibly develop a binge eating disorder, it has also changed me into a terrible person. I'm very sorry if I stole your food, but I feel so out of control now.
