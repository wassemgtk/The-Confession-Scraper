My suite-mates and I went out to the Loop for dinner on Saturday and on our way to the restaurant, we came across a homeless man in a wheelchair asking for some bus fare. As we passed by, we didn't pay much attention to him at all, but I noticed. I made sure to order another of the same meal I had that night to-go so I could give it to him on our way back. So I did.

When I gave the man the meal I'd bought for him, he was very thankful and gracious. He again asked me for some bus fare, but I told him the meal was all I had for him that night. He gave me a fist pound and thanked me as I left. As I turned by back to the man, I see a police car drive up next to the curb where the man was. The police officer quickly put the car in park, and hopped out of his patrol car with his flashlight. I was a bit ahead, so curiously I stopped for a second to see what was up. The cop turned his focus straight to the man in the wheelchair as he was beginning to open the brown bag of food I had just given him. The man started pointing at me from down the sidewalk and holding both his hands in the air. The cop looked over at me and the walked away from the man in my direction. I asked the cop if everything was alright, and with a disheveled and almost pissed off look said "yeah, yeah", so I just turned and kept walking with my suite-mates again.

It was only after my suite-mates had told me that I realized the cop might have thought it was a "drug deal" of some sorts. I felt foolish for a second, then angry. Not angry because I'd done something wrong, but angry because this man had to go through that.

Up until this point, I hadn't mentioned that this man was black. I bet you might have guessed. But assuming based on a person's situation or race should not be something that we hold our actions to. Just because of this man's disposition, he was a target of the officer's inquiry. I for one was not, even though the officer saw me hand the man the brown bag.

Is it fair to say that this encounter opened my eyes to what it must feel like? Yes. Is it okay to make this about race?  I don't know. But what I do know is that no person, of any race, religion, color, belief, or what-have-you should be treated with such suspicion as this man was.
