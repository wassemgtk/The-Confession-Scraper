Alum here: I was an RA in the days when all the dorms had physical keys in addition to the cards (do they still do that?). There was one key that opened all the buildings.

When I turned in my keys, I kept the master key, which became really helpful the next year when I dated someone on the 40 and didn't want to have to call him/her down when I wanted to visit.
