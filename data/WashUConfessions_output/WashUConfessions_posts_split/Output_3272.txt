Today, I made my first appointment for a mental health counseling visit at SHS. I'm ashamed, frustrated, and still have to make it through this week because they were booked up. The most terrifying part, though, is having to put up with life until I get to talk to a professional next week. No one knows and I don't think would ever suspect I go through mental hell every day.
