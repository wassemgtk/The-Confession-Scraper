Tonight in BD, dinner time, two girls were talking while standing in line to pay for their food when one of them dropped her apple. They both cracked up, then the other girl took the apple and put it back in the big pile and got her friend a new one. In the process of doing that, she dropped two other apples from the pile on the floor - they cracked up again and the first girl ran away over the soda machine and kept peeping through the glass while her friend turned her back and pretended nothing happened, didn't even pick the apples up. We had eye-contact for a second before I looked away, so I just want to tell you that I saw you, and I judged both you and your friend. Someone out there would kill to have those 3 apples that you carelessly left on the floor.
