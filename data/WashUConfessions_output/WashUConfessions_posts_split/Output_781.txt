I had been hooked on alcohol/heroin a couple of years ago, during high school, and I'm falling for this guy... he just confided in me that he was also using heroin at one point. I am so scared to keep seeing him, but I feel so drawn to him and I really care about him. Even though we've both been free from using for a while, I know that sharing it with someone is the way people fall down again. It's a huge 'what if' that I can't get out of my head
