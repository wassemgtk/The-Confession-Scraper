All these people looking to buy meal points make me laugh. Seriously? You can't budget your points? I see some of you posting saying you need like 500 points, stat. Seriously, how did you go through your points so quickly? Do you eat ten meals a day? Does your diet consist entirely of brunch? Or do you just pile up plate after plate of Bear meals?
