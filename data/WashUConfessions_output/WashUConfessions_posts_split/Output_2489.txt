I confess that this week, the week before my 20th birthday, I got a C on one of my tests, know that I screwed up the other one, got the lowest grade of the semester for weekly homework for another class, stayed up every single night just to finish work, and have a professor commenting my performance as "you have all sorts of problems with presentation, but well you are a ESL of course" (I literally cannot stand it when people attribute things to ESL and talk in a condescending tone. If I have problem with presentation like clarity and stuff I would be more than happy to have people pointed it out to me but please that's MY problem do not attribute that to ESL. I started learning English before kindergarten and according to many researches that almost can be counted in the native speaker range. It's just that I did not grow up here that's it.). I literally cried for half an hour after that class. And now I have an exam ON MY BIRTHDAY (a Saturday), a lot of work to do, no plans, no friends to celebrate, whatsoever, and now I am very reluctant to even be in that class again but apparently add/drop period has passed. Of course it's the best birthday presents. FML.
