Last night when the confessions were down, I was desperate to confess to somebody about my current situation. I have only slept less than 5 hours in the past two days: I don't even know why, I just keep procrastinating until it is 7 in the morning. I can't help but feeling afraid to even go out of my apartment. I can't start to do my work. I've skipped two days of classes.
I don't know whether I could get better tonight. We will see.
