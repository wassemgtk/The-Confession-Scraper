I didn't get into Uncle Joe's, and it is really eating me up inside. For once, I thought I had a chance to get into something I am really passionate/ care about, but in the end it ended up just making me feel worse about myself. I actually felt like I had a chance to get in (which is really rare for me because I have really low self-esteem), but now I feel really incompetent.

Don't get me wrong, I am so happy for the people who got into Joe's, but at the same time, I wish I was one of them. I feel like a child with a tantrum, but it was something that hit me hard, so I don't know what to do about it. I just want to know if I did anything wrong, or what it is about me that they did not like. I can't talk to anyone about this either, which is why I am posting here so at least I can rant a little about it. Sorry. I'm just beating myself about this a lot, and it's not helping at all....
