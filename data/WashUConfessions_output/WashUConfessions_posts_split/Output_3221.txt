I was admitted ED to WashU this year, and cried from excitement. I loved every single aspect of this school and I felt so happy and blessed so be accepted to a first rate, beautiful, and rigorous school next year. Due to WashU Confessions, though, I don't feel as excited anymore. All anyone does, it seems, is complain, argue, and talk about how miserable the social life is and how difficult premed is. I can't help but feel I will soon relate to the depressed kid who doesn't fit in with the Greek-dominated social scene, and to the kid who is struggling to maintain straight Cs. Nothing any current student has said has given me any hope about having a bright and happy future next year. Call me weak, dumb, closed minded, or scared, but if I weren't bound to this school I would probably pick somewhere else. Think about what you say on this page because it certainly reflects on the school as a whole, in an incredibly negative way.
