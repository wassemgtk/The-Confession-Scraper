I confess that it gets easier to say goodbye to my life at home when I leave for college. I've just established a life here at WashU and am happy with it. When I miss home, I tend to just miss my family and pets but I don't think about my home friends as much. In fact, I feel a lot closer to my friends here than to some of my high school friends. Does anyone else feel the same way?
