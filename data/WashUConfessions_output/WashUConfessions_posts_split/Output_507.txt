When my parents came up for parents' weekend, my dad asked me a lot of questions about what I wanted out of life, whether I had accomplished anything substantial since coming here, etc, and tbh it really fucked up my headspace. I'm just a freshman and I know I have some time to make these decisions, but I feel so inadequate and useless. I've already been here 6 weeks and I haven't really achieved anything, and I'm terrified that I'm never going to. More than anything, I'm scared I'm going to slip back into depression, after I spent 4 years fighting to free myself from that constant apathy and self-loathing.
