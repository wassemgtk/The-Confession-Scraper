Ok Washu, time for me to let loose.

TLDR: the only thing this kid cares about is soon to disappear.

I have a great life. Or I used to. My family is falling apart.

My dad is pretty much a genius, but at the cost of social (and inevitably relational) skills. It's finally taken a toll on my mother after 20ish years. He tries his best, but they're are too many mental distractions/blockages that keep my father from the great husband/father he can be.

My mom keeps talking about splitting up. At first (a year ago), I thought it was her just worrying. It tore my heart in half to hear that. But my father has threatened to leave my mother and younger brother multiple times in the last month (and he is the main source of income). And when he is scared, my father digs himself (and our family) into debt to try to keep him and my mother together.

Both my parents had been married before, and the last time my father said that when his first life left him, he seriously considered suicide.

So basically, if my parents split, we have no money (we have very little as it is), my home life is broken, and the thing that scares me the most is that I fear my father might end his life.

The absolute worst part is that I know their relationship is not healthy and I can do nothing.

thanks for listening admin, idgaf if you post this. it just helps to write it down. I need to face reality. Life can be shitty sometimes.
