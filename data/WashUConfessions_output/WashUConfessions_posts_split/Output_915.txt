Today as I was biking home from work, there was a man asking for cash on the corner of Forsyth and Skinker. He was walking alongside the curb, holding a cardboard sign, and peering into car windows. I don't carry cash with me, so I didn't think too much about it, but I also didn't swerve or anything to avoid him. I just stayed on my path, since I was on the sidewalk and in no danger of hitting him. However, as I biked around the corner, he suddenly yelled at me "Don't worry! You're safe on your bike!" and it startled me so much I lost control for a moment.

I'm still trying to figure out how to feel about this. Was this a joke? Was he making a bitter comment about his position versus mine? Was I supposed to laugh nervously at what he said? How was I supposed to react to a remark like that?

I simply pedaled away.
