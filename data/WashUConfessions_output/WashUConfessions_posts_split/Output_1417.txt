I am now a year clean from self-harm.

I was in a place I thought was impossible to get out of, fighting a losing battle. This was the weakest, lowest point of my life. I thought it was okay for a while because everywhere I looked, I saw depression and self-harm romanticized and seen as “tragically beautiful.” They are not. They are ugly, ugly diseases and wreak havoc on all the lives they touch.

This has been by far the hardest year of my life, it has been a battle every day. But now I’m winning this battle.

I’m living proof that it does actually get better, that it can actually be done, and I am so proud of myself. To anyone in the same place I was…please, please keep fighting.
