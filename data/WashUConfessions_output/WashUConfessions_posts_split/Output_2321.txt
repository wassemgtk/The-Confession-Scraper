I have been extremely insecure about my appearance my whole life. It is only in the last year or two that I have actually become an extremely confident person. I never saw a downside to that until I realized that the more secure I was that I am an attractive person, the more unsafe I felt as a woman. I could never relate to women who talked about not being able to walk home feeling safe or women who were tired of being harassed because I was too insecure and thought that kind of thing only happened to attractive women. I really wish that my newfound confidence didn't have to come with these new realizations about the world around me.
