Whenever I see guys complaining about how they don't want to be with a girl who has a "high count" of past sexual partners, it makes me want to scream with frustration. STDs are one thing, but just because a person has had numerous sexual experiences with a variety of people in their lifetime, that doesn't mean they're incapable of having a monogamous, long-term relationship or any other kind of relationship. It just horrifies me that a guy might like *everything else* about me but then judge me based on my "number" because that's apparently *so* important. The number of mates I've been "breed" with is not going to reduce my "quality" because I am not some commercial good, some kind of cattle, yet when these kinds of measurements of sexuality are discussed, it results in our value as people being reduced to our perceived value as sex objects.
