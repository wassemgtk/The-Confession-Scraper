One of my best friends has had mental health issues for the last few years. I hadn't heard from him in a while and was getting a little worried. Another friend told me he was back in the psych ward, which was tragic to me but at least he was safe. Out of the blue, I heard from him earlier today. Apparently he is now homeless. Both of his parents have cut him off and he doesn't know what he is going to do. He dropped out of school about a year ago for financial reasons, but he had been planning on transferring to somewhere in state. Now he's just lost. He told me he has no idea what he is going to do, and I honestly don't know what to say. The guy is one of my best friends and I have no idea how to help him.

I don't know if I'm asking for advice or venting or what, but I just needed to put this somewhere.
