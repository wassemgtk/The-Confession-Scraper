Honestly, I'm sick and tired of hearing from all of these self-righteous types at WashU. Yes, I get that some things people do or say may upset you, but it really isn't necessary to bring up one little thing someone did or said and blow it way out of proportion. As the saying goes, "sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me." There are definitely those events that should require intervention, but only in those cases when it deeply affects the WashU community. Confronting someone based on something that they may have done or something that slipped out of their mouth because it offends you is perfectly fine, if you would like to educate them on what YOU believe they did wrong. People will say and do offensive things and it's just something that we as human beings have to learn how to deal with. I think as college students we have our big boy undies and big girl panties on so we can ignore/brush these things off. If someone says or does something that offends you, then be my guest and confront them about it. Just please don't go complaining to the world about your problems in hopes that someone will do the job for you. If the person won't change and you do make it widely known what they did, it will only anger and frustrate other students and self-righteous types. What are they going to do that you couldn't? If you fail to change the way these people think and act, then why not just leave them out of your lives? I'm sure those people who are your friends will know not to offend you, and those who do offend you without hearing you out don't deserve to be your friends. (As clich√© as that is.) In conclusion, please keep petty complaints about other WashU students to yourself unless it affects the community in a significant way. Be self-righteous somewhere else. (Oh, and, as a side note, please stop using the word "privileged" to describe anyone who gets on your bad side or doesn't share your views. It has an actual meaning, believe it or not.)
