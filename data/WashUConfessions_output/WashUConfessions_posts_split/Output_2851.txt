I think it's completely disrespectful, rude, and inconsiderate of the cross country team to continue their disgusting tradition that involves throwing up all over campus. Not only does this inconvenience and gross out fellow students, but it is unfair and HORRIBLE to the staff that has to clean this up. Did you ever think about the impact that your actions have had on others? Additionally, how do you think this reflects on our university? Tours and other people not associated with WashU walk through the 40 every day, and to see a trail of vomit is disgusting. If continuing to do this "tradition" every year is so important to you all, take it some place else. We don't want the consequences all over our campus.
