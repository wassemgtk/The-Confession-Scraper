My confessions never get posted and it makes me really sad because I honestly want to know if other people have the same feelings about this school as I do. I feel like Wash U is a terrible place for mental health. I've never had problems with mental health before coming to this school but I feel like the ridiculous levels of stress at this school have brought out the worst in me. And the worst part is I don't think the administration really understands the problem. I cannot think of a single semester at this school that I didn't spend at least half of in absolute misery. The classes here are taught so poorly its hardly worth it to attend. A majority of the professors are by far the least considerate human beings I have ever encountered. (There have been less than a handful of professors who I've legitimately likes and I'm so incredibly thankful for them.) I'm so sick and tired of being graded by impossible standards in my classes. It's absolutely absurd to give exams that your entire class will fail. What does that teach us??? Perhaps this is an Engineering School problem or perhaps this is just me but I honestly hate that I pay $60k every year to attend a school that I hate. I wish I could transfer but I'm far enough into my degree that it would be more of a detriment than a help. Do other people feel this way? Is this a widespread issue?
