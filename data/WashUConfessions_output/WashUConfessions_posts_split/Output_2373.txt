My parents nag me all the time about my grades, which I thought/hoped would go away in college, but no. It got to the point where I point-blank lied to them last year. They kept asking me for proof of my A's and even threatened to call the school! So I finally gave in and told a half-truth - that I had gotten one C (more like three). First of all, I am already disappointed in myself enough, I don't need their disappointment too. And secondly, it (they) were my first C ('s) ever! Wash U is hard, and they don't understand that. They just see me as imperfect, no matter how hard I try.
