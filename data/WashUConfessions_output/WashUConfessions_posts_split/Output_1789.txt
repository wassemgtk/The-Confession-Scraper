I got on birth control because my boyfriend and I started having sex a lot and we didn't want to use condoms anymore. The birth control completely kills my sex drive and makes me super moody. I never want to do anything further than making out and during my periods I am a cranky bitch who doesn't want to be physical in any way; holding hands or even cuddling. I feel super guilty that I am withholding the physical aspect of a relationship with my boyfriend but I actually enjoy not being obnoxiously horny all the time.
