I'm a senior.

For the past 3 years, I didn't do much (outside academics and basic social things) and thought that wustl sucked for being such a boring place.

This year, I decided to do more with my life and try tons of other stuff. I realized that Wash U actually has a lot going on...and I became a part of a much more involved community. I'm happier now more than ever, and I only regret not doing more in the last 3 years.

Go have fun! Wash U does a lot with our tuition money.
