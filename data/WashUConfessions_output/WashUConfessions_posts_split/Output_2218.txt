I know many already mentioned this, but I feel like the engineering school could teach us a lot better than what it's doing now. Mechanical engineering especially. I'm not making excuses - I get pretty good grades and I work hard, but the truth is the school just fails to teach effectively except for maybe a couple of professors per major. Frankly it feels like the school is throwing me a shovel and a pick to build a castle. Erecting new buildings doesn't help us. Please invest in a better curriculum.
