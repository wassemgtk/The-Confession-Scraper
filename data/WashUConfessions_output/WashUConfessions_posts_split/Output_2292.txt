I think I might be addicted to weed.  I've started smoking daily and even though like I need it daily and I have addiction symptoms but it's just so much a relaxer to me that it helps me start each day that much more happy.  I'm not sure this is a bad thing and I feel like without it It would be harder to stay sane at Wash U.  Also I feel like my personality has changed for the better because of it.
