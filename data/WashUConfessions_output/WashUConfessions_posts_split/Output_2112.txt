If I could rewind my life a few years, I'd definitely go to my state school instead of Wash U, not only because it's closer, costs less, and all that, but also because it's a Division 1 school. College sports is really almost a quintessential experience because it brings students together and gives them something to be proud of. Since no one pays attention to D3 sports, there's little to be proud of at Wash U. And I also confess that I think Wash U's prestige factor is nothing but hot air. Going to a prestigious school means everyone will recognize your school for it; if you have to explain what city your school is, then it means people don't recognize it and it's not a good school; it's as simple as that. I've regretted coming here so much that I actually have been telling new people I meet outside of Wash U that I attend my state school.
