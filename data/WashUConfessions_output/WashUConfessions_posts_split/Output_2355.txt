I came into college with the idea of living in the moment, no regrets, and a lot of times that meant that my portion of men would come from hookups. For the time it served its purpose, but although I never thought I would say this, I'm a junior and I'm ready for a boyfriend. Not only am I ready, I really want one. I am a very pro-believing there are tons of awesome guys out there person, and all guys are certainly not the same. There are great guys out there that want the same I do too. I won't go on Tinder or any of those things, but I wish we would somehow meet and make our lives better in that way.
