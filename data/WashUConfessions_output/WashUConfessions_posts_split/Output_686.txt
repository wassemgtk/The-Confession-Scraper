I think it is pathetic how not diverse and how closely tied to Greek life Armour is. As a fashion space, it should demand diversity, especially from a school that has so much to offer. Instead, it has become a place for friends to take photos of one another and call themselves a Student Union group. The fact that my activities fee for the school year goes to funding friends parading around in expensive clothes that they can afford makes me sad and disappointed in our university. Fashion is not about the most expensive sunglasses you can buy; its about how you put together the things in your closet in a way that expresses yourself. Please Armour, take this into consideration the next time you choose your models, your writers, your articles,etc. to keep your publication relevant and worth the money I have put into funding you.
