I'm very patriotic; I love the USA and I honestly feel a little bit happier when I see an American flag. The thing is that I'm a minority and very conscious of the fact that I most likely would not have been very welcome in the US just a few decades ago....It's almost like there are two versions of me fighting each other--one wants me to embrace my patriotism and be proud of my country, while the other is a hippie pinko commie who keeps saying, in kind of a dickish way "heh, I bet you wouldn't love America so much in 1950." Well thanks. To be honest, whenever I see a minority waving an American flag or otherwise acting patriotic, it makes me feel so happy....it makes me feel like America is my country too, and I have the right to call myself a proud and loyal American. I don't know. Can anyone relate?
