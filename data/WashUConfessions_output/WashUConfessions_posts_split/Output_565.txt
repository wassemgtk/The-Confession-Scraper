I’ve come to realize that the reason I’m so scared of opening up to people about my struggles with mental health is that I’ve acted in the worst way possible when someone else has come to me. My best friend was suicidal and severely depressed and her struggle was affecting me too much, so we ended our relationship and I haven’t talked to her in a long time. I feel like a shitty person, but at the same time, I just could not manage being friends with her anymore when she was constantly in that condition. How am I to expect others not to do the same for me?
