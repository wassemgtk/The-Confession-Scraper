I understand that this is not really an 'Ask Wash U' page, but I would like to post this to get more ideas from the Wash U Community.

I just came out of the closet to my mother and she is not pleased with me at all. She thinks I am deliberately trying to make her unhappy and that I could have chosen to be straight. I am now given some time to "change", but I know that's never going to happen. However, my mother doesn't and I'd like to know of different ways to approach this conversation. It's not that I don't know what to say, but I'd like your help on how to talk to my mom so that she can reach a state of understanding. Ultimately, I do know I am not asking for permission; I am asking for acceptance.

Please help me out! Thank you!!
