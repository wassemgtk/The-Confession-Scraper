I was molested for years as a kid. It has obviously given me a few obstacles growing up but I don't know that it's ever been harder than college. The guys I dated in high school I had known for years and trusted them completely. And that was still terrifying. But college hook up culture has left me completely scared and reckless with constant anxiety attacks. Most of my family and friends don't know I was assaulted, so it's hard to ask for help with the little things when there's such a big thing left unsaid. I'm not comfortable going home with guys I don't know but trusting a guy I barely know to go on a date or be in a relationship with is even scarier. Sometimes I feel like I'll never recover. I've been so successful in so many facets of my life, and this one thing has defined me lately and made me completely uncomfortable in my own skin with the pressures from myself and the people around me to date around and hook up.
