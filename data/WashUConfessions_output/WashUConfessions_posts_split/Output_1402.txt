It's completely hypocritical to say that people shouldn't be able to express their political opinions on WU Confessions. If you're conservative or even slightly less liberal than the top commentators you will be singled out for expressing your opinions and there are real repercussions if you "offend" someone. Keep in mind that our school has a few oversensitive pricks who think they're super intelligent and entitled to their feelings being catered to.

It's a joke to say that it's fair and that "a conservative who expresses their opinion shouldn't expect nobody to contest it." Everyone knows that when a conservative speaks up about their beliefs it goes beyond normal depute. People can report them to our school's "bias reporting system" and even if they don't in today's day and time big time individuals get in trouble for their opinions, for example: the Mozillla CEO who voted Yes on 8, artist Pharrell Williams got media hatred for expressing his views on Ferguson and now even two gay fashion designers can't say they don't believe in artificial insemination. If the students on this campus don't provide a "safe zone" for conservatives to speak (because that's equality right? If one group has one then others should too!) then they can expect another WashU confessions page to be set up, separate from yours.

All I am saying is, tell it for what it really is. Our school is full of liberals who get upset over the few and mild conservative opinions on here (I have yet to see a confession that says, "I hate black people". None are so horrid.) You say you believe in equality? You say you "believe in freedom of speech, but..." No! I am sorry but you do not believe in freedom of speech. Tell it for what it really is, whatever your beliefs, whatever your agenda, you do not believe in freedom at least not for conservatives, white males, the wealthy, the christian, etc. There's going to be backlash.
