I confess that I hate living in the Lofts and I wouldn't do it again if I had the chance to do it all over again. It's a building built on broken promises and shoddy work. Plus those who administer the buildings seems to have an overinflated sense of purpose. We are adults living in apartments, not children living in boarding school. I don't need security guards monitoring me or my activities, I don't need overzealous staff telling me what I can and can not do, and I certainly don't need the University pretending like they are doing anyone favors by "letting" us live here when half of the apartments are empty anyway. This is and was a waste of money.
