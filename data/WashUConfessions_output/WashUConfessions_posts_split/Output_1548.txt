Hey guys,

I need your advice. I have been talking to a guy from a lower socioeconomic class and it seems that although he is affectionate, he is oblivious to how offensive he can be.  He makes statements about me coming from a rich background because I went to a private school (not true at all), going to see a counselor (why go ask someone to tell you what to do as a grown adult), and being tolerant towards others who are different. Should I school him on his insensitivity or just let him go?
