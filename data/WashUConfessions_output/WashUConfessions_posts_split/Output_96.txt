I feel like I am finally, finally, FINALLY getting over my first breakup completely, and I am so glad. I haven't been in love with her since the summer, but I've been carrying around so much resentment and guilt that I've felt like all my worst qualities have been amplified this past semester - and then, just yesterday, I woke up and I felt wonderful. Not happy, but... content. For the first time in a very long time. I woke up and I felt like I could accept my mistakes and my screw-ups, in that relationship and in the rest of my life, and resolve to learn from them and become someone better. I feel like I can look at other people and imagine myself crushing on, getting to know, and loving someone again, rather than being reminded of the past and having my heart constrict. I made terrific progress on a huge project today, writing thousands and thousands of words, and while they might not be the best, I can always revise, and the fact that I could write without feeling paralyzed with anxiety or panic was amazing.

I am still fairly scared about the start of this semester, but for the first time in a very long time, I'm also elated.

And on the whole, this contentment, this possibility of love, this tenuous elation - all of it - is so, so beautiful to me.

I hope everyone has a wonderful semester. Good luck, and do your best. You will shine.
