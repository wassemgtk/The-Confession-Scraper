I went to a small, private high school, and most of the kids there were white. I was one of the only Indian kids in my entire school. Most of the students only liked other white students, and so I felt really unattractive, although when I look in the mirror I don't think I'm bad-looking.
I thought that coming here would be different, because there are so many different kinds of people. I know that it's not a right to be liked and found attractive, but I thought here would be different.
