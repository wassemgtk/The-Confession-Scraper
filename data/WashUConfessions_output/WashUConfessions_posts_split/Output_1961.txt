I am disappointed the Chancellor has made it clear that those who are feel the protests are counter-productive to real change are racists. It's upsetting that he nearly throws away the fact that there were two grand jury decisions to not indict. It's disheartening that he chose to side with the hashtag #blacklivesmatter instead of actually promoting #AllLivesMatter.

How many interviews have there been on television where protesters continually claim this isn't about race? They argue it's about a broken legal and governmental system--one of the haves vs. the have-nots. If this were really the case, and things weren't about race, the mantra would be #AllLivesMatter.

Every vine or news clip has shown a diverse group of protesters who were non-Black. Various groups came (and still do) together to support the cause. Where was the public outrage and support from the Black community for the hammer killing of the Bosnian by a group of minorities? Where was the outrage and support from the Black community for the Bosnian woman who was robbed and assaulted by a similar group?

Overall, I'm sad that so much effort is being wasted on marching for change when so few have clearly defined what change they want and how to go about achieving it. The Black community in Ferguson represented in the media made it clear time and time again that they were unhappy with their political representation. How can one fix that? A ~12% turnout in the most recent County elections is disgraceful when, since August, the group has complained of poor representation. This was a starting point in the mission for change and it was lost yet again like it is every year in St. Louis where the Black rate of voting is around 10-13%.

Instead of standing in the streets, blocking traffic, screaming obscenities at local and state law enforcement, there should have been a concerted effort by civil rights leaders and activists to get people registered to vote. Clergy and these groups should have organized resources to help get people to their polling locations or at minimum, tell them where to go and what to expect.

You want change? Hold your local leaders, aldermen, council members and so forth accountable. Go to local city meetings and participate in a respectful and mature manner--not just screaming over the top of people trying to get work done. Screaming "stop murdering us" and the like over and over doesn't result in change. It impedes work from getting done. Vote out the elected judges, sheriffs, mayors and alderman. Start contacting your state representatives for your districts and vote them out when they don't represent you. Get involved in your school boards and PTA meetings. Make sure your children are receiving an education that benefits them and improves the likelihood they can succeed in life. Run for local office yourself. The belief that change comes down from the federal level is just a dream. Your more likely to have something take place by affecting change on a local level (and maybe state to a degree).

Yes, all of these things take work. They take far more work and commitment than marching down a sidewalk or  boycotting Walmart. However, these are the things that will actually gain you lasting support from the community at large and will yield real results.
