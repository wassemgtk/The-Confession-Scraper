I confess that, as a young woman, I work out every morning. I work out so that my body will be strong, and so that my spirit will not break. I workout every day because physical strength is confidence, and confidence is freedom. I workout every god damned day for my defense and protection. I workout every day so that I can walk back to my off campus apartment alone and not be afraid of the people who stare, wink, whistle, follow, catcall, and tell me "damn baby girl, I'd love to bite me off a piece of that". I workout every day so that maybe I won't be a " that" or a "thing", but instead to be a me, she, her, a daughter, a sister, a friend. A human being. I workout everyday so that I can hold my head up high with pride at being a woman. I workout every day so that when I express my opinion, people won't side eye me, look me up and down, and then determine that " I don't really know what I'm talking about". I workout every day so that I can be met as an equal. I workout every day so that I don't have to shake and tremble as I write this, thinking about what I've gone through, and the worse things close friends of mine have endured because they too, are women. I workout every day to be safe. And, I workout every day to push back the fear and dread, knowing that even if I can someday become superwoman or a ninja or something else, something better, that will still not be enough. Because I am a woman.
