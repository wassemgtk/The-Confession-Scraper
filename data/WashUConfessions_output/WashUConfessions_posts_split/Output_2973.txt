I'm getting sick and tired about hearing about how Breaking Bad is such a good show. After having this show forced upon me by my peers, I'm still in awe that many of you refer to this show as the greatest of all time. Did the last episode blow you away? Well, let me ask you this? How can you like a show that is so completely irrelevant that it might as well have been produced in the 1950's? This show at no point deals with homosexual relationships, or even has a single homosexual character. It never deals with the issue of the gay homeless youth, or features a dominant transgender main character. TV by definition should push boundaries, and this show does nothing more than force traditional Christian values down our throats. Shame on you for watching this, and shame on Vince Jillian for not dealing with LGBT issues head on. I'm honesty ashamed to live in this country now.
