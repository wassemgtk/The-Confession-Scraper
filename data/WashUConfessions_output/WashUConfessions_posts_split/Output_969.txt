I'm so frustrated that so many guys at this school feel entitled to anything they want from girls. Even though they may take no for an answer, if a girl turns them down then they honestly believe something is wrong with her or she is just a bitch. I have felt this so many times, especially at fraternities (several in particular). These guys need to take a look in the mirror because girls probably have a very good reason for turning them down, especially that smug attitude. You are not entitled to anything from any girl, you have to go out there and show her that you are worth it and that she is worth it.
