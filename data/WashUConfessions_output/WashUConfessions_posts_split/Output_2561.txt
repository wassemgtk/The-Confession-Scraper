Ever since I got here, I've been in a sort of limbo. I know this is a great school and I am beyond fortunate to come here, but every night when I go to bed, all I want is to be home. I miss my family and friends so much that I often cry myself to sleep. It's not that I've not tried to branch out and make new friends here-I have definitely done so and have met some great people. But still, it's hard to connect when so much of the social gatherings that happen revolve around alcohol or hooking up. I don't have a problem with either one if anyone wants to do it-that's their own business. But I personally have found that it is hard to connect when you're not part of that culture.
On top of finding it hard to fit in socially, academics have been far harder than I expected. I'm not doing nearly as well as I hoped, I feel stupid compared to everyone else, I am feeling overwhelmed by commitments, and I just don't want to be the small fish in a very, very big pond. Sometimes I wonder if I made the right decision in coming here. I don't want to sound ungrateful or anything, but I just feel like I'm the only one whose transition into college hasn't been great.
