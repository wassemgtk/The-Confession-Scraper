I met a really nice guy in my first semester chem lab and we hit it off after struggling through labs together. we went on a few dates and i even had my first kiss with him in the snow, go figure. however, i broke it off because i wanted to be able to hook up with other guys and not be tied down my first year of college. also, i wasn't sure if i liked him romantically. but now, after multiple hookups, I'm not sure if I made the right decision...i really screwed up this time. to the person i'm referring to, you're a great guy and i made a mistake.
