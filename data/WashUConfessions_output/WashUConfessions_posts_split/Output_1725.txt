You know how people/ the media always says that girls turn down boys. Girls friend zone boys and so on. It gives the perception that boys chase after girls. I'm a girl and I feel like I've been friend zoned and not been doing the friend zoning. I love my guy friends, but I definitely think they put me in the friend zone first. I know it must go both ways, but media makes me feel like I'm doing something wrong. It's frustrating to see all these posts on all kinds of websites and in TV shows and movies that the women are the one with the power over men. I know this is not how my life works. I just wonder if other people are in my position too. I have awesome friends, but I never date. I mean I don't know if I would want to date my guy friends, but not dating at all does not seem like the right thing either. I don't know how to not be friend zoned.
