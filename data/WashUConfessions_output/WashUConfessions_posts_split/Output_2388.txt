I know there are plenty of great Greek organizations on campus and I really love my own, but my best friend joined a sorority that has turned her into the worst version of herself and it's made me seriously question Greek life as a whole. Because of the influence of those girls she's become catty, shallow, and stuck-up. She spends all her time dirty rushing pretty freshmen (she'll even trash my sorority in front of me) because she's been told that's how her chapter will win recruitment. And when she came home a few weeks ago on the verge of alcohol poisoning from their "sophomore hazing night" not a single one of her so-called sisters bothered to help take care of her or even check to see if she was okay. Honestly I'm so torn because I want her to be happy, but I don't know how to tell her that her sorority is making her into someone I can't consider a friend.
