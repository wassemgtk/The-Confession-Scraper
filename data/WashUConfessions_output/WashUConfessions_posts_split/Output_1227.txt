For the first time in my life I'm a member of my religion who ISN'T in good standing. I think about it every day and wonder how I let it get this far that I haven't been to church since January. It's paralyzing to think about all the changes I'd have to make in order to be in good standing again. But then I think about all the things I'd have to give up and it doesn't seem worth it. Since I went inactive, I've been able to spend the night in my boyfriend's arms, take my first shot with my friends, and not constantly worry about how much skin my clothes are revealing. It's freeing to be out from under the thumb of my church. As much as it hurts to say it, I don't think I'll ever be active again because I love my life so much better without my church.
