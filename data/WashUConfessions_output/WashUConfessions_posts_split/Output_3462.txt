Going off of #365, everyone should check out the band Ludo. They're not exactly up and coming as they're already pretty popular, but definitely not as popular as they should be. The lead singer, Andrew Volpe, went to Wash U for a while before dropping out and the band is from St. Louis. Their music has done a lot for me and I hope you guys enjoy it too!
