Hey everyone out there who's struggling, who's feeling the pinch of loneliness, or who feels like things aren't going the way you want them to go. Remember that you matter and you bring something valuable to the university and to the world. I think that while we live in a place where supporting each other is essential, we also don't tend to let people know as often as we should that we appreciate them. I'm not sure how much this matters, coming from a stranger, but I'm cheering for all of you.
