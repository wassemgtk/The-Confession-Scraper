I'm a black female and I've come to the realization that don't have many black girl friends at WashU. I have some involvement in the black community and have some black friends here, but most of my closest friends are of different races. I don't see myself as racist towards my own race or hiding my blackness, but I just have a different personality than a lot of black girls here. I'd like to make some more black friends, but it seems as if a lot of friend groups have already been established.
