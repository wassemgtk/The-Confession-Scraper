What the brothers of SAE participated in is a hate crime: A hate crime is a category used to describe bias-motivated violence: "assault, injury, and murder on the basis of certain personal characteristics: different appearance, different color, different nationality, different language, different religion." "Hate crime" generally refers to criminal acts that are seen to have been motivated by bias against one or more of the types above, or of their derivatives. Incidents may involve physical assault, damage to property, bullying, harassment, verbal abuse or insults, or offensive graffiti or letters (hate mail). I am truly appalled that this happened on WashUs campus, but if they felt it okay to verbally attack people publicly, I'm truly concerned about the basis of their" brotherhood" behind closed doors. Legal action should be taken, and I'm not sorry about what happens to their organization, as I am beyond disgusted and offended. My confession: I don't feel comfortable/safe on this campus anymore.
