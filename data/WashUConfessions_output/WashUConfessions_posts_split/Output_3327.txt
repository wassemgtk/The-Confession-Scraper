I think WUFI/WUFI-S is the reason I can't enjoy studying/hanging out in different places on campus. I am almost always on the internet, and I know a lot of you are too. This is not just an "Omg I can't go on facebook" post but rather a serious problem given the era we live in. I obtain most of the information I need from internet. But the fact that I have to spend 15 minutes just to be able to browse for 30 seconds frustrates me, and I rather access internet using an ethernet cord than look like a crazed monkey that suffers from banana deprivation in Stanley's.
