Got told by someone I care very much about that I have a drug abuse problem. And she's not wrong. I abuse drugs. Maybe it's college. Maybe it's a problem. I don't even know enough about where I am on that specturm to say. It involves all types, from booze to weed to psychedelics to benzos to stimulants. Some are for fun, some are to not have to deal, and a lot of times it feels like that line gets blurred every Friday and Saturday (and let's be real, most Thursday nights too). 

Used to smoke almost every day but then it stopped being fun and I admitted to that last week. I'm not stopping entirely, I'm just cutting back, and I've talked to enough professionals and been in enough groups to know that pretty much every addict says that, and so do people who don't have a problem. The (non-scientific, experience-based) definition of addiction is surprisingly unclear, even amongst recovering addicts. Everyone has their own line, is what I've found. Almost everyone who talks about addiction says "oh this is or isn't addictive". What makes something addictive, has, in my own experience, been something that fills a missing space that nothing else, substance or otherwise, could. It has very little to do with whether or not that substance is known to cause chemical dependency. I don't want to stop because it's fun, but I've started noticing a pattern that I keep letting the people I care most about down and hurting them through my use of one substance or another. Maybe if I just toned it down. Maybe if I just stopped all-together. 

My worry is summed up in a saying recovering addicts have: "It wasn't a problem until it was a problem". The lines between a hard partier and someone who is damaging themselves are razor thin, and the various contradictory societal perceptions of drug and alcohol use don't help at all. I already lost one friendship because of my use, but my other friends (who don't use) say that person was overreacting. I don't think the person was. But really, I don't know what to think.

I apologize for the stream of consciousness. Just had to get it out of my head.
