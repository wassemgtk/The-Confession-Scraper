I went out for the first time in months over the weekend with a group of people, most of whom I'm not very close with, who spent a solid amount of time talking about their antisocial roommates who don't have friends and bring food back to their rooms every night rather than eating with other people. Ever since then I've been sad because that describes me perfectly. I have a really hard time being social and reaching out to people, and it really hurts to hear that kind of talk.

Please think twice before saying potentially rude things about others and before making judgments, and try to give them the benefit of the doubt. You never know how the things you say will affect others.
