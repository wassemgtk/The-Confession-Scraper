Passion. That's what this school is missing. We are definitely in a rut. Work M-F, party Saturday, homework all day Sunday, repeat. It's boring. Can we all just be a little more chill? Yes, classes suck, but that doesn't mean we can't enjoy college. Try new things, meet new people. I wasted college because I was always so focused on life after college. I didn't take the time to enjoy the things going on around me. Don't make the same mistake! Carpe that fucking diem
