My mom is an alcoholic, and I'm afraid that I can't save her. She won't even admit that she has a problem, but my whole family knows it. Every night, i confront her about it, but we fight every time I say something. Her drunkedness is really altering her mood, making her extremely angry or loopy. I can't take seeing her like this anymore. She's my mom, but I feel like I have to take care of her. Except I don't know how to take care of her because she has always been the one taking care of me. I know you shouldn't help people that don't want to be helped, but she's my frickin mom. I have to help her. Advice please!
