I think my girlfriend kind of assumes that we'll live together after we graduate. I'm not so sure how to bring up the fact that I'd rather not officially live together with a significant other until we're married. I mean, we've been dating for a few years but I feel like saying something like that will send the wrong impression. Any suggestions?
