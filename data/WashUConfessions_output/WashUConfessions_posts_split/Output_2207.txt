I don't have friends here. I used to have accompanies, but I figured out  that I don't actually enjoy spending time with them: I can't get the real conversations I want from normal friends, and I get more and more frustrated with their company. Therefore I deserted myself, yet I do feel lonely: I literally have no conversations expect for the necessary interactions in class with classmates and professors.

I went through a bad week, and today is especially terrible: I went to bed at 6 a.m. the day before yesterday, haven't slept at all yesterday, and this evening, just when I thought I could finally have a break, I discovered that one of my professors, who I really like and admire, is actually furious about me and labeled me "the most disrespectful student seen in her 18 teaching years". I was in horror, since I never meant anything disrespectful, and I am just so ashamed and frustrated that  I spent an hour lying on the floor between the shelves in the library. I was just broken down for a while. I cried a little bit about this, then a lot about my whole messed up life this semester. Yet when I returned home, my suit mates don't even bother to say hi, just as always. We had some not-so-pleasant conversations about a box of shared eggs, and neither of them noticed that I am dejected and apparently have just cried on my way home.

I am also struggling academically, which is my own fault, but sometimes I feel I am so broken down inside that it is incredibly hard to muster the mental strength required to survive Wash U.

I guess things WILL turn better: not actually better, but more and more bearable, as I will get used to it as time passes. Thank you for reading this: just imagining about people reading my words gives me strength to pull through tonight.
