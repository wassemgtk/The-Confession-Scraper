The pencils in the grass during mental health awareness thing hit me just a little harder now. Someone I knew from back home posted a suicide note as his facebook status and killed himself.

He wasn't a friend. We just never were really close. The main thing I remember is how much he was bullied. I'm sure there were times I participated, even if I don't remember specifically. I know that I can't change it, but what if I hadn't, what if I had been better?

I see kids interact pretty regularly, and it's getting harder and harder. I see them playing out what I experienced. I can't stop them from hurting one another, and they haven't had enough time to learn just how much words hurt.

All of this just makes my heart hurt. I wish I could help more than I do, I wish I could change what I did and who I was. But I also just wish that this bright, enthusiastic kid I knew wouldn't become a part of the worst statistic for me to hear.
