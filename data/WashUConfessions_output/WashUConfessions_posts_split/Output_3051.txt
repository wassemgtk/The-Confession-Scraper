I'm worried that even with counseling, I won't make it through this year without having to drop out of WashU to get serious medical help for all my mental health issues. And I'm worried that even if I make it through graduation, Ill still have to worry forever down the road, because I dont know that I can ever lead a life where I'm comfortable, happy, and not scared all the time.
