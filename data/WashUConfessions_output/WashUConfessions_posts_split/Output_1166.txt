I'm a female non-sexual escort and I am nearing graduation. Recently, I was just offered my first real job in my major. My boyfriend wants me to take the job, marry him, and abandon this life I've had for two years. He has a house outside of the city, a steady living, and he loves me (obviously, since he has accepted my job choice until now).

I really don't want to give up this adventure I've been living. Honestly, I don't think I will give it up. I have my own cute little place off campus that I'm not ready to leave. It's in the middle of St. Louis, and my home and my job makes me feel so connected to this city-- to the nice, clean, wealthy places and to the people who are completely preoccupied merely with survival. Honestly, the part of it that gets me the most is the number of damn interesting conversations I never would have had if I hadn't become a escort. Maybe I am emotionally polyamorous and I can't settle down. I just wish I hadn't decided to be with someone who makes me feel like what I am, what I feel that I truly am, is a phase.

It would be nice to know if there were other people who felt afraid of what they were becoming, because they weren't prepared for what they would become for majority of the years they've spent on this planet.
