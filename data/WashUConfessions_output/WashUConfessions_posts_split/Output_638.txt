I love WashU, if only for the simple reason that I'm taking a Japanese Civilization class taught by an 80 year old Jewish man who is without a doubt the most passionate and hilarious man I have a class with. Wait, I have the British professor who roasts the one kid who shouts out answers too. I love WashU.
