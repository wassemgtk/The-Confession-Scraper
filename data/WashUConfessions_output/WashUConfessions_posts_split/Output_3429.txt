I'm really getting sick of frat boys. Not all of you, just the obnoxious ones. This isn't exactly a shining moment for fraternities; stop acting like you're cooler than everyone else and have the right to be obnoxious and publicly harass others. When you act like a douche, it doesn't make you look cool. It makes you look like a douche.
