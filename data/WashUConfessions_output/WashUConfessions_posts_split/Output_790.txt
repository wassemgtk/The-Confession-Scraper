I confess that I would detest receiving all the emails Wash. U. sends over the summer, were they not implicitly reminders that with each passing day, I am closer to finishing college.

I now realize much of my reasoning for coming to Wash. U. was misguided or even, in some cases, wrong.

A professor I liked who ultimately talked me into coming turned out to be a complete jerk. I was duped into believing Wash. U. was a friendly community: my female colleagues and I face seemingly relentless sexual harassment in math and science settings by both peers and professors. Worst of all, I'm not getting myself the education I thought I could, and I'm not sure it is possible to find it at Wash. U.

I almost wish I hadn't chosen to come here.
