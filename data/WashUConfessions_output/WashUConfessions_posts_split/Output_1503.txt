I feel like WashU students are not truly genuine people. Whenever I speak to people, even close friends on campus, I feel as though I am being lied too. People here they say things to try to look smart and fit in, but do not actually truthfully communicate with me. This always occurs, I would truly like to actually meet a person, just one person who would just say what was on his/her mind instead of playing into political correctness, and affecting themselves with a fake personality. I mean we are in college we should all be more expressive with our thoughts even if they are offensive!
