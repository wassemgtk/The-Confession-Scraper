I did so poorly this semester that I might be failing a course as well as getting put on academic probation and it's absolutely crippling me. I know my problems are so small compared to the grand scheme of things, but it sucks to be held back by your own depression so greatly that you can't excel at the things you used to enjoy. I'm getting help, but I wish I would've done this before I screwed up so hard.
