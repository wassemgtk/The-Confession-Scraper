Sometimes I feel like someone is watching everything-- my Facebook posts, Twitter, YikYak, etc.
I thought it was just paranoia at first but, after the allegations of NSA spying.... the truth is just too hard to bear
Now I think the Administration is in bed with the NSA and collecting all... ALL...our information.

Now is the time to disconnect, and plug off.
