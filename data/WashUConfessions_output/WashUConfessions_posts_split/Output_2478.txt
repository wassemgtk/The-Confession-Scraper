When I told my father I was gay, he didn't yell at me, he didn't tell me that he was disappointed (but I knew).  He told me that he didn't think being gay was a path to happiness.  But here's the thing:  I'm in love with my wonderful boyfriend and I'm happier now than my dad ever was.  Point is, don't be afraid to disappoint people. Be the best damn disappointment you can be.
