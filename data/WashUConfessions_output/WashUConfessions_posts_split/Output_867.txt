To the extrovert with social anxiety from confession #2927:

I identify as a shy extrovert (because shy-outgoing and introvert-extrovert are two different spectrums!!), and I totally feel what you're saying.  I often have to give myself little pep talks before I enter new social situations to make myself go, but it almost always pays off because I end up enjoying myself and feeding off the social energy as a classic extrovert!  

My advice is to give yourself that pep talk and put yourself out there. Greet people you only kind of know, make plans with new people, talk to strangers, be friendly!  There are SO many friends I wouldn't have made if I hadn't made myself be the outgoing one even though I'm shy.  I know it's hard when what will make you happy also gives you severe anxiety - it might be easier if you felt one person to go out into new situations with, to give you a familiar anchor while you go meet new people.  But, I think overal you'll end up enjoying the fresh social energy and make new friends!  Good luck, and I wish I hadn't just graduated or else I could become your new friend too.  :)
