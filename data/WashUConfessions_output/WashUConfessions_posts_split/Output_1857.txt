I hate the almost automatic "How was your break?" "Great, yours?" "Great!". Especially because, well, what if you didn't have a great and awesome break and instead you really hated it? It's interesting that no one ever says they're break was bad because no one wants to hear negativity; we always expect positivism and the best. Can we change that, so its completely fine that I say I hated my break and hated going home?
