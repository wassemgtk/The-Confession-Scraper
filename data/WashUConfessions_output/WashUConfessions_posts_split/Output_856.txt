I'm honestly impressed with the people that find the courage to post on this page, or any other anonymous sharing platform for that manner. There are plenty of things I'd like to say, but I'm nearly certain that if I did write and submit them I'd easily be identified - if not for the subject matter, just for my particular style of writing. Maybe I'm just paranoid.
