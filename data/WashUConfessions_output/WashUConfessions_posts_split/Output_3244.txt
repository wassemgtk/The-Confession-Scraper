As much as I've come to love WashU, I still can't stand the pre-med vibe of this place. People just define themselves by a few test scores in some rat-race that becomes more a crapshoot every year, forcing themselves to memorize through something like glycolysis or hounding Chem Lab TAs for lab answers, without just looking up for even a second and just appreciating the beauty of these complex structures and ideas -- the stuff of life. It seems like the culture here is all about just procrastinating, complaining about how difficult tests are (which they normally aren't, by the way), then just getting smashed on the weekends to forget about it all. What's happened to being intellectual, or doing something bigger for the world? It all just seems so foolish and selfish.
