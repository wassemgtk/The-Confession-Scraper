I confess that I'm a senior I've never read a book all the way through - thus never read a book for fun. I just got into med school and I've always gotten good grades, but I simply never cared to do the readings. I'd usually use sparknotes or get my friend's notes and that's how I generally passed English. I didn't post this to be judged (even though I know I will be). I posted this to ask for help. I honestly don't know where to start and I feel much to dumb to ask for help now. I've never told ANYONE this. Sooo yea.....
