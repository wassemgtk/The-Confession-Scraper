I miss the old WashU Confessions admin. Nothing against the new one, and I'm sure they will do a great job, but I felt like I got to know him a little, through what he posted as the anonymous admin, and I've even messaged the account personally a few times. Now that he's gone, I feel like I've lost a friend since I have no way of hearing from him again.
