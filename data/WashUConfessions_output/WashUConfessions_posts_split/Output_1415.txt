You may not see this, but, firstly I want to congratulate the person who mentioned that they are a year clean from self-harm: this is no easy feat. I am proud of you. Secondly, I have also been struggling with myself as a person and struggling with being happy with whatever I have and was wondering if anyone has any suggestions on how to keep fighting and to make things better.
Thanks
