My boyfriend recently broke up with me. About a year and a half ago, he gave me a heart necklace, and since then I've worn it every day while were dating. I'd put it on when I left my apartment in the morning, and take it off every day before bed. When he broke up with me, I gave him the necklace back. This was over a month ago. When I'm very tired, I sometimes still reach for the necklace as I'm getting ready for bed.
