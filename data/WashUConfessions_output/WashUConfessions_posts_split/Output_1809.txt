As a gay man, I'm honestly convinced that being gay is a choice. I genuinely was attracted to females my whole life, and then a year ago, I chose to try something new. i now am only attracted to men (which I was not before) but I believe i could choose to go back at any point (I'm not bisexual). Just my personal opinion, but from experience I can tell you it;s a choice!
