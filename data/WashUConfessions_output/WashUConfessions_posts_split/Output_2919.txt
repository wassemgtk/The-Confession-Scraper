I feel alone here, but I am not an introvert and you you wouldn't guess if you saw me around. Self-applauding aside, I go to class for the most part, I look put together (not necessarily am put together but aren't we all), I exchange greetings with people I know if I walk by them, I strike up conversations with classmates, but I just have not connected with anyone in the way that I see could progress into a life long friendship. On weekends, I flit between social groups/frat houses/off campus parties that I am friendly with and welcomed by, but non of the relationships go past drinking/smoking/having a good old party time. To avoid loneliness and fulfill sexual needs, I hook up with a guy every so often but it does not progress much further than fuck buddy, which I am ok with. I do not want a boyfriend (btdt) but I do hope that I can find a true friend here, the kind of lifelong friend that everyone says you find in college. "Join a club to meet people with similar interests" you say. I actually participated in a handful last year, my freshman year, but I honestly just didn't find the ladder-climbing "I am taking this leadership position to put on my resume" attitude of many of the students in charge of the groups that engaging. As "oh you're that kind of kid" as this sounds, I am ok with spending a reasonable amount of time studying for my classes, which is another personal decision I made that I am ok with (in reference to the fuck buddy thing ). If I transferred or took medical leave, others would recognize my name as someone who left but I don't think I would actually be missed all that much. I am writing this not to complain but just sharing with you the daily situation I live. Sometimes it feels that between the very "tight" student groups such as Greek life, executive boards of cultural groups, music ensembles etc end of the spectrum and the happy introvert end of the spectrum, there is not much of a middle ground...but hey I am here! Thanks for reading and please share any thoughts you have. Good luck with all your midterms, which I likewise have and am putting off studying for by writing my heart out to you in a Survey Monkey. TLDR: No fuck you it'll take 1 minute of your procrastination to read it if you want <3
