I just transferred here this semester from California and it's super difficult to make friends, especially since I live off campus with my family. I try very hard. I make light hearted jokes while waiting in line on campus and people look away. I start up random conversations with people (like, "how are you liking the class?") and after some one worded answers they just keep walking without the slightest goodbye. Don't get me wrong, I am so happy to be with my family again. But it gets to me after five weeks of trying when no one has even bothered to ask my name.

I don't think of myself as unapproachable either. I'm a 5'4 attractive young woman who dresses fairly well. I don't think that there's anything wrong with me. But I really thought I would've made friends by now.
