I am incredibly prejudiced when it comes to my safety - I judge strangers based on their clothing, mannerisms, haircut, race, and location (for example, the Loop versus on campus) and will often avoid people I think may be dangerous, especially on or north of the Loop at night. I do this for my own safety and I see nothing wrong with this. It's fair to say that I'm prejudiced, judgmental, or even racist, but I'll be damned if I ever let myself get mugged again.
