I confess that I'm openly gay but not out-there-in-your-face gay. I really want to pursue relationships with guys (all kinds: hookups to dating) but I don't know how to meet people or let people know I'm interested in guys without being uncomfortable and making a big deal of my sexuality. Also, it's hella hard to meet guys on this campus who 1. are gay 2. are attractive 3. are attracted to me. I see gay couples together on social media and around campus all the time, and I see guys hooking up at parties, but I have no clue how that stuff initialized. Help a brother out?
