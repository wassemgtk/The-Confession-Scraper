I really hate dates.  They freak me out.  I know a lot of people use them as a way of finding out if they want to be in a relationship with a person.  But going on dates makes me feel like I should be super interesting and always have something witty to say.  At the end of the night I feel obligated to make out and or sleep with the person I'm with even if I don't particularly feel anything for them after spending 3 or so hours together.  Even when I do go out with a person I already like, I get super nervous and just want to leave.
