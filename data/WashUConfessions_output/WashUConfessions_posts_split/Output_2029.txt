I confess that I'm a middle-class white guy who has only relatively recently recognized the presence of systemic racism.  I'm not apologizing for my position in life, but I'm realizing that it's my responsibility to learn as much as I can about this issue, because with understanding comes empathy, compassion, and love.  Would anyone with a good understanding of the history of systemic racism sit down and have a conversation with me so I can better understand why things are the way they are today?
