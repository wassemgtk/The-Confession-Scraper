I can't stand how people automatically assume that if your family is well off, or if you aren't on financial aid at this school, or whatever, that that means you haven't had to work for anything in your life, or that you got in here just because your family could pay for it. I come from a family with money, but I still had a job all throughout high school, and even here I spend my own money when I want things. Of course I recognize my privilege and the fact that many things in my life have been made easier because my family can support me financially and provide me with the resources I need. However, I got into Wash U because of my hard work in high school, which was my own, and did not have to do with my family's financial situation. I continue to succeed thanks to MY work. I work hard in school just like everyone else. I have overcome hardship just like everyone else.

On a different note, my parents and grandparents worked hard to achieve success so that they could support their children and make a better life for their family. Isn't that exactly what most of us are at this school trying to do? It makes no sense to try to make someone feel guilty about the fact that their family has already done this for them.

No person, rich or poor, is better than one another. But just like it is inappropriate to shame someone for their lack of money, it is equally inappropriate to shame someone for being financially well-off. Do not invalidate the hard work of either them or their family.
