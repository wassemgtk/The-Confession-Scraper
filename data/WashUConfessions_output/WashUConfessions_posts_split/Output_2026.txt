I confess that I hate all those international applicants. Don't get me wrong: I have no problem with anyone holding any passport. I am not a chauvinist or something. The problem is, I am an Asian, and all those international applicants are pushing the bar super high for us. I am not in math or science - my major has an average GRE Math of below 160 even for top schools, but as an Asian no one thinks I'm impressive even after I've gotten a perfect 170. Same thing for GPA. I really don't know how those universities grade their students but it seems that every one of them has a 3.9. And then most of them have limited research experience, mediocre rec letters, and most importantly, can't write or speak in comprehensible English - something that is vital for my field. So most of them are not getting in, and most of those who get in are qualified students - I have no problem of admitting them. However the legacy those unqualified students leaves is that year after year we Asians are being held to a higher standard than anyone else gradewise in applications. It's not official research  - I mean who would release this sort of data it's arguably discrimination - but really Asian students need to score a lot higher than everyone else to be considered equally good as everyone else.
This is unfair. This is hurting us. We struggled as much as everyone else in every class to accomplish whatever we have accomplished. People tease us as nerds, as unattractive, as socially awkward, but after we join student groups, frats/sororities, volunteer causes and thus spent less (i.e. and then equal to everyone else's) amount studying, we are punished for getting worse (comparing to what they have used to and comparing to those international students who really do not have as big a pressure to social) grades. What should we do?
