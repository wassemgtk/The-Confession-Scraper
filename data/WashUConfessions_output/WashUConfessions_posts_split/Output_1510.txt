I just got off the phone with my dad. The topic was money.

I'm crushed. I wanna break down and cry. Lack of money is crushing me.

My dad demands that I receive all B's or better (which is manageable and doable, but still hard), but he also expects $5000 from me (I have about $200 to my name) and I'm trying to get a job to at least do something.

I told him I found a house off campus for ~$830 a month. He freaked out, like really freaked out. Until I told him that the cheapest washu housing was the same amount except for 8.5 or 9 months.

Honestly I can handle school. I can handle the loneliness and the workload of WashU. I can't handle the money. I can't handle having it constantly looming over me. And yet, the only thing I can do is keep trying. If I don't at least try I'm doomed to fail.

I know we all work hard to be here, but sometimes it feels like WashU is trying to bash down those of us who can't afford the WUrld.
