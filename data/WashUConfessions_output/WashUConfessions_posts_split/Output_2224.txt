I didn't deserve to be accepted here. The only reason I feel like I was is because I am currently paying full tuition, with no scholarships (given from WashU). Although WashU was my dream school, I definitely do not feel smart enough to go here. I have constantly struggled to do well in classes, and have NEVER felt confident coming out of an exam relating to my major, or for my core classes. 

As an engineer, sometimes I feel like maybe it is just this particular path I chose to take, but I honestly think that I would struggle in any other major just as much because of the general rigor or this institution. I constantly feel guilty because my parents are paying so much for me to attend, and I am always letting them down with my academic performance. It may seem like I am just not working hard enough, but my friends criticize me actually for how much I am constantly working and studying. I feel incredibly lucky to go here everyday because WashU is everything and more I hoped it would be. I just constantly let myself and my parents down because deep down, I know I should not have been accepted in the first place.
