As an alum, I can honestly say WashU was the best 4 years of my life thus far. That's not to say that the road afterwards isn't just as great -- it, like always has been, what you make of it; and you should invest yourself into what you love. 

The road after graduation is difficult to navigate, and let me tell you, grad school is like freshman year all over again (except without the free Ted Drewes and the tempurpedic beds). It's tough. Your life after school is about taking the memories, skills, and moments from WashU and applying them to become the best version of you. I would be lying if I said that was easy after graduation. But the fun is in the challenge, I promise. But for now, whether you're a freshman or a senior, enjoy everything: the easy and the tough classes, the failures and the successes, the loves and the losts. They make you who you are. 

Don't graduate without regrets (yes, climb on top of those buildings, DO IT -- star gazing is awesome), sled down Art Hill, and stay up late talking to friends. Start your St. Louis bucket list and get your friends to check off things!! It's worth it. You'll look back on your four years and wonder how you could have chosen any other path. It simply wouldn't have made you this happy.
