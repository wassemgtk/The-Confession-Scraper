A few months ago I met one of the Ferguson police officers who was almost murdered the other day.  He was a patient, gentle and kind man who treated everyone with respect and dignity.  I wish the campus community would support him and his partner, but everyone is strangely silent about recent events because they don't fit the right "narrative".  It's heartbreaking.
