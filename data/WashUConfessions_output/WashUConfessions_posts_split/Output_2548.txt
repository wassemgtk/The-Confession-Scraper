There are simply not enough hours in a day, and sometimes I need to resort to all-nighters in order to make sure I don't ruin my life and fail my classes. I think this is necessary to make sure I hand everything in by the deadline, and thinking back to all of the times I have pulled all-nighters, I would've been worse off now, if I hadn't decided to skip sleep those fateful nights. I'm pulling an all-nighter now, but I haven't made much progress on any of my assignments, instead I just cried like a madman.
Now, it's 4:30 am, and I'm contemplating sleeping and trying to finish them all tomorrow, which might not be possible and I might actually fail the class in the process. but I'll go to bed anyway because I can't be productive now.
It's odd how there's this facade of safety and tranquility in academic life, while it's just walking on an endless tightrope in a hurricane with no safety net, and a never-ending shower of bird droppings, where one mistake basically means the end of your life, no matter how successful you were once before.
