I was one of those kids in high school that only asked people how they did on the ACT so I could tell them about my good scores. I didn't actually give a shit about what they got on the test. I just needed to show that my brain's dick was bigger than their brain's dick. I now sit in my dorm room at 10PM on a Saturday coming up with clever brain dick jokes to get some sweet anonymous Facebook likes.
