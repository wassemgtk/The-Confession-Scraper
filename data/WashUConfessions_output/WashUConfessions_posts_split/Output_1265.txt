sh U!

Someone has created a Wash U Soapbox page for sharing perspectives on social issues. It is being run separately from Confessions, and it should be a great place for sharing anonymous political views to an audience that is open to that sort of discussion. Having a page dedicated solely to political perspectives could be a great resource for the community and a breath of fresh air for the Confessions page. 

After having talked with the Soapbox admin over the past few days, I think he'll be a great fit for running the page. Some of the more politically-charged submissions sent to Confessions may be sent over to Soapbox, where they'll be served to a more willing and accepting audience. 

I recommend checking out the Soapbox page if you're interested in finding a community where political views can be shared safely. Giving Soapbox my support and wishing them the best of luck!
