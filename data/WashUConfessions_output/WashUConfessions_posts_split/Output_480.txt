People have this strange assumption that if one of your parents or both happen to be a doctor, you're automatically well off. Life isn't like that, especially when you have 3 siblings in college and these colleges and the government have the same view as the people who assume that you're well off because you have a physician parent. College tuitions and taxes add up and with federal loans not being an option, we are not "rolling in it". You can have a physician parent and have your house mortgaged as we do. Life isn't as easy as the cover may make it seem.
