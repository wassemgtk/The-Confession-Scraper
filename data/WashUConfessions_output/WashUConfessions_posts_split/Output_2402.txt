I confess that my experiences at Wash U are reminiscent of an experience at McDonalds. They show you the "menu" with happy students, a beautiful campus, and "tons" of activities for student to get involved in. Happy students- scarce at best. Granted the campus is beautiful, but when you're advised not to venture too far beyond, you're bound to get tired of it. As for student activities, if you are a pre-med or engineering there are tons of options for you. If not, you're like a vegetarian who for some inconceivable reason goes to McDonalds to enjoy a meal.

I was thoroughly disappointed with my freshman experience, and though I came into this year optimistically, my enthusiasm is long gone. I feel that I've been tricked into purchasing a meal that cannot possibly live up to the high expectations set for it. I know the University couldn't care less about my opinions, and that nothing will change, but if someone on staff is reading these, please please consider paying more attention to a humanities department, or a foreign language department. We're students here too... And as I always say, everyone deserves to enjoy their McDonalds.
