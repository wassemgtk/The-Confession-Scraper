I confess that I am still surprised there is no "Remember when Wash U was fun?" Facebook page yet. Good thing the school went to an off-campus party and arrested its own students! And then expected me to attend the school-sponsored, off-campus "get to know your neighbors" barbecue the next day! This is all some big joke, right?
