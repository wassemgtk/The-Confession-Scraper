I confess that I maybe homeless soon and I'm more than concerned. My family has gone through a lot in the past few months and there are many people staying with my mother right now. She asked me could I stay at school for a bit during winter break and I mistakenly told her yes because I assumed it wouldn't be a problem. I didn't know that Wash U charges you $50 a night to do so. My mother isn't a doctor or a lawyer and we don't have that kind of money. I don't want to take this to my mom because she has enough on her plate without me taking back promises. Is there anyone here I can talk to about staying in my dorm for a bit longer and possibly coming back early?
