As someone who's gone to three colleges before Washu I can honestly say that I don't want to smell your pot. I was seriously disappointed to see some of my good friends like that post about uplifting the marijuana policies; and I'm even more disappointed that such prestigious premed students haven't looked at any of the latest research on the damages that marijuana does do to you, especially to a woman and her eggs. I mean have you ever even spoken to a pothead? You have to look in the other direction to not notice that they've gotten dumber since you knew them before they started smoking.
