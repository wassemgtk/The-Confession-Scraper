So I'm taking my daily "fuck chemistry, my head hurts and I don't get this anyway so I'm taking a break" procrastination shit during class, and as usual I bust out my phone (remember when we didn't have smartphones when we pooped? life was the worst.) Well anyway I'm absolutely destroying my loser friend in this racing game. Beat him like 25 games in a row, at least (I was in the bathroom awhile, you can blame last night's taco bell run for that lol.) So by this point I'm getting pretty bored of this game and go to tweet at my lame ass friends in class about how wash u screws us pre-meds over and i'm just gonna go join the b-school because like who really wants to get up for class on friday anyway?? but all of a sudden I see I have a snap chat and of course I'm thinking pleasebeboobspleasebeboobspleasebeboobs (but just kidding cuz this is wash u and fun things like that never happen) but then I see its from my loser friend whose ass I was just kicking. I open it up and he's trying to be all badass by flipping me off and I'm all like, dude you're a sore loser. Then I get this HILARIOUS idea that I'm gonna snap chat him my poop. Unfortunately, Wash U makes this pretty difficult with the whole autosensor flushers (glad to know my tuition isn't being wasted on such completely unnecessary things!) So i'm messing around for awhile, trying to get the right angle so that i'm blocking the sensor but still getting the poop with enough lighting, when all of a sudden I hear someone slam the stall door next to me shut. Well this catches me completely off guard because I didn't know anyone was in the bathroom and I've been making a lot of weird grunting noises trying to get in position for this legendary snap chat and in my nervous reaction I drop my phone right down between my spread out legs. Talk about a shitty phone... needless to say, #FUCKYOUTACOBELLSHITS
