This afternoon, sitting in Olin, I found myself thinking that the obnoxious pop-punk in my headphones seemed distant and quiet. Rather than investigate, I credited the bad sound to inferior Apple engineering and inevitable hearing loss. A few minutes later, I felt an angry hand on my shoulder and looked up to see a small crowd gathered. I removed the headphones, only to realize that I was treating the 2nd floor to Hungarian easycore at full blast. Sorry dudes.
