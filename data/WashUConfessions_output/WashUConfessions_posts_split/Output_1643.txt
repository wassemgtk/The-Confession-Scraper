Some of my friends don't realize how poor I am, and that I work three jobs to pay for college because my family survives on food stamps and can't help me at all. I do psychology experiments so I can get extra cash and be able to go out with my friends, but I just don't have enough money. I order the cheapest thing, and I try to tip when I can, but financially, I'm simply not able to. It's hard because I wish people would understand, but I'm too ashamed to tell anyone about my situation.
