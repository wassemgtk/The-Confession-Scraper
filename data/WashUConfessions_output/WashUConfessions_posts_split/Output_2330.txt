To the asshole who dumped everyone's laundry on the floor of Lopata House:

We get it. Your laundry is important. Very important. There was absolutely no way your dirty clothes could have waited another five minutes for a machine. That's totally cool.

What's also totally cool is the fact that you thought it would be okay to just go ahead and dump out the contents of not one, but EVERY MACHINE onto the floor. Both washers and dryers. Totally cool.

Maybe the best part, though, was the fact that you saw fit to, I don't know, mix all of that laundry together, in several nice big wet piles across the room (remember, wet laundry + dry laundry = more wet laundry). If there's one thing I look forward to, it's picking through other people's wet laundry to try and fine bits and pieces of my own. And I'm sure they appreciate it too.

So if anyone happens to find one of my shirts, a pair of boxers, and maybe a few stray socks within their own clothes, please, PLEASE don't thank me. Thank the asshole who decided it was a good idea to send a tornado spiralling through the basement.
