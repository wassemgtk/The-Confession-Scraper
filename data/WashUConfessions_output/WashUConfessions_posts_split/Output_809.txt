Dear My Little Brothers Carpool,
My Mom is a widowed working single mom, making my little brother an orphan. You're a stay at home mom with a CEO husband. You really can't be bothered to drive 5 minutes out of your way to pick up A FUCKING ORPHAN? Like my Mom needs to pick YOUR SON up from your house when she drives to school but you can't be bothered to do the same?

You're fucked up and I hope your husband drops dead so you can know what it's like to have people with nothing better to do refuse to help you.
