I confess that I sometimes feel a bit disappointed in people around me. I am a really competitive / ambitious person, and early on I realized that people don't really like that so I always tried to hide my competitive side. It is a bit disappointing to me that I cannot show the true me to my friends / have to hide it / nobody really understands my ambition.

Good thing is that now I gradually became more comfortable with the tiger within me and sometimes I show it to scare people :)
