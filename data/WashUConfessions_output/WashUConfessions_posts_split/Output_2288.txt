I know I'm not as smart as a majority of my peers here. Friends tell me I'm much smarter than I think I am but the fact of the matter is that I'm not. I'm already done stewing over it, I had that existential crisis winter break of freshman year. I am not as smart as my friends and am going to have to try a bit harder, and even then might not get the same results. I have to come to grips with that, I have accepted it, and compartmentalized it. What I cannot handle and what I confess it this: I hate what this school has made me: a poser. I hate that I have to act smart in order to fit in here. I hate that I have to act like I know what I'm talking about when the truth is I have the tiniest idea. I hate the whole try hard atmosphere and I hate the obsession with grades and people's incessant whining. Sorry for the rant but this has been cooking for a while, just like my nerves. Y'all are gonna give me a fucking ulcer. I'm over this, man.
