It annoys me that at this school people only talk about African Americans as a minority. What about Jews (they only make up about 2% of this country) or Arab and Muslim Americans who face daily hostility and sometimes terrorism of their own. I have rarely even seen a latino student on our campus. There are so many minorities out there and I just cant comprehend why we can only seem to consider one group.
