I've seen responses to all of the depression posts to the effect of "Why are all of you so sad? Life's actually pretty all right." I've heard close friends of mine make similar remarks with regard to the confessions page in general. So to all of you out there who don't understand what depression is actually like, and who want to understand how it feels and why it's so difficult to escape, I think this comic is one of the best descriptions. I'm hoping this will promote a little more understanding.
And if you're going through it now and haven't seen this, read it too, if only to know you really aren't alone, and that it's possible to make it out alive. It helps a little.
