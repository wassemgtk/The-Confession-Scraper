Alcohol is the best thing that ever happened to my social life. I used to be so reserved before I was a freshman and now I get such a high from meeting tons of new drunk people and flirting with girls. I'm now a Junior and people from home have complimented me on how much more fun I am to talk to than I was before. Obviously people can be and have fun without partying but there's just a little edge that comes with it that I just can't get enough of.
