I confess that I just lost all respect I had for a professor in my program. I had worked closely with this prof this semester. They seemed pleased with my work and I gained a lot of respect for them, in turn. It's all gone after reading an email to a shared colleague.  The email boiled down to statements of how promising the colleague is compared to others in their group (me) and how others in their group have "chosen their life style". I'm transgender. Apparently it's something I chose to be. I'm also not promising. I just wish the professor would have been bold enough to say these things to me, instead of in an e-mail to my colleague. Just because you're respected in your field doesn't mean that you have class.
