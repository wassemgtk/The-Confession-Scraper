I am all for fighting for change when it comes to sexual assault. When I heard the green dot training was going down, I was happy that something is being done; however, I did have a question about it: one statistic said that 63.5% of undergrads has witnessed a drunk person headed for a sexual encounter and that ~74.9% of students did nothing. While I am not trying to make a value judgement, what is the goal? For students to never have a sexual encounter with someone else when drunk because they technically can't give consent, or for someone to make sure they are fine before they hook up with someone? Is it inherently bad for someone to have a drunken hookup or are we all trying to fight for those survivors who obviously couldn't give consent? Any clarification would be greatly appreciated!
