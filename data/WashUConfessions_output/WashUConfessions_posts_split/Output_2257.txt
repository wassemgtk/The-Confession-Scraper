I see a frequent commenter on Facebook who goes to Washu who promotes equality, progress, and will bash anyone for anything that can, even unintentionally, resemble a thought against any type of equality. I know for a fact you have committed a second degree rape against someone on campus...and you were never sentenced. The person did not charge you because of internal reasons, but you act like nothing happened. It sickens me whenever I see those types of comments form you after what you have done and, for the sake of the victim, can not call you out.
