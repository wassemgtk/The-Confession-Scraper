I'm just confused as to what Wash u expects of me. What my mom and dad expect of me. My extended family. There's just so much to live up to. I don't want to let generations of my family down. I don't want all my parent's money to go down the drain paying for their loser kid who doesn't accomplish anything. How do I know what's the right path for me? There's so much I want to do but I just can't seem to find the right fit. How am I supposed to pick a major when I'm not even good enough for this school? I'm just worried that I'm never going to do anything important with my life. That my mom and dad won't even want to look at me because they know I'm a failure. I need their approval and support. I just want to make them happy and be proud of me. But I don't know how to do that.
