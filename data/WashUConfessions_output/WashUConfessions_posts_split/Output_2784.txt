This is my fifth year at WashU. I had enough good friends to do okay for my first four years, despite the fact that I (like everyone else) have some emotional issues. But because I had such good friends, I never knew how bad it was. I'm so bipolar I can be on top of the world one second and seconds from attempting suicide the next. I've turned to alcohol to deal with it, and it's working for now: it decreases the extreme range of the mood swings. But without any friends I really don't know how much longer I can go on. And to make matters worse, due to some recent experiences I don't even feel I can trust my friends anymore. I think I need help, but like my friends I don't believe in professionals. Help?
