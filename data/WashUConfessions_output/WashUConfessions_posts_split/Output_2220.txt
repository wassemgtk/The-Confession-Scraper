I hate it when people judge me for only taking 12 credit hours this semester. They always scoff when they hear it, or call me a slacker, or tell me that my life is so easy and I have to reason to complain about school. The reason why I am taking a light load is because I had lots of mental health problems this summer, and I didn't want to overwhelm myself with classes that might push me back over the edge. On top of it all, I have to go to 3 and a half hours of therapy each week, plus 2 hours total drive time which is another time stressor in my schedule. By not taking a ton of credits  I made the right choice for my health and people should not judge something that they don't know the reasons behind. Why do people even brag about taking huge course loads in the first place? Congratulations on never getting enough sleep and always being stressed out! If that's something you're proud of, then fine, but don't try to make me feel guilty or feel like a slacker for taking care of myself and my health.
