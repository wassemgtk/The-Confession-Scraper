I have to get something off my chest that I've been thinking about for a long time now. 

Horses are too big like wtf they're like 8 feet tall, they should be like the size of goats. They can and will kill a man, which, granted, isn't saying much because many things can kill a man, including a dedicated enough goose, but still. Also, horses are jacked af, have you ever really looked at a horse, because they have large rippling muscles that exude bloodlust.

Horses want to destroy me. Horses have no empathy and I am afraid. 

I don't care if I get hate for this, it needs to be said. Horses are too damn big.
