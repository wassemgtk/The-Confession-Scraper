I feel like I've gotten worse at college each semester I've been here. I've gone from making Dean's List, being widely involved, and happy to barely maintaining a 3.0 and seldom going out or participating in student activities. I wonder what grad schools will think of this rampant decline, but I'm just not at all happy here anymore, and I'm afraid of the effect this might have on my future.
