If I hear one more person spouting off the fact that "women only make 77 cents for every dollar a man makes" as an argument for why society is so sexist, I might have to stab myself. If you actually look into the statistic it doesn't mean that a man makes more than a woman if they're in the same job. It means that on average across the US men tend to take more dangerous, higher paying jobs, and work more hours. The statistic is comparing average income across the nation, not individual cases. If it were true that women were only paid 77 cents on the dollar for the same work, every company would fire all the men, and hire women because it would be cheaper.
