I'm a sophomore who just got a 1.6 semester GPA. I had a decent but not incredible GPA before that, but now it's pretty terrible. I feel like so many people tell me not to worry about my GPA or that stuff like that won't matter in the long run, but I can't help but feel like not only have I wasted a ton of my parents' money, but also have such smaller chances at landing a relevant internship this summer, which is pretty important in getting a job down the road in my field. I know that there's always more time to work hard and raise my grades, but I just feel like such a fuck-up who's thrown his whole future away.
