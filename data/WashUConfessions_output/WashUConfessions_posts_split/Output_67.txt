In the last year my mom has placed her new high-status job over family, even missing my little brother's birthday dinner. She is seriously struggling to balance work and family and I feel anti-feminist when I try to talk to her about it. But I hated trying to explain to a 12 year old why his mom was too busy to make it home for dinner.
