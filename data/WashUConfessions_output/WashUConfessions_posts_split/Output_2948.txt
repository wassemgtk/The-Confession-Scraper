I was drugged and raped in high school and now I'm a little wary of alcohol/drugs and of guys. I don't really party or date because it takes me back to that night. But I feel like people judge me because I don't drink and am not interested in dating or even hooking up. I just want people to understand why I choose to avoid those things.
