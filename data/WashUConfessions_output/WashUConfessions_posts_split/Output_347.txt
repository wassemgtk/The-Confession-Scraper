Sometimes when I'm in a conversation, I find people just start saying random things, or when the conversation comes to an end, they'll  repeat something they said earlier to try and revive it. It's like they're afraid of silence, like not saying anything when you're with another person is some stigma. But silence isn't a bad thing. It gives you a chance to think of something meaningful to say, and it's much more awkward trying to force a conversation than it is to be silent for a while.
