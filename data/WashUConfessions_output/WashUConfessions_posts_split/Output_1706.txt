Thursday night, I was quietly writing a paper in a study room on the second floor of Olin. My friend had just left to grab some food. A custodial staff member was making his rounds through the second floor, and entered the room I was in. I looked up, startled, and he assured me that he would be right on his way. The man noticed my binders sprawled over the desk, and casually asked me what I was studying.

“Oh, business,” I said. “Have a paper due tomorrow.”

The man then smiled, “You know, I just finished my classes!”

“Really?” I asked, caught somewhat off guard. “What in?”

“You see, I’m certified,” he beamed, and proceeded to pull a card out of his wallet.

Surprised, I took the card from the man. “Certified notary” it read. He proudly told me how he was getting on his feet, and even showed me his home office that he had just put together.
It took me a few moments  to think of anything to say other than "Oh cool" or "Wow, congratulations", but I managed to realize, “Oh yeah, you’re certified to sign off on important documents!”

The man seemed so incredibly excited, it actually made me a little sad inside. Here he was, putting in odd hours at the school at night, and was doing his best to get himself on his feet. As much as my interaction with him had already made my day, I told him that I really needed to get back to my paper. He understood, and started to walk out the door. Just before he left, he turned around.

“You know, one day, I just want to leave all this fucking shit behind, you know? Like roll this bin downstairs, and walk out, and never come back.”

Again at a loss for words, all I could manage was a gentle look of reassurance.

“God bless,” I offered, as he walked away.

Never before, I don’t think, had I truly understood what it meant to have been given such an opportunity to attend Washington University in St. Louis.

Thanks.
