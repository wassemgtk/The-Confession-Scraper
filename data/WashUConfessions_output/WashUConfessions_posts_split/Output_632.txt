ally try to stay away from press, but Alex Siegman had a good heart for wanting to write this article about mental health. For those who aren't familiar, Alex had also recently written the viral article on Adjunct Professors.

It takes bravery to write an honest and personal article addressing mental health on a college campus like Wash U's, and he did a fantastic job. I think it will really resonate with a lot of people.

And Alex, thanks for the journalistic integrity. Much respect for you.
