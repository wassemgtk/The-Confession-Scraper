To the person who I could hear purging in the bathroom tonight: I was conflicted and didn't know what to think/do/say, so I did and said nothing. It probably wasn't my place, anyhow. I thought a lot though. When it was me, I didn't want sympathy or pity or weird looks or offers of "help" or people saying they "understood" or judgment or much of anything that someone could "give" me, really. Everyone's experience is different of course, and I can't presume to know what, if anything, is best to say, so I'll just say this: I love you. But if that's too weird/personal, then maybe read it in the passive (sorry English teachers everywhere): You are loved.
