I've lost a lot of weight and I'm proud of myself for it, but now I'm scared because I'm still not happy with how my body looks and I can't stop the cycle of starve/binge/starve because it's the only thing that gets me results. I refuse to stop losing weight but I don't know how to be more sustainable about it.
