I honestly think I need adderall. Or Prozac. I can't bring myself to focus on work. I'm always thinking about family health troubles I'm having, and if I can get my mind off of that then I just want to spend my time destressing on Facebook. I have a paper due now in an hour that I haven't started and all day I've been avoiding the stress of writing it by doing nothing. It's a serious mental barricade and I don't know how else to get better.
