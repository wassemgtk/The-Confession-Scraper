I confess that I am tired.

I am tired of all this hate. Everywhere I turn, it seems someone is lashing out at another for their views, calling them "dumb" or "misguided" or "idiotic." Everywhere I turn, it seems someone is touting off how another view is evil or wrong. In the name of "love" for mankind, they spread hate.

I am tired of all this hypocrisy. Here we stand, watching as people march around, crying out against inequality. Here we stand, letting some of these same people ensure that we can never be equal, because they only deepen the divisions among us. In the name of tolerance, they bitterly spread intolerance.

I am tired of all this division. We divvy ourselves up by our race, by our political views. We make ourselves vulnerable to the predators who thrive in these splits, who find power and fame and fortune in our refusal to set aside our differences, and who struggle to make sure that we will never overcome our barriers and therefore destroy their "valiant" success in the fight for "social equality."

I am tired of the double standards. I am tired of the false dichotomies. I am tired of the immense, overwhelming sense of pride that some people feel the need to not only exercise but also to shove down our throats as they boast in their alleged superiority, explaining in such elaborate and venom-soaked detail why they are right and you are wrong.

We stand as some of the brightest, most accomplished, most privileged people in all of history. We--not just here at Wash U but all over the USA--are the world's greatest chance to make tomorrow better. But we can not, we will not, because we are stuck squabbling with each other.

 I don't care if you're black or white or any other race. I don't care if you're a Democrat or a Republican. I don't care if you're an atheist or a Christian or a Muslim or a Jew. All I care about is whether you're going to be the problem or the solution. And if your actions support the division, and hatred, and hypocrisy, and so many other problems that run rampant in this country, then you are part of the problem.

Yeah, this is offensive. It's time we get offended. Yeah, this is uncomfortable. It's time we get uncomfortable. If we can't change, then we will never be able to cause real change. We've spent decades chasing the wrong people, the wrong problems because we cannot overcome our problems. And I am tired of it. I'm tired of it all. I'm ready for change.
