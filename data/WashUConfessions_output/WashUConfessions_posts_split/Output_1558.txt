Most people and the objective side of me would say that I'm too young to be worried about this, but it has become a genuine concern of mine. I have yet to find someone who I genuinely like and connect with on all levels which include but are not limited to intellectually, emotionally, artistically, and physically. It's really made me question if I ever will.

When there's a lull in my hectic schedule, the thought kind of eats at me. It'd be nice to have someone to go on dates, experience and share moments in life, go on hikes and jogs through the park, try new foods, have late night talks, and cuddle with. Having someone understand and know who you are on an intimate level, not necessarily physical, is a beautiful thing, and I feel like I'm missing out on that aspect of life.

I've been on my fair share of dates and tried to make it work but to no avail. You'd think after being in a graduating class of 730 people in high school and being away at college and in grad school for going on 5 years now I would've met at least one person...

I refuse to be a part of an arranged marriage or resort to eHarmony. Funny how I'm worried about this when I'm drowning in exams, quizzes, and patient cases. I've obviously prioritized my worries. Am I the only one feeling this way???

Constructive suggestions on what I can do to change this state I'm in are welcome! Help, please...someone...anyone...
