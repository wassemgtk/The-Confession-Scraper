I've always been bullied by my weight, but no one ever sympathizes. I've been told I look like an Auschwitz victim, been told I need to eat more, been told "dude, you're skinny as shit."  My family always tries to make me eat way past being full because they want me to change my weight, despite my already eating more than them.
It's great that we have a movement towards body acceptance, but why does that always have to come with skinny-shaming?  So many songs dismiss "skinny bitches" as fake and snide - how is that body positive?
Why is it okay for people to make fun of my weight?  Insult me for it?  Try and change me?
