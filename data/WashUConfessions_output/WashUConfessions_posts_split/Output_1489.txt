Last semester, out of fear, I skipped meetings of a program that is extremely important to me because of a falling out with two people. I was anxious about what others in the program would think of me. At the beginning of this semester, I reluctantly went to a retreat for the program and was welcomed back by everyone with open arms and love, absolutely no questions asked. This experience is why I'm so proud and lucky to be a student at the caring community that is WashU!
