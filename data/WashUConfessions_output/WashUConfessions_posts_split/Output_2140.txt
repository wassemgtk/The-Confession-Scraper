I confess that I used to go to frat parties (God knows why, probably too drunk) and would tell my friends I was leaving because I "wasn't feeling it." Oh no. It was because I was so afraid of potential interaction. I was literally scared shitless of dealing with people because I'm a pussy. Good game, fear. You won.
