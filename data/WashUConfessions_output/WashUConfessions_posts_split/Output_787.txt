I'm so stressed. For the past two years, my scholarships and financial aid have been enough for me to not have to pay a dime to come to WashU--which was the condition that my parents gave me for being allowed to go to college in the first place. This year, my dad got a raise, so my financial aid went down and now I have to pay a little. It's not a lot, only like $4000 a semester (this is after I begged them for more aid) but I can't ask my parents for money. I have enough money saved to pay for this semester, but I was hoping that my savings would be used to apply to medical schools next year. 

I have a feeling that everything will turn out ok eventually, but tonight I'm just so tired of being reminded that wanting to be a doctor is such an unrealistic goal for me. I'm in the process of studying for the MCAT, and somedays I can almost feel my white coat, while others, like today, make me lose all motivation.
