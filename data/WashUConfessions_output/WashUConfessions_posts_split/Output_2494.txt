People keep telling me I'm beautiful but all I see when I look in the mirror is a big forehead, jiggly thighs and a thick waist. I had a pastry today and all I can think about is how much exercise I have to do before the calories are gone, gone, gone. I look at all my friends eat whatever they want and still be skinny and I'm so envious it hurts. I go to bed hungry more often than not but I always end up binging a few days later. I'm scared that I'm developing an eating disorder, but even more than that I'm scared that I like the clean, empty feeling of being hungry. I like seeing the scale go down and my waist get smaller. I know I should get help but I don't want to stop losing, not when I have so much left
