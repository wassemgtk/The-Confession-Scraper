There is no such thing as a rape culture, only bad statistics and dishonest journalism. People fall victims of rape, but they don't need the fantasy of a mythical rape culture to validate their experience. I was threatened with a false sexual assault accusation freshmen year. You can't imagine the fear unless you've experienced it yourself, that there are people so devious and psychopathic as to threaten you with lies about rape. She didn't do it at the end. Thank god. But now I can feel my blood boiling whenever I hear people preaching about the 1 in 5 bs. Poisonous, poisonous lies..
