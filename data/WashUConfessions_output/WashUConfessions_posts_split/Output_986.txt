You. The person reading this. (Even the admin, you delightful person.)

Think of a person who has meant something to you. A close friend. Sibling. Mentor. Honestly the first person who pops into your head who's done something worth a damn to you.

Let them know what they mean to you and what you think of them. Clearly and explicitly, in a letter or over the phone or email or even a cleverly chosen series of Snapchats.

Because one of my close friends here just did that, and I am sitting here still thinking about it and bawling my eyes out. I don't think of myself as an emotional guy. But that kindness meant so much more to me than I thought it would. And that person that you just thought of, who means something to you? That person deserves that feeling too.

Congrats Class of 2015.
