I'm a 21 year old virgin and as a guy it's kinda starting to get to me that I've never even had a relationship.  I feel like I'm a nice, interesting guy who is relatively decent looking (I don't think i'm Unattractive).  I can't seem to meet women though.  I'm not in a frat and I feel like that severely affects my dating/hooking up life.  This sucks.
