I hate my parents. I really do. I put so much effort in school and this semester I've gotten my best grades yet, my lowest being a B, but I'm not good enough for them apparently, and instead I get yelled at for being involved in extracurriculars when I should be focused more on work, even though extracurriculars are what keep me sane and happy. I hate winter break, and I hate coming home.
