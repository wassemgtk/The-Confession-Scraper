I'm sorry for this but you're a bitch for not posting my fraternity/sorority post even though you can post other controversial offensive stuff like the Michael brown shooting. Fuck you. Bitch. Two faced bitch, honesty my ass. Go fuck yourself.

=========================================
I didn't put your post through because it wasn't really a confession and was actually offensive, but if your post meant so much to you that you would curse me out, I'll do it for you this one time.

Also because I don't think people will take you seriously anyway given that you just anonymously threw a temper tantrum, instead of having the guts to send this page a direct message through Facebook.

(I deleted the original post and removed the links from the submission after some people asked me to. They were pictures of a person's rankings of the fraternities and sororities on campus.)
