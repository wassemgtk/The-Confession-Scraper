Sometimes, I get really jealous when I see people studying hard. I don't know where they find the motivation to do so. Getting out of bed for the day is a daily struggle for me, so I feel really inadequate when everyone else seems to be working so hard. I used to be able to work hard, but now I can't. And I feel really guilty, which makes it even harder to leave bed.
