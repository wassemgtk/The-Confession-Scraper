Reading through all the submissions about depression at WUSTL, I feel truly saddened. Coming from someone who has achieved society-defined "success" at Wash U (GPA > 3.9, 99th percentile MCAT, and exec positions in many clubs), I believe the mental struggle exists at some degree  for most Wash U students. Some people may think that because they  have done well, this issue is only for those who have "underperformed" at Wash U.

I am here to say that is NOT TRUE. I, along with many friends who also did well in classes, felt excessive amounts of pressure to keep up our grades, do well on every exam, and get into everything we applied for. I have seen, on more than one occasion, friends who have had nervous breakdowns here. Seeing these things, we have to ask, "at what cost do we obtain our education and is it worth it?"

People often tell me that I am "intelligent," but I confess that I walk into class almost every day scared that I won't live up to people's expectations of me. With every exam, paper, and project, I wonder if I will still be deemed "smart." I do not believe I am any better than any other person in any of my classes. With that said, what even is intelligence? I believe intelligence can exist outside of just academic realms. Why does society and Wash U place such an emphasis on being academically intelligent? I believe that the university needs to do a better job addressing the academic pressure students are under and to have more honest discussions about mental health issues.

Sincerely,
A Stressed Senior
