I confess that break has been hell for me. In the last 2 weeks, my mom has been diagnosed with a chronic life-threatening illness, my sister stole someone's car in a drug-induced rage and then was subsequently put in a "home," my boyfriend and I have done nothing but fight, I've been through a series of financial setbacks, my old friends haven't approached me, and my WashU friends and I have not talked once. I can't wait to get back to school where the overwhelming load of homework will distract me from the tragedy that is my home life.
