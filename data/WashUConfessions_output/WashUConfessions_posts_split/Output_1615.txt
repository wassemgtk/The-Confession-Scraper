Let me start by saying this: Washu dining is normally very efficient and tasty. However, there is a fallacy in the system; a type of minimism ideology that only seems to be applied to the size of the cereal bowls and chili containers. I hope to find the answer to the most burning question I can think of: Why are they so small? WHY?! My stomach is left wanting more after one cereal bowl than I've ever wanted in my 19 years of existence. If only my meal plan could fund the endless chili pots and cereal bowls my appetite yearns for. Please bd, make the bowls bigger. Stop the madness. Introduce a bottomless chili wednesday perhaps? I don't know, but do something. Empty stomachs have caused many populations to do horrible things in the past. I.e. Communism. I sincerely hope BD and the WashU dining elite do not hope such a thing to occur on our campus. That is all.
