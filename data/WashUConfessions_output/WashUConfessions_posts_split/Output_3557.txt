When I was studying abroad in China, I was scared to poop in their version of a toilet aka a hole in the ground. So during the 4-5 weeks I was there, I only pooped 4 times. When I came back to the Amurrrrrica I took the biggest, fattest shit in the history of human kind. It was easily 2 feet long and a solid 6 inches in diameter. It ripped my asshole apart...on the flip side, carrying so many pounds of shit in my intestines made me lose a lot of weight! #newdietplan
