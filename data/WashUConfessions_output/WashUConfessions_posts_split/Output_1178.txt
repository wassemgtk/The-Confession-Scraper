After reading confession #2631, I feel like I've been lied to. I knew WashU places a lot of emphasis in making itself look good (literally and metaphorically), but I can't help but feel betrayed to the point where I almost ripped up my diploma. I ultimately didn't mainly because I didn't want to pay the registrar (and thus the school) even another cent to have the $200k piece of paper re-printed.
