Saw the other post about femdom and decided to submit (see what I did there ;D ) too. I confess that I'm definitely into femdom and wish there was a more active community for it on campus.

Shoutout to the Alternative Lifestyle Association... can y'all set up some sort of Femdom discussion group or something? Really not sure how to contact you.
