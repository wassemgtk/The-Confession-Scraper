As a black student myself, I am honestly ashamed of and embarrased by some of my presumptuous and pretentious black peers. Really, we are no different but a lot of us try to make ourselves seem like we're special by overreacting to every little criticism and throwing a fit whenever something isn't 100% politically correct. When we overreact to prejudice, we are simply guilty of prejudice ourselves. And people definitely notice, but most stay silent because we play the black card way too often and they're afraid of expressing their criticisms. But they still hate us- I do too.
To the community: I apologize for all the BS that you get from "black activists". I apologize for the black people who have a stick up their ass and construe all criticism against black people as "racism".
