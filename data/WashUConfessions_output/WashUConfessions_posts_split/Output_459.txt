A girl on tinder asked me how tall I was. I replied, asking her how heavy she was. She said why does her size matter, so I asked her why does my height matter. Turns out it didn't, lol I'm tall af and she's hot af. But double standards tho... Like you may be all about that bass but you want me not to care, but if I'm 5' something then it's all treble??
