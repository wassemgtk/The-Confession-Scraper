I confess that I agree with posts like #1529, #1526, and some of the other controversial/unpopular posts on here, but I'm too afraid to "like" them. Honestly I'm afraid of the judgmental backlash, and I have several friends who I know would never speak to me again if I did. Anyway, it's still good to know that some people at Wash U still have some common sense, even if they can't express it publicly.
