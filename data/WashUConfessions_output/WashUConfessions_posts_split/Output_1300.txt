Today I realized how easy it is to take our Wash U experience for granted. Yes, it's hard. Yes, it's a lot of work. Yes, we lose sleep. But I love it. I fought for my right to be here. My right to learn, grow, achieve. And I love our school. Of course it is by no means perfect-- but no institution is. I guess what I'm trying to say is that I feel so lucky to attend Wash U, and I'm pretty damn proud of my school and the accomplishments it's allowed me to achieve.
