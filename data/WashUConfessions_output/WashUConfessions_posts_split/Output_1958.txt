I am too quick to judge.

I have seen the complaints here— that we feminists are too judgmental, that we proclaiming "Black Lives Matter" are giving people panic attacks, that we liberals are not hearing your calls for dialogue— and I feel sad.

I cannot apologize for those actions. Those are not my actions. But I can apologize for every time I've snapped, raised my voice in an argument, or dismissed someone for their beliefs.

There are reasons; there are vindicating reasons for my nonconstructive actions, and it is important you recognize where I'm fighting from when we disagree— the stakes of an argument about police brutality are much higher for the one being brutalized than the one thinking it's ok, and it's exhausting to constantly fight that battle whether I win or lose. It's hard to be dismissed just because I call myself a "feminist" or "liberal" or whatever. Sometimes I just need to vent.

But I don't go around trying to hurt others, and if I end up hurting someone I try to apologize. Usually that happens in person, but I'm apologizing here for a reason:

I see people going around with MY labels and choosing to hurt other people. I see people coopting the power of great names and years of struggle to do evil. I see abusers cowering behind the label of feminism, cruel hands gloved in the kindness of religion, rapists and murderers deciding they are "men's rights activists."

I want to make it clear:

No label can make you a good person.

There are bad people in this world and it doesn't matter what they call themselves. Feminists who abuse are abusers. Priests who rape are rapists. MRAs who murder are murderers.

This is not a false equivalency. I am not saying MRAs and feminists do evil in equal amounts. I do not believe that is true— I believe MRAs have a lot more listening to do than feminists, and should probably stop suggesting we beat up women.

But that does not mean I should be content with being a feminist.
It does not mean I should be content with my label.

Regardless of who you are, call out shitty people.

Because I know I've been one, plenty of times.

And it would be nice to know, independent of spectrum and affiliation, we are gonna make sure no one gets to be a shitty person for long.

I cannot say that "this is not what feminists believe" because those women identify as feminists and they clearly believe in whatever abuse they propagate.

I wanted to emphasize that there are those among us who condemn violence and would be first in line to chew out those abusers, and I think most feminists would fight to join the line as well.

I cannot provide you with proof that's true, but I can provide you with resources.

AARDVARC should be a good starting point if you are seeking help, and any page on domestic violence against women should be able to refer you to a counterpart against men.

Fuck abusers.
