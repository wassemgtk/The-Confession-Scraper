I cut myself twice this year. I stopped. The scar reminds me every day that if I won't put up with my own shit anymore, I won't put up with anyone else's, either. And I will do everything I can to make sure the people around me don't have to feel like I did. Some people get tattoos to commemorate this kind of thing. At least I saved myself a few bucks, right?
