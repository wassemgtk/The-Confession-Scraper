As a student with a parent in WashU's administration, I've personally had my facebook page censored by WashU before.  Comments/statuses negative toward the administration deleted, one time even logged in to find "I" had made a bunch of pro-admin comments on the Save Boo Boo page last school year (I guess I left my page up at home).  Mom has literally called me for my facebook password before so she could go in and do it herself when I wasn't near a computer, threatening with sanctions at home if I didn't comply (I did).  Some of the times she decided to herself, other times her co workers and higher-ups have asked her to because they knew she could make me.
