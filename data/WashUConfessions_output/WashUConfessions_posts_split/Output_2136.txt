I confess that I just found out the girl I've been dating for a little while now has been doing the same thing with multiple other guys while feigning exclusivity, and she still hasn't come clean.  If she'd told me at the start, maybe we could've worked something out, but now I just want her gone.  I don't appreciate being manipulated and used, and I have self-respect.  I just wish people would be honest and up-front, at least that way I don't lose all my dignity...
