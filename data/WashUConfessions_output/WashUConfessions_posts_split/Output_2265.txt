As an hispanic woman I was really offended when I was told the other day that since I'm latino (and therefore a minority) that I should get my own  "safe zone" on campus.

Let me make this clear, just because my skin color may be a shade different than yours does not mean I need help standing up for myself. I can take care of myself. I don't need a buffer or a special sign or any other kind of hand out to protect me from the world. My ethnicity doesn't make me a handicap. Offering me a "safety zone" based on my ethnicity is like giving me training wheels for life. It is the most ultimate form of racism; and I stand by this so fervently that I will comment and attach my name to it if this gets posted.
