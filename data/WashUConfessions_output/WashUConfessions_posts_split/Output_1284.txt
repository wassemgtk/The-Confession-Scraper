When is enough, well, just that, enough? At what point is something no longer worth it despite all of the time, effort, and emotional investment you've put into it.

I have never given into a serious relationship before, I've always been guarded  and in some ways rightfully so. Many people are able to wear their hearts on their sleeves as the saying goes, but given the things I've seen and personally been through, it no longer comes easily to me, it's unnatural. The following may sound elementary to you all, but like I said, I've never been in a serious relationship before and am completely out of my element.

I started seriously dating someone who has been a close friend of mine for the past 3 years now and given into the emotional intimacy of it all. I've fought off this very moment in all of my relationships as I don't think I could take on the downfall of it on top of everything else in my life. Recently though, I've found that I'm questioning this decision. I've seen the conversations between him and this person he calls "only a friend" "who's like an older sister to [him]." Funny thing is, our friendship started in a similar way, in that I was in a year above his and just called us friends.

I've seen how she can be inappropriately flirtatious with him, to my face no less. She's made comments about me that I wouldn't think of making about a friend's significant other. I'd like to believe I'm a decently perceptive person, and when I feel like there's something suspicious going on, there most likely is something to be suspicious of. To make matters worse, he asks her about attending events that he hasn't even brought up to me.

If it was anyone else, I would've brought this issue up and ended the relationship the moment I found out about these things, these are things I don't tolerate. But with him, it's different because he was the first friend I became close with in a place I felt so isolated and alone in, he stuck it out with me and made being here bearable. But at what point is enough enough? I don't want this relationship to ruin my outlook on any future, prospective, meaningful relationships I may have if it isn't worth it from the start.
