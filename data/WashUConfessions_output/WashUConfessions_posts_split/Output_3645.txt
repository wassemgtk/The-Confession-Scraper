Wash U students are, by and large, much better people than what can be expected after reading these posts. I only hope that no students considering applying to this university stumble across this page and get the wrong idea. In my years as a proud member of this community, I have witnessed countless instances of students performing good deeds, helping each other to succeed, demonstrating welcoming/accepting behavior, and just generally being good, decent, honest people. So please stop posting messages that make the entire world think otherwise.
