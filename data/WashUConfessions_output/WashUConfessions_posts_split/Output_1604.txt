I am the one of people behind the #ClaimYourBigotry/YikYak campaign. Iâ€™d like to preface this by saying no student group, ESPECIALLY NOT the Association of Black Students and Black Anthology, had anything to do with the YikYak Flyering today. It was a group of us who were upset with the lack of acknowledgment of the visible, verbal and blatant racism on this campus. We were extremely offended by these yaks that address Ferguson, BA and other recent events. Our intention was not to cause anxiety but you should feel uncomfortable about these posts because they reflect the thoughts and the feelings of your peers. We have been uncomfortable since we stepped through the Brookings Arch. You are using your privilege of anonymity to intentionally hurt other specific people.

THIS IS NOT A REPRESENTATION OF THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS OF THE ENTIRE BLACK COMMUNITY. We are one section of it. This is our opinion. We are hurt and this is our expression. Just as the people that posted those yaks wanted their freedom of expression this is ours. We are not sorry.
