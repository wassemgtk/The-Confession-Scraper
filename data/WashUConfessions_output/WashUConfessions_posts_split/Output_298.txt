this past week was honestly the first time where i really felt happy at wash u. i truly felt at home due to a sense of belonging from close friends, the teams I'm in and the general community. As a sophomore, I am ecstatic that this moment finally came, and am so eager to enjoy the rest of my time at wash u. For those of you who are/were struggling to acclimate, realize that it always takes time to adjust, and for everyone it's a different amount. You DO NOT have to be in love instantly with a university in order to gain a satisfying, enriching experience. It will come eventually, just give it time. :]
