I was pretty receptive to this whole Mike Brown thing until protesters started shouting "fuck the police" and everybody decided to defend Vonderrick Myers after he fired on an officer (sorry, you can't shoot bullets with a sandwich). No wonder cops are afraid of black communities, I don't even blame them anymore. If people are serious about improving relationships between black communities and white police officers, maybe they should recognize the police killed in the line of duty as an important contributing factor in the conflict instead of rallying hundreds of people to spit on and threaten officers (not to mention loot businesses- these people aren't being productive in resolving the issues of their own neighborhoods). But if I ever put my name on this I would never get a job, so good thing the SJW thought police are there to make sure that I'm quiet about my disagreements instead of being open to candid conversation that might actually change my mind.
