This is kind of difficult for me to say, but I'm starting to think I was emotionally neglected as a child.

My mother grew up in poverty in Asia, under a widowed single mother with 5 children.  They knew families who were literally starving. As a child my mother went through the sudden death of her father, and witnessed in an unrelated event a fatal explosion in which she was showered with human guts.

My parents took me out of school for five years. During this time they encountered serious financial issues. My father was away at work most of the time, but as a man from a traditional family was emotionally absent. My mother worked as well, but always came home extremely upset. She had serious depression and anger issues. She told us we ruined her life, she regretted having children, she wished we were never born, she wanted to abandon us and go back to Asia.

I feel so guilty, I feel like I have to make up for the fact that I was ever born. The only reason I have made it this far is because I have to prove to her that I am worthy of being loved. I love her, I need to make her feel happy.

My 3 other siblings, stuck with only each other for company for most of the day, replicated these behaviors with each other. We have trust issues, we are cold and subtly hostile to everyone, ourselves, definitely each other.

I know of only one person who I could call a friend on campus. I eat lunch with him for an hour once a week.

I know there are lots of people in the world with real problems, but all I know is living hurts so much inside and I feel like I cannot relate to other human beings. I feel like I'm in cage of despair, looking out at everyone else enjoying their lives and each other's lives, loving each other.

I spend most of my day
1. doing homework
2. doing menial office tasks as a student worker
3. regretting the past, fearing the present, dreading the future
4. struggling to sleep at night, to stay awake in the day

Is this real? Am I just making up excuses? Do I have the right to claim that I truly suffer?
