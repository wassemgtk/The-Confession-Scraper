I'm tired of seeing the hard work of student groups ruthlessly criticized on social media. It's baseless, it's hurtful, it's misinformed, it isn't accomplishing anything, it's discounting significant work that students invest in these organizations, and it's  pretty embarrassing to me that our student body can be so petty. It's destructive to positive relations among student groups, putting them against each other when we should be collaborating. Before we trash a group as a whole, can we just remember the people behind that group who your words are targeting the most? Be kind, Wash U.
