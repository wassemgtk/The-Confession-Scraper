So long ago I figured out I was gay, and went through the tumultuous coming out process and got very comfortable with my identity.  These days, however, I'm starting to get more and more attracted to girls, which is a serious problem because I can't just tell people I'm bi all of a sudden- it would betray everything they thought they knew about me.  Plus my family would end up thinking I was confused and flaky.
