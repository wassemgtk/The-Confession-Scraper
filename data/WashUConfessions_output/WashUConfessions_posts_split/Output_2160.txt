In response to the Loft hate, I used to live in UTerrace.  It was small, dark, smelly, and within apartments, there was half an inch or so of space between the walls and the ceiling.  In my time there, there were riots, shootings, carjackings, and countless muggings within a block of where I lived.  There was an armored truck permanently posted on the intersection of Skinker and Delmar.

I still loved it.  I loved living on the Loop, and I loved getting to know its denizens (talk to homeboy with all facial the piercings if he's still around; he's a cool guy).  Living on the Loop provided a thoroughly different experience from what I might have had on campus, and the 11 minute walk to the library - or two minute bike ride - was never overly-burdensome.

For those complaining about the Lofts, I'd invite you to appreciate what you have.  Your accommodation is far superior to what mine was, you have a unique opportunity to experience one of STL's cultural landmarks, and of course, the heightened university presence will, I suspect, lower the level of criminal behavior, making the Loop safer for everyone, not just the WashU community.  It may not be what you wanted, but it's hardly deserving of the animus it seems to have inspired in some of its residents

But more importantly, treasure your transitory time at WashU while you have it, and don't let it be marred by dissatisfaction with your housing.  It will be over far too quickly.
