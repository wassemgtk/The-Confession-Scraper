I would like to say that I am proud of the African American activists on campus that cause an "uproar". Even though they might be more privileged than others DOES NOT mean that they haven't experienced severe forms of racism. As a Black Muslim, I know what it means when you feel like you don't have a voice. It is an honor to go to a university where everyone is not afraid to speak up for not only themselves but for others who dont have the strength to do so themselves.
