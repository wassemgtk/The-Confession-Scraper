I confess that I walked in on another girl purging in the bathroom at Bear's Den. I looked down and saw her bent over the toilet. All I can say is that I was there three years ago and it's not the way to go. But I wonder what she's going through, because when I started hurling at 18 it was because a guy had gotten me drunk one night, took my virginity and then made off with my best friend. It makes me think that eating disorders aren't about the body at all.
