Since I've been here, I've never thought lower of myself and been less happy.
I could've gone to a lower-tier school, been happy, not indebted myself, and not destroyed my chances to get into a good grad school, but I decided to go for a stupid fucking designer degree and 4 years of feeling like a dumb motherfucker.
