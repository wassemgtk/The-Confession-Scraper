After reading a few of the comments regarding the more controversial confessions, I admit that I was a bit worried that the admin of this page would bend to a few people's sensitivity and censor future inflammatory posts. I'm glad that this hasn't happened. Thank you for maintaining free speech and not restricting it to 'speech that I agree with' or 'politically correct mindset.'

So yeah, admin, you're a cool gal/guy. And props to you for getting posts out at like 4 am.

Sincerely,
A WashU Alum
