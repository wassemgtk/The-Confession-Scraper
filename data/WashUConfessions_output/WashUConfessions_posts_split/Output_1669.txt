I confess that I am terrified right now.

I made my mandated post-superbowl status. And two of my fb friends that don't know each other are about to turn the comments into a political debate.

Actually. In general. Don't you just hate when two of your fb friends who don't know each other at all use the comments of your status to get into a heated debate?

Terrifies me.
