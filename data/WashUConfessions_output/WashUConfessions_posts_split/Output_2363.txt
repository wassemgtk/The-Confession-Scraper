I'm really anxious about the teachers in my major talking about me  to each other. I'm anxious about people talking about me in general, but I care about what my teachers think of me more than random other kids in my class. I haven't done exceptionally well in any of my courses, and I never say anything smart or interesting. It's a small enough major I know the professors all know me. But I don't think they like me, or at least I've never given them a reason to.

I admire and respect those professors, and I'd like to be able to be able to keep in contact them after I graduate for help and resources and recommendations. They're also good people who I'd love to get to know better.  But I always get the feeling that they think I'm an airhead who is wasting their time. And I wonder if they'd be wrong. I want to believe I'm smart, but just ill spoken. But maybe that's just because if you talk enough about random stuff eventually you're bound to say something clever by accident.

I whined about a computer program one of my teachers uses, and I remember the look of exasperation in his face and my stomach is in knots. I want to apologize but they've probably already forgotten it's happened.

I'm being paranoid, but I'm so scared that they are all informing each others opinions about me and think I'm not worth their time.
