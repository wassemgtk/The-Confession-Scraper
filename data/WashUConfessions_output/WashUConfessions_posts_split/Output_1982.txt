I confess that I still want more advice on how to deal with my "potential depression". I struggled with a couple of problems this semester including being alone for way too much of time, not being able to get out of bed/home and do my work, etc. I was not in good shape when I met with my dad during Thanksgiving, but I thought he couldn't tell (I didn't really talk to my parents about those issues) so I pretended that nothing happened, but he actually telled. We had a really deep conversation before I went back to school, and I really feel better right now, which is good. Also, this semester is gonna end and I feel I could put all those shitty memories away, put myself together during winter break and start fresh next semester.

So my question is, how could I better adjust myself for school during winter break? I know it sounds rather ridiculous, but I had hoped to start fresh every semester, and haven't succeeded. I have serious procrastination and it's worsening semester after semester, and worst of all, I have less and less friends. I just want to get some advice without forcing myself actually seeking professional help or something. I'm not going back home during winter break, and I'm considering adjusting my sleep schedule, working out and maybe trying to study a little for the materials next semester. And other suggestions?
