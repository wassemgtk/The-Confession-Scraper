It annoys me when I go to the gym and see all these guys with terrible form. I mean, I'm not a big dude so I work with modest weights, but I really don't get it when people pick up weights that are clearly too heavy. Reps are supposed to be isolated, controlled movements, but I see all these guys throwing their backs into it, spazzing out like epilectic dolphins or some shit. What is the point of more weight if they're not good reps? What is the point of MORE REPS if they're NOT GOOD REPS?? That's all...
