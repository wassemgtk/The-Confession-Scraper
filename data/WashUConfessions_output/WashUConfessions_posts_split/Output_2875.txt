I admit this is not a confession, but 2 things to say. i guess i can technically make it a confession by saying "i confess that i believe the following..." 1. i am a dude, and i am a feminist. and if you're not a feminist, you're sexist because feminism refers to the advocacy of women's rights on the grounds of political, social, and economic equality to men. BUT i think that it should not be called feminism, because that makes it sound one-sided and make it seem like it should be a "female only" belief. the term "feminism" also makes it sound like women should be SUPERIOR to men, which is why the word is such a turnoff to a lot of guys. it should be called gender equality, or some non-partison word or phrase 2. for the same reason, the department "women gender and sexuality studies" should just be called "gender and sexuality studies." putting "women" in it excludes men and non-binary people. it's about studying gender, sexuality, gender/sexual identity and formation, etc...it shouldn't be it also discourages men from studying it because the word women it makes it seem "girly"...unfortunate but true. if these kinds of changes are made, men will probably be more willing to be open-minded and interested in talking about / studying these issues. if the "system" works against women, then at least help open up the dialogue to us dudezzzz. peace
