I confess that I feel a little guilty. I just heard that there was a silent protest on Friday for WashU students for Ferguson, and I had no idea about it until this morning (Wednesday). I'll admit that I complained a lot about the other protests, because I was mad that they were interrupting my study time, but I guess I understand why now. If people don't make noise and cause a scene, no one at WashU will care. We all just keep our heads down and mind our own business, and that's no way to create social change: its a way to stay comfortable and keep things how they are. To the protesters: I'm sorry I got so upset, and I'm sorry I made a mean yik yak post about you (even though I got a ton of up votes)
