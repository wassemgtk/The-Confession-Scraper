Let me lay out some of the issues I have with "SJWs" (for lack of a better term). I'm a minority, and it greatly annoys me when people feel as though they have the right to speak for all "oppressed people" as if minorities are some sort of monolithic block. I've never really experienced any kind of discrimination (it's possible that I have and didn't think about it I suppose, but even so I can't say it's really had any tangible impact on my life) and when activists say things like # yesallblackpeople and # yesallwomen (full disclosure, I'm a man), I'm just like...did you really talk to every minority and every woman? I know that there are an abundance of "oppressed group" members who very strongly disagree with you. Why would you presume to speak on my behalf when you don't know anything about me or my experiences?

I certainly don't want to diminish those who have indeed experienced racism or discrimination. I think there's a way to talk about the problems in our society without arbitrarily putting people into categories. I wish SJWs would recognise the diversity of thought and experience that exists among minorities.
