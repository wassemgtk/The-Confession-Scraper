I confess that the fact it feels like WashU curves so many classes pisses me off. I mean honestly, we go to WashU and we're all smart individuals. Professors shouldn't make ridiculous tests where the average is like 50% just so they can always use some kind of BS curve to separate those who got 45% from those who got 55%. How about just making reasonable exams that don't always have to be curved?
