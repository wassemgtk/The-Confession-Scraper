I confess that if you're sick, you should stay away from the library. I get that you're dedicated towards studying but all of you coughing, sneezing, and sniffling make it really distracting, even with my headphones on. Plus you're a lot more likely to get whoever is sitting at the desk sick. Go somewhere where you aren't likely to get someone else sick if you can.
