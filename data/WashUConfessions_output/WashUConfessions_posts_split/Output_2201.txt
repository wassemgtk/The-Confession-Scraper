Working with the University has opened my eyes. Individually everyone is a great person, but something about the institution as a whole makes people act funny. For example don't blame STS for shitty wifi in classes. It's the artsci and engineering deans  that decided to not budget for new routers. B- school dean thought that wifi was important. Also they place those routers strategically. There is a reason that you don't get wifi in crow/louderman until you get out of the room.
