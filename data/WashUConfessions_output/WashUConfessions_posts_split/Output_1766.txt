I'm a freshman and I think I want to at least try rushing.  Most of my friends at Wash U are telling me to avoid Greek Life because it will turn me into an awful person, or take up /all/ of my time, or just generally be a waste of time.  I don't care that they don't like Frats, but I wish they would support what I want to do.

Side-note: I don't party that much, specifically I don't drink.  I just like the idea of meeting new guys and I've heard it can look good when applying to grad schools/applying for jobs.  Is it even worth it for me to rush?
