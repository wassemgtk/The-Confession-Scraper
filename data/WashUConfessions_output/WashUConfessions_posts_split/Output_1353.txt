As Mental Health Awareness Week draws to a close, I wanted to share my secret. I'm a multiple.

Or, I should say, *we* are a multiple (system). For those of you who don't know what that means, it means that functionally, this brain either contains or strongly appears to contain multiple people. This is most commonly seen in dissociative identity disorder (DID), but DID isn't the only way to be multiple. (For those who have seen it, "Sybil" the film/book is grievously sensationalized and should not be taken as a serious source of information on multiplicity.) DID applies to systems who have difficulty functioning because they are multiple; we function just fine and thus fall under the category of "healthy multiplicity".

I know this is hard to swallow, so if you're in doubt about whether this all is real, here's a few articles.

In which a body is sighted or blind depending on which member of the system is at front: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17611729

Other strange effects caused by system members switching (handedness changing, speaking different languages): http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2766827/

Psychological treatment manual stating that systems do not need to integrate (be merged together) in order to be healthy: http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03069885.2011.564606

Another study showing, again, that singularity is not needed in order to be healthy: http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/a0026487

If you're still interested, a "layman's guide" on multiplicity, by a healthy multiple system: http://www.karitas.net/blackbirds/layman/
and a collection of sites by healthy multiples: http://healthymultiplicity.com/

(By the way, please, *please* take anything you read on tumblr about multiplicity with a generous pinch of salt. There's so much misinformation and drama there and to quote a friend, that site's made an utter farce out of everything.)

Some systems start out disordered (DID) and become healthy. We were always functional. I experienced a great deal of abuse I'm still recovering from, which may have caused them to arise in the first place, but we were lucky in that we could communicate and keep our memories. And by working together, we were able to keep down any hostile members who emerged. Now there's seven of us and we work together. We know some DID systems who struggle with being multiple, who struggle with memory loss, malicious members, infighting, and thank our stars every day that things turned out well for us.

The others in this head... Are they fragments? Are they other consciousnesses? Are they spirits? I don't know. But I can say they're more than "just delusions". One took over during a panic attack I had. He held on and spoke to me until I calmed down, at which point he gave control back. Several others come in to help with homework on a regular basis, and when they do, I'll drift away and come back to a page I don't remember writing. In my opinion, they are as equally imaginary and as equally real as I am.

Why am I sharing this if we're a healthy system? Representation. There's not much information out there on healthy multiplicity, and a massive stigma on being multiple. In the public eye, *all* multiples *must* be disordered in some way, *must* contain a serial killer, and can *only* be healthy if they integrate, all of which are very untrue. If we come out, we risk being accused of "faking", of "looking for attention", and at worst we can have our driver's license revoked and forced into "treatment". Like a lot of other systems, we hide and appear to be, to the outer eye, one singular person. Every day, we wonder how many are out there who are like us, especially on this campus.

We are never alone, but sometimes, it gets lonely.
