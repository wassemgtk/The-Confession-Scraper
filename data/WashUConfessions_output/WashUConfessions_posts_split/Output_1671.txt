In the bigger buildings, sometimes the toilets make this weird rumbling noise. Call me crazy, but I have this weird phobia that the noise will get louder and louder until it erupts under me while i'm pooping, shooting upwards in a spiraling shitnado, while I spin around on top with my pants still down. Labsci-- I poop in you reluctantly.
