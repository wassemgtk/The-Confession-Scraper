I didn't rush because I don't have the money to pay sorority dues.  I'm at WashU on a full scholarship due to financial hardship in my family.  I wish I would've rushed, because I would love to be part of a sisterhood and have such a close-knit group of friends.  Is there any way to join a sorority without the dues?
