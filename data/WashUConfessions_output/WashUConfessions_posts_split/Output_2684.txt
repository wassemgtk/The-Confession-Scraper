Everyone I talk to at WashU seems to be depressed or going through some major event in their life or needs mental help. I feel it bringing me down and like I can't talk to anyone without them incessantly complaining about X exam or their truly awful outside situation. I feel horrible for feeling resentful of this, but I wish I could just be around happy people who don't need my help and then refuse to seek any help or listen to any advice I provide. It's frustrating and I'm starting to hate all my friends for being sad.
