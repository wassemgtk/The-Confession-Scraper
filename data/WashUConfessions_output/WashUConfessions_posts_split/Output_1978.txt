I need help. A few months ago my boyfriend of two years wasn't treating me right so I reluctantly let him go. We both moved on really fast. Though I dumped the person I moved on with because they weren't for me either. I've never had so many guys want to go out with me at once. I'm really good at catching men now, because after losing a relationship that was supposed to last the rest of my life, I just don't care about rejection. So I date people. I strike up conversations. I go for it, and it almost always works out. The problem is I can't talk to man without assuming every word coming out of their mouth is a pack of lies. I'm not sure if I'll ever be in love again. I'm scared to be in the same situation I was before when I was being unappreciated and abused. I'm not looking for a relationship. I'm not looking for anything. I love the game; I've gotten really good at it. But I just don't care. I walk away easily. What's wrong with me? I'm not even enthusiastic for the dates that I have with people that are 100x more accomplished than my ex. I just don't care.
