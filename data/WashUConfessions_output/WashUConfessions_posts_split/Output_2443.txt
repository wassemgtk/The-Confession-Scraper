I hate being classified as an "underprivileged minority"
Being poor is only a disadvantage if you let it be. A lack of money has been a wonderful motivator. My economic status came with an open mind, a love for people, and a deep drive for success. Not to mention, my fellow poor people have a depth and level of realness that's hard to find as I climb "the latter".
