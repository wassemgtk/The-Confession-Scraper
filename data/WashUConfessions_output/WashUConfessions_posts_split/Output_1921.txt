more than anything, i just don't want to be lonely anymore. Everything in my life is great, except I'm alone, always. I have friends but I'm always the odd one out, the one forgotten. I don't know how to live like this anymore. My good grades and extracurriculars mean nothing to me when, at the end of the day, I have nobody who genuinely cares.
