I understand the importance of preferred pronouns and changing them daily to fit whatever mood you're in, and I'm glad the greater WashU community is usually cool with non-heteronormative individuals, but I think the pride community is too nice. Students go by "zi/hir" and that's all jolly, but once you graduate and get out to the real world, NO ONE CARES. Most jobs and people won't care if you're zi/zir or they/them. You'll be whatever you were assigned at birth and that's the truth.
