I think Wash U is the most beautiful campus I've ever been to. I love the library especially. The first time I walked in, I thought I was in heaven. All of my favorite authors were there in the traditional fiction area and the shelves that move on the lower levels totally blew my mind. I could easily live there. I actually really enjoy finding a little corner and relaxing there when I have the time. Funny thing though, I go to UMSL. UMSL just isn't as cozy!
