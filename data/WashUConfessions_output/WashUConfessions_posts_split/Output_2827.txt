I'm an international student who gets really tired about how being an ESL becomes our most salient label. Any imperfections even remotely related to the use of language would be concluded as "yes well it's hard for you as an ESL". Come on. Public speaking is hard, transitioning into college is hard, writing an A-paper is hard FOR ALMOST EVERYONE and please stop attributing any problems related to this and other stuff all to "because English is not your native language". And please stop saying "thats an awesome paper for a ESL" and give us differential treatment no matter good or bad. We are admitted on a ln equal basis as everyone else and we should be as capable as everyone else. Such statements, however good intentions it carries, convey a sense of intellectual inferiority which I feel extremely uncomfortable. I attended a high school in a foreign country and my classes were not taught in English but I can write and read and participate in class as well as anyone else can. Please stop judging us on a simple "where are you from"
