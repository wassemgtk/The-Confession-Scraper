I recently read a Facebook post of a friend of a friend on my newsfeed talking about the Israeli-Palestinean conflict and how different student groups on our campus hold different opinions.

I just wanted to say that just because some of us on campus are Persian or Iranian doesn't mean we side with Palestine. If you learn the history of Iran (which WashU should offer a course on) you'd know that many of us left the country in the 1980s because of the radical Republic. I just think it's a little biased for people to either a) assume that all Iranians side with Palestine because we might be Muslim and b) assume that Iranians would oppose legislation on sanctions on Iran.

Just like any other race, we are all individuals with different experiences. Please don't group us all together because we share the same race.

Thanks :)
