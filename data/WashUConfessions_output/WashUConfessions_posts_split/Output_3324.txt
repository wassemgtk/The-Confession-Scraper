As a junior this year, I feel like its become impossible for me to form new close friendships, and at the same time, I'm losing contact with more and more of the people I used to know at this school. Everyone has already formed these impenetrable cliques, whether its through greek life, student groups, the people they live with, etc. At this point, its much too late for greek life. While there are tons of student groups, I have yet to find one that genuinely interests me, and even if I did, it would still be unlikely that i would form true friendships at this point, because it seems like everyone already knows everyone else, and i have no hope of entering their well established circle of friends. Parties and bars are pretty much just as hopeless for finding meaningful friendships. To be clear, Im talking about people to just chill with, have good conversation with, do social stuff etc. and most importantly, people who actually give a fuck that I exist. I know these people are out there, I just cant seem to find them, in spite of constantly putting myself out there and pushing myself to be social and going well outside of my comfort zone. two and a half years at this school and i have nothing to show for it but mediocre grades and debt and a major that doesn't even have any practical value. *please, no "first world problem" or "quit bitching" type comments, I simply want practical advise so that I can get the most out of what little time left I have left at Wash U.
