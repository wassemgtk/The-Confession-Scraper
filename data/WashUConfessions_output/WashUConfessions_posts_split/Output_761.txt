I was seriously considering becoming a WGSS major. But over the summer, a friend of mine showed me a bunch of interviews with high muckety-mucks in the field where they flat out ignore the results of rigorous scientific studies, and stating that their opinions and feelings were more important than science. I can't in good conscience continue in a field that ignores facts when it's convenient.
