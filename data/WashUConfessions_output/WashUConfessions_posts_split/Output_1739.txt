WashU is always praised for having amazing housing (and we do), but it's not all the great if you can't get into them. Our housing process is so screwed up and Wash U overaccepts so many students that I'm going to get forced into living in an off-campus apartment even though I don't want to. I thought as you got older housing was supposed to be nicer and it was supposed to be better. So much for that. Sophomores taking over the village and it sucks.
