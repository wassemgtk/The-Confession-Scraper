To all those people getting offers: congrats on your achievements, and I as your friend am happy for you. But just please be mindful of all those people who are still anxiously waiting for offers. It's really okay to post if you have gotten in your dream program and we'd love to know where you are going post-graduation but posting every single offer you've gotten seems too much.
