I'm a straight guy. This girl and I were hanging out in my apartment and she started taking off my clothes without asking me and started doing sexual stuff on me. I didn't ask for it and I really didn't enjoy it but I couldn't get myself to tell her to stop or push her away because I felt as though I was supposed to like it. I can't really stop thinking about it and it makes me feel kind of shitty but I don't know why.
