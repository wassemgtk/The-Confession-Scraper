When I first came here I really hated it not going to lie. Seeing all my friends at state schools having the time of their lives while I was in my room every night doing homework sucked, especially because as a pretty introverted person it seemed like I was kinda stuck in a never ending cycle. But I have to say, these past few weeks everything has been getting better.

Writing this one for all the other students out there who were in my position, don't sulk and regret that you're here working all the time. You have to force yourself to be happy, and when you're happy, good things start happening to you and you'll find yourself climbing out of the hole you thought you were in. Just be free and happy and there's nothing that can bring you down.
