The phrase "gently used" gives me stupid fits of giggles that only pyramids of acrobats that come tumbling down can rival.
I mean, did you tuck in your Physics textbook, or brush its teeth after the final?
Did you carefully place it inside your bag every single day after class, then serve it a mojito before you went out for drinks?
Was it truly gently used, or could you perhaps say, "fondled with care," "touched by the textbook angels," or if you were feeling particularly parental, "for sale by loving owner, who feels that this textbook deserves a good home--one that I can no longer provide due to the PTSD suffered by finals week."
