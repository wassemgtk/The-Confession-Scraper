I scrutinize the hell out of WashU with regards to how my tuition money being spent. It pisses me off to no end when I see petunia beds being planted outside when I'm getting shitty-ass internet in the library. I was also in the oh-hell-to-the-no camp with Bristol Palin debacle a few years back. Yet, I have no problems with WashU using my tuition money to bring a couple of porn stars to campus for sex week. None. Zero. Considering that I'm female, I wonder what this says about me.
