It is such a problem that the large majority of us are raised to mind our own business. I feel like we all (myself included, though I'm trying to do it less) turn our heads away from people we pass by walking to our classes. We're not even acknowledging each other's fundamental existence as fellow human beings. Once, I was walking down Forsyth and this other person was walking up Forsyth and we made eye contact and they smiled at me and it literally made my day.
