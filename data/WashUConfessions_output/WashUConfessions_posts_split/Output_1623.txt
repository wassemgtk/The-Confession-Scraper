People are taking to yik yak because the "wash u confessions guy would never post any confessions with honest criticisms of BA" . As a black student this is sad. We should be allowed to post what we like on here and it's your job as admin to do as much... I want others perspective even if it hurts and they need mine. This isn't a confession I just thought you should know.

Thing is, that isn't true. I haven't received any confessions about Black Anthology, and if there's something honest that needs to be said about it, I WANT it to be said (as long as it's respectful). 

But I also hope you understand that when people use Wash U Confessions to talk about delicate issues like this, this page takes heat from students and student groups. In those situations, I'll face consequences no matter what I do. If I give people a voice, I’ll also have to take blame for what they say, and if I don’t, I take blame for “silencing them”.  

Either way, I don't mind posting something honest and controversial if it opens up discussion. Being a scapegoat for misdirected anger really gets tiring after a while, but I realize it's part of the job.
