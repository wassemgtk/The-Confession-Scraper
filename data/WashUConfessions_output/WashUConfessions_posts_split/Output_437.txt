Here's to all of us who aren't WILD people: whether you get anxious in large crowds of people or you have a history of substance abuse or you choose not to drink for whatever reason or you don't like concerts or you don't feel like a part of the campus community or you don't have friends to go with or it's just not your thing. It's okay. I hope you join me in practicing some self care and getting off campus, forgetting anxieties, and knowing that there's life beyond WILD.
