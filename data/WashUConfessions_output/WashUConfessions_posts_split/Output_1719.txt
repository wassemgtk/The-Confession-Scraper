I just joined a sorority and am feeling a little out of place.  Everyone seems a lot "cooler" than me, and they want to go out more than I want to. In addition to that, it seems like a lot of people in my sorority already have friends in it and I don't. I know it's only been one day, but I don't know how long to wait to see if this will ever feel like I belong.
