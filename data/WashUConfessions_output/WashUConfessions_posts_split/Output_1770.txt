I confess that I lied about how many sororities I was asked back to because I'm ashamed of only getting two invites (and one was probably just because I'm a legacy).  And now I'm terrified that both of them will cut me and I'll have to go through another 3 and a half years alone.  I want to be in Greek life so badly, but the odds aren't too good at this point.
