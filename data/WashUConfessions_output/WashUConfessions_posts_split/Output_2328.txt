I confess that the lack of socioeconomic diversity on this campus is depressing. My parents could barely even afford to pay 1/3rd of my tuition even if ALL of their income went directly to my education.

I dread holidays. I dread going home and dealing with the drug use and occasional domestic abuse. I dread hearing my mother apologize to me every holiday that she can't give me more. I despise the sense of guilt that I have when I actually accept a gift that I know she could barely afford to buy- or used credit or a loan to purchase.

With the pissing contest of everyone complaining and having the world's largest problems, I don't think I can ever explain things like this to people on this campus.
