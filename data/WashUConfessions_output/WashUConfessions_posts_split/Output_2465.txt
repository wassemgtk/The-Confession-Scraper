I was a Wash U student in the past. I am an alum and I'm now teaching here. During my entire time (nearly thirty years) I've been disturbed by the way the University operates based on a corporate, hierarchical model where instead of ideas, education and values being of greatest importance, it seems issues related to money, increasing income, fundraising and positive PR direct the primary actions, policies and decisions of the University.

I attended an Ivy League university as an undergraduate. The education of students was the primary value ahead of other priorities (at least that was the case back then). Yes of course that university does a lot of fundraising, but it also encouraged and supported a much greater diversity in the expression of ideas conflicting with mainstream thought as well as ideas contradicting the administration's. There was an open atmosphere encouraging debate and intellectual investigation without concern for retribution and payback.

Here it seems carefully controlling the messages coming out of each school, each dean and each faculty member is more important than encouraging the free exchange of ideas. The university should much more actively support and encourage authentic, honest community interaction and support those in need. Outsiders should feel welcomde to visit campus and students should be encouraged to get to know the residents of the surrounding community.

By buying up so much property and pushing out independent building owners, the university has monopolized housing accommodations. Their policy of providing furnished apartments is a good thing for students however it has hurt many community businesses (viz., Good Works on Delmar). The university should take an active role in supporting local businesses rather than pushing them out in favor of maximizing savings through purchasing good through contracts with large scale vendors.

Wash U has taken on the role of Big Brother in circumscribing where students feel safe and where they ought not venture. Advice given to students like "Don't go north of Delmar or east of Skinker" is counterproductive, bad for the university population and bad for the community at large. This advice (purportedly based upon safety concerns) contributes to an 'Us vs. Them' attitude amongst students vis-a-vis the surrounding community.

Wash U treats its students, faculty and staff like it is an all-powerful money making machine we are beholden to and we should feel fortunate and humbled to have the rare, unique opportunity to serve this institution. The true, honest thoughts of members of the academic community are rarely heard. This is particularly true of faculty and staff who have the constant threat of a loss of privileges and/or loss of employment hanging over their heads.

In general, non-tenured faculty are paid far less and given relatively paultry benefits than they deserve. Many staff are similarly inadequately remunerated. For a university with such extensive financial resources, this situation is a disgrace. The amount of money charged by the university for faculty and staff parking is outrageous. Other universities do not extract such excessive fees from those contributing to the vitality of university community.
