Alright, so I've seen two different counselors at SHS and each one in my sessions has tried to refer me to some outside WashU mental health clinic, for 'more help'. I'm not sure if this means that I'm really that screwed up that they think I need twice as much help, or if washu mental health services are just that shitty and overwhelmed that they're ilke "yeah please go away somewhere else so we can free up our schedules"
