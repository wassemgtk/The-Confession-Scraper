Hi,

My name is (xxxx), I'm African - American, Female. I stayed in a shelter for some years of my life (The Salvation Army). I too grew up in some neighborhoods that a lot of people would avoid. My family needed government assistance for years of our lives, and it was not because my parents were lazy and didn't work. I am at Wash U because I worked hard so that my children can have more opportunity than I and my parents' had growing up. So #1341, please check yourself and refrain from making generalizations about the entire black community here at Wash U. You have not lived our lives. You do not know where we came from. You do not know what we've been through. Being at Wash U gives us the privilege of being able to speak for those who are not in a position to do so. To repeat what someone before me has posted, "it appears that blacks have a double edged sword against them: if you're black, poor, and left victim to police brutality, society says you are claiming false racism. And if you are bettering your reality, studying as a student at WashU, you are too privileged and too rich to fight against racism. So what are blacks to do?"
