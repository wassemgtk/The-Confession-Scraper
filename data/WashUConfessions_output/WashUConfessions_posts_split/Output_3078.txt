Oh, how easy it is to fall into the ruts formed by months of the daily grind of life, be it the class work, the extracurriculars, the worries about my future. Every day I forged habits, chained to my daily routine. Wake up, class, work, a drink here and there, but days molded into weeks, molded into months, molded into my year here at WashU. Today, something was different. As my roommate had left the week before, I was left with myself, my introspection... my curse? It wasn't neither the dreary weather nor my pressing schoolwork that led me to an epiphany. Working in my room, halfway through an essay due far too soon, I took a bathroom break, thanks to my four cups of coffee before noon. Like a machine, I made my way to the bathroom, and walked in. I can't say I made the conscious decision to do it, but my habit moved my arm, grabbed the doorknob, and shut the door behind me. That was when I had my epiphany. How many times had I gone through the same routine without stopping to ask myself the true meaning of my movements? I was a slave to habit, but the past tense "was" is my choice to change. Slowly I reached. It felt foreign. It felt absurd. How could I do this? How could I look my Catholic priest in the eyes ever again? Sitting there, I nervously opened the door. The feeling of liberty flowed in with the breeze from our central air. In an instant my perception of life changed and, breaking the bonds of my shackles of habit, I was jolted out of my routine like a Green Mile inmate. This? This is true freedom. I have to confess, it felt kinda weird though so I closed the door after a few seconds.
