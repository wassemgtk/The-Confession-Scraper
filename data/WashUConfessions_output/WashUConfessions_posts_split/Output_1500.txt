I was not offered an RA position and I am so hurt. A bunch of my friends got it, and I keep on seeing people posting these RA puns congratulating their friends facebook. I know I would have been a great RA  and I really really wanted to be one. I wish the RA application process wasn't so time consuming- I sacrificed a lot of my time to do all the essays and homework and application things. People keep telling me to not take the decision personally, but I do. I normally handle things well, but my heart really aches right now
