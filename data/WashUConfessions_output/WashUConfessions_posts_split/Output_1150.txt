The problem with being a girl in a hot dorm is that sometimes you just need to take off your shirt. The problem with casually taking off your shirt is going to the bathroom and hearing male voices come into your suite whilst barricaded shirtless in the commode. 37 minutes later, the male voices disappear and you are left with shame, sadness, and a realization that they all think you have digestive issues.
