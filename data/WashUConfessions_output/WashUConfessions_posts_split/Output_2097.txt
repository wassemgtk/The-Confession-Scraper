I'm not really sure what to think about this school, yet. All I do is watch Netflix, eat and watch Netflix. My roommate and I don't talk to each other, whenever he comes in to the room he just sleeps and I want him to stay up so we can talk. I like him and he's not bad looking either, but I find our relationship kind of awkward. I'm trying to think about how to bring it up to him that I want to get on better terms with each other and see how it goes from there. Like maybe we could get dinner or something together to actually be on a better relationship, too, but at this moment it's just like two strangers trapped in a living room of nothingness... Hopefully we could room together in the future too and maybe beyond college, but at this point I just want to fix our relationship in the present and maybe become something more. After it happens then I think college would finally start putting the metaphorical pieces of the puzzle together for me.
