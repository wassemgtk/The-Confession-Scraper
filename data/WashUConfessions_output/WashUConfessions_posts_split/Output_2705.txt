I haven't been on a date since high school. I haven't met someone I felt I had a prayer of dating since high school. I'm the super nerd that ends up watching ancient history documentaries while drunk on a Tuesday. Of course, when I put it that way it's totally understandable. Maybe it is my fault my confidence is so low. Sometimes I feel like girls don't like me. Then I remember that it kinda makes sense.
