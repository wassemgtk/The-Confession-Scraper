As a white student, I saw BA and loved it. It made me think hard about a lot of issues and the only thing I felt bad about after seeing it was how passive I've been in wake of Ferguson and other similar tragedies. I didn't feel bad for being white, or singled out, or anything else these confessions have been talking about. I was mostly amazed at the talent of the students involved and thoughtful about how I can be supportive for a group of people who have been discriminated against and marginalized for so long.
