It disgusts me that students at WashU are obsessed with proving how miserable they are. On a daily basis, WashU students love comparing how much work they have and wallowing in how difficult the classes are. On WashU Confessions, I've noted a recent trend of WashU students trying to prove that they aren't as rich as everyone thinks they are. Bro, if you aren't working 40 hours a week or trying to make money off CL ads because your parents deposit money in your account every month-- maybe just be thankful for what you have and stop being upset that everyone isn't recognizing how hard it is for your parents to send three kids to a tier 1 school? If your parents can afford that in the first place, then yes-- you are well off in comparison to most of the American public. There's nothing wrong with that. And yet... For some reason, students here are just obsessed with proving that their life is a struggle.

My confession? My life is fucking great. I work 40 hours a week, get good grades, don't complain about my work, do too many drugs for my own good, and I'm fucking happy. You all should try it some time instead of being pissed that people aren't recognizing how hard your life is as a college student at a top school in the nation.
