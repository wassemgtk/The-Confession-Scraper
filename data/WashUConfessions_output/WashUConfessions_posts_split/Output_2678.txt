I really like this WashU anonymous forum and feel like I've really gotten to know people through it and connect with them. I'm wondering if people would be interested in meeting in person. Of course you wouldn't have to say what (if anything) you've submitted, though you can if you choose. And anyone who uses WashU Confessions would be invited- whether you post, comment, or read.

I'm going to suggest a sort of "unofficial gathering" a week from now. I will be at Whispers at 5pm next Friday (9/26). Anyone who would like to come also is welcome to. No pressure, but feel free to come if you want. Maybe there might even be cookies!

=========================

I didn't write this submission, but I thought this was pretty cool. I've received a couple hundred requests in the past week that I've been admin, and I noticed how many of them are about how people feel alone.

Hopefully, this page helped people see that they aren't always as lonely as they may sometimes think they are. If people are brought together in real life because they found some common ground through this page, that's awesome and I fully support it!
