ot a lot to say about the Chancellor's comments on Wash U Confessions and Yik Yak, but I'll try to keep this as short as I can. First off, I want to thank the Chancellor for sending out an email and acknowledging the protestors and their efforts. 

But to set the record straight, I reject submissions that are meant to spread racism and hatred. 

I have only been asked a few times to delete a confession because someone didn't like the material in it, and I have responded to every single request. If someone feels like something has slipped through moderation, they can message me and I'll stop what I'm doing to respond to them. It often interrupts my personal life (and that of my significant other), but it's something I have to do because it is my responsibility.

The other day, I asked people to let me know if they had seen any racism or hate speech on this page. The only response I got was from someone who didn't like a protest-related confession about how the protests were making the anonymous submitter racist. I removed that confession and haven't heard about any other confessions that should be removed. 

From what I understand (please let me know if I'm wrong), the hate speech that the Chancellor referred to is on Yik Yak. The posts on this page should not be associated with whatever goes on in Yik Yak just because both are anonymous. 

Either way, it looks like a small number of people have run to the administration to have this page removed or taken down after the Ferguson protest confessions.

This page is meant to be a space for complete honesty, and to provoke conversation that might not otherwise exist. I understand that this doesn't make everyone comfortable, but I really do try to be open and accommodating about how this page is run. I think it is cowardly for someone to try to have the school administration censor or destroy Wash U Confessions simply because they didn't like a confession.

I understand that some of the material on this page may not make everyone comfortable. There are certainly posts pertaining to race and activism, sometimes with controversial viewpoints and opinions, but I filter out anything that I feel supports racism and doesn't encourage constructive dialogue and honesty. 

The Chancellor's email will not change how I run this page. I don't put up submissions that I feel are hate speech or meant to spread racism. If a post offends someone, they can message me and we can work things out. That's what I've done in the past, and that's what I'll continue to do. 

Some people have wondered why there were so many confessions against the protests. The truth is, that's just what people are sending in. I post confessions that I don't agree with because unpopular opinions deserve to be heard too. And without some form of anonymity, those unpopular opinions may be completely suppressed. 

My personal opinions really shouldn't matter, but if people would really like to know, I'll say it. I support the idea of protests against the injustices that we've consistently seen, especially in the past few weeks. Everyone has a different opinion as to what exactly is wrong, but I think it's clear now that SOMETHING is wrong. 

If people sent in confessions supporting the protests in school, I'll put them up, but the problem is that I haven't been getting a lot of those. So if you're really upset about the lack of confessions supporting the protests, please send one in! 

I don't have much else to say right now. If I think of something I forgot to say, maybe I'll update this post. 

And if there's anything that you want to say to me, please don't be afraid to message me. I don't bite!

Good luck on your finals!
