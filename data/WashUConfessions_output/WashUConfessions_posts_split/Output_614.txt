I feel like I'm at the point in my life where I should have had at least one significant romantic relationship. I know it's dumb and I shouldn't need someone else to make me validated or loved, but sometimes I wonder if I'm missing out on something and why I'm missing out. Maybe it's just circumstances or maybe I sabotage myself, but I'm just starting to feel like I should just get comfortable being alone.

~that's all folks~
