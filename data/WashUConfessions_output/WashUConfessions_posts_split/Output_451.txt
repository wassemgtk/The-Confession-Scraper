I watched Tarzan the other day, and it solidified what I've been thinking recently.  If you don't know, homeboy gets raised by Gorillas, runs around in a loin cloth, collects a hot British wife, and ends up swinging around on vines, eating, and boning Jane.

Watching it, I realized how great he had it.  Eat, sleep, sex, repeat.  No bills, no bullshit responsibilities, just taking care of the fundamentals.

Unfortunately, we're precluded from living that life style.  We're born into an inescapable society that's run on money, and we'll be here until we die.  I'm not really going anywhere with this, I just think humanity would probably be a lot happier if we had stuck with the hunter-gatherer life.  If I were to ask you, at any given moment, if you were happy, you'd probably (if you were being honest) say no.
