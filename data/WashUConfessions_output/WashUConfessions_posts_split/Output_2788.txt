I know that this isn't exactly a socially-acceptable opinion for a girl to have, but I really just want to have sex. With someone, that is... I'm tired of my hands or toys (or whatever), but it seems like no one will ever be interested in me. It's like everyone's already paired off, and I'm just the odd one out, suffering from some a good ol' fashioned case of female blue balls. A relationship would be nice, too, but me and my lonely libido would really like to just finally get it on.
