I get irrationally angry with people who chew with their mouths open and slurp their food. Like, if I have to listen to it for too long, I get so irritated that I want to punch them in the face. (And yes, I realize it's a bit ethnocentric of me because in Asia slurping noodles and soup shows that you are enjoying your food. I can't help it that the sound disgusts me.)
