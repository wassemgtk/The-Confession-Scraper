I saw the confession about a Top Care employee cat-calling another student.

I have a related confession:

Last semester, I was walking back to my dorm while reading a text from one of my parents with good news. I was smiling because of this and as I walked down the sidewalk, all of a sudden I heard one of the employees say "what are you smiling about, whore?" I was so shocked and upset, but we were the only two people nearby so I just walked quickly away trying not to look at him. The incident really upset me because up until that point, all of the WU employees had been so friendly and nice and this was just disgusting. I'm upset that I didn't speak up and even more upset that something happened to another student possibly by the same man.
