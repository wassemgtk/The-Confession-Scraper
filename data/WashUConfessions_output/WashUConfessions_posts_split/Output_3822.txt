During this one final exam, I needed to use the bathroom (I had pulled an overnighter followed by 2 cups of coffee) but was stopped by the TAs because apparently there had been a huge cheating scandal during last exam. I told the TAs that one of them(boy or a girl, it really didn't matter at the time) could follow me to the bathroom and choose a stall him/herself. To cut to the chase, I had to leave the exam room 30min early cuz my bladder was gonna burst. Somebody remind me, since when did WashU earn the right to stop us from using the fucking toilet?
