I fucking hate acapella. I'm not going to dispute whether or not they're talented, because clearly the groups here are very good at singing. But I swear to fucking Christ if I have to hear one goddamn acapella rendition of a current pop song I'm going to jump off a goddamn bridge. Like seriously, you fuckers can sing incredibly well on average but you all choose the same goddamn tired songs or themes instead of something actually interesting. Maybe the nature of acapella makes it difficult to cover anything more technically challenging than a Disney movie song, but if that's the case it might be worth finding a different genre of music to perform in.
