I am going to have to go through an academic integrity procedure when I get back in the fall because of a misunderstanding last semester. I don't know what I am going to do if I get placed on probation or expelled. What if this ruins me and I can't get into graduate school or can't get a job or internship? I am so terrified that this is going to put an end to everything. I have never been suicidal before but fear I might be if the result is too awful. I'm so scared. I need comforting words.
