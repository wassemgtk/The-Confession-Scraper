I'm a dude and I fake orgasms. Enough to where I lost count two years ago when I was dating a girl here. My depression leads to a low sex drive, but I don't want to disappoint/bore whoever I'm with by not having sex with them when they're horny. Plus I get bored after a long enough time with a girl and I don't feel like going at it for 20 minutes and feeling nothing.
