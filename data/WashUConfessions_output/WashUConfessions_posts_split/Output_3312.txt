This past week I've been sick (like most of this school). There were days were I could barely get out of bed, let alone concentrate on my classes. However, many of my teachers REQUIRE attendance and will punish you even if you miss because you're sick. So I went and I was miserable. Today I noticed a lot of my teachers were coughing, I guess that's what happens when you make a sick kid come to class.
