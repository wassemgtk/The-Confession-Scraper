The activists/social justice warriors here seem like they're in a constant pissing contest to see who can find the most things to be offended about. It changes the character of the school, it doesn't help actual issues get resolved, and it's demeaning to people who live through far worse manifestations of racism, sexism, etc etc than having an event whose name has another meaning that bothers you or having somebody use the wrong pronoun when addressing you. When women in Syria can drive and Christians in Iraq aren't being slaughtered, then come talk to me.
