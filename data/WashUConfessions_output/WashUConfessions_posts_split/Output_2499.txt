I confess that I'm just not about the whole rat race of internships and career fairs and job applications, and I kind of (unfairly) judge my friends for "selling out" to corporations for big salaries. I know it's because I feel like a loser myself for not being a part of the future six-figure set, but sorry that shit ain't me. It sucks that because college is so expensive everyone feels like they have to make big bucks immediately to justify it. What happened to pursuing what you're interested in? And I know all you can't possibly have a "passion for finance/consulting", gimme a fuckin break
