I keep wondering how student groups get away with racial discrimination.  One group, for example, explicitly says that it's open "exclusively to queer or trans students of color", in direct violation of university nondiscrimination policies.  Why is this kind of double standard allowed?  And why does my student activity fee go to groups that practice racial discrimination?  I was always taught that there is no acceptable form of discrimination, but the administration doesn't seem to realize that.
