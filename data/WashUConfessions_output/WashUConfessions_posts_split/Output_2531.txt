I thought for a while that I wanted to go to medical school, and I've completed all of the requirements, but now I'm starting to second guess my decision. It's becoming too late for me to change my mind, but I don't know what other career paths I would choose instead, and I'm starting to worry that I don't have a passion for anything. Any suggestions how I can figure out what other post graduate options I have?
