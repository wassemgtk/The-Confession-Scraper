Last fall my semester GPA was in the low 3.00 and this semester I didn't even get above 3.00. As a result, my cumulative GPA, which is in the mid 3.00, suffered greatly. Now I'm graduating in few days so I don't even have a chance to amend this and I will be applying for PhD programs almost as soon as I start my master's this fall, so I'm pretty much screwed.
