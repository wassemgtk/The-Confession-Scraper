I think I have a problem. I am about to meet up with two men (17 years my senior) who I met on craigslist for a threesome. I know it's creepy, sad, pathetic, and frankly dangerous, but I just can't help myself. I don't know if it's the adrenaline or if I crave the validation that comes with sex or if I really am just living out a fantasy, but I don't know how to stop.
