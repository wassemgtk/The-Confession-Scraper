I work five jobs while managing a full course load yet I still cant afford to 1) join a sorority 2) live with my friends 3) pay my tuition bill. I used to absolutely adore WashU, but the disparity between my finances and the finances of most other students is much more prominent than I realized. With each passing day, I feel more and more out of place.
