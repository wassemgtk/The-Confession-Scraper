I've been in love with the same girl for literally 10 years, and I want to apologize to every girl I've ever dated (including a few at WashU) for treating you unfairly and never lasting beyond the honeymoon phase because I was so hung-up on the other girl I could never last beyond the initial excitement of meeting you for the first time. You are all wonderful people, and hopefully once I pull my head out of my ass we can reconnect and build something real.

I sincerely apologize.

A tall male asshole
