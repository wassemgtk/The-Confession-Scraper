My family is very well off - somewhere in the range of top 2% to 5% of the country. And I've never dated a guy who came from the same sort of background. I know that guys often like to pay for the first date, but it doesn't seem like he should pay if he needs to work a job to pay for the dinner when I just need to go into my bank account. But it also feels awkward to bring up...
