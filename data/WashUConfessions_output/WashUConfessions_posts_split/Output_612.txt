Last year I was in an abusive relationship. In the depths of it, I felt despair and desperation that is indescribable. I felt like I couldn't be alive anymore. While on the phone with my parents one night, I began to have a panic attack. It went on and on, and they called my school. 

A team of EST showed up at my door and a girl knelt in front of me and began to walk me through some breathing exercises. There were 5 or 6 other people from EST crowded into my room, arguing about something else, and I must have been looking around wildly. The girl told me to look at her, and the pure, gentle kindness and concern in her face and demeanor helped me to calm down. When taking my sweater off to take my blood pressure, I saw her notice a bruise on my arm. I saw her expression and knew that she cared. After they determined I was suicidal, she made sure a female officer rode with me to the hospital. 

I probably wouldn't recognize her if I saw her today, because I was so panicky then, but I just wanted to find a way to thank her. The compassion and love she radiated in my darkest, most isolated time gave me some goodness to cling to, and I still remember it when I have hard days. I hope she sees this and knows I am so grateful.
