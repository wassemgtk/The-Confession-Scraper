My experience thus far at Wash U has been one of struggle. I can't tell if there is a real subset of individuals that judge me and others, who are doing cooler things, going out more, having more fun, or if such a community is imagined. Real or not, I feel as if I'm left out. I'm theorizing from the margins. I go to school here, where there is so much opportunity, and I am so thankful everyday for my education and a fighting chance at a good future, but I can't help but feel like there's nothing "for me" here. I want you to understand this cognitive dissonance: how can I have so much and yet so little? I yearn for a different kind of community, the one I thought Wash U actually was, but am not confident I'd find one by transferring. So I've been reflecting and I've reached one conclusion: Everyone just wants to be accepted. From the actions of the SAE pledges, to the girl "studying" in the library on the second floor. They just want to be cool, be noticed, be a part of a group. But I feel like we're all doing it in the wrong way. We put up fronts, we only choose to hang out with a set "elite", we put others down to feel fulfilled ourselves. Or, we are quiet, we are the ones who are constantly studying and stressed, don't have time for social activity, we feel left out, that something is wrong with us, that it is an individual problem and not a larger social issue. I think that's wrong. Like any other place on the face of the planet, Wash U has problems. I mean, heck, look at the tension caused between Greeks and GDIs on this page, alone. But that's not my point... my point is we—YOU—have the power to change. We've all taken the tests, gotten the grades to enter. We are all intelligent beings. I believe that each and every single student here is capable of more than they know, including capable of changing the social structure of the Wash U community. That's right. You, as an individual have the power to smile to a stranger, to strike up conversation with an old friend from freshman year, to let someone know that no matter what they're going through, no matter how hard things are, you will be there for them. Wash U is a hard place. I said it: it's fucking hard! And it has a tendency to get the best of us. My self included. But at the end of the day, it's the little things that really do mean so much. Let's get back to that. I've been dying to know: Students of Wash U, are you with me?
