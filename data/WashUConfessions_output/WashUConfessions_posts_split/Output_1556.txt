I really wish that Wash U would start making their policy for weed a lot more like their alcohol policy. Technically it's illegal, but they have the choice to overlook it as much or little as they want, just like underage drinking, but instead they choose to put on the same level as other drugs when in reality even alcohol can be much more dangerous. Every week, somebody I know gets way too drunk and hooks up with somebody they later regret, gets EST called on them, or has to go to the hospital for alcohol poisoning, but ain't nobody ever heard of a THC overdose. Meanwhile, I'm just chilling with some friends getting blazed, listening to music, and eating chips. The fact that I can get in more trouble here for a few grams of marijuana when I've been to school approved frat parties with enough alcohol to open a small bar kinda pisses me off sometimes.
