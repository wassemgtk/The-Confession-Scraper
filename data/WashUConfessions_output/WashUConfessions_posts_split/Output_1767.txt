I am a sophomore who rushed last year. This day in rush (philanthropy), I also got only two invites back. I felt embarrassed at first, but then you know what I realized? That at the end of the day, all that matters is where I end up. Trust me, a year later, I'm beyond happy with the sorority I'm in, and don't give two hoots about not getting a million invites. Yes, a million invites are good for the ego, but the way I see it is at the end of the day you're only in ONE chapter for the next four years. Make the most of the people who are interested in you!
