I confess that I have never rushed (and I don't intend to), but I urge all women rushing now to reconsider their choice to rush a sorority. 

I find sororities to be nothing but detrimental to the Wash U community. They're exclusive social groups based upon nothing: members aren't admitted based on merit or talent or even common interests. Women are admitted into sororities here based solely on if the "sisters" they talk to like them (more specifically: the way they look, the way they dress, and if it seems like this woman would be a fun partner with whom to go out and get drunk. In the worst cases, evaluation of whether they are "glitter" or "glue" also comes into play.). 

Getting into a sorority is completely arbitrary, yet women in Greek life put so much stock into which sorority they're in. There's some kind of unspoken ranking system that, in actuality, is as arbitrary as the system for choosing members! But somehow this hierarchy holds strong, and it's not hard to tell which sororities are regarded more highly than others by women in Greek life simply by listening to the tone of voice that Greek women use when naming one sorority or another. Stereotypes are ruthlessly applied once letters are revealed.

The whole institution, and especially the rush process, fosters low self-esteem and self-confidence in countless women at Wash U who didn't get into a "good" sorority or the sorority that they wanted to get into, and it perpetuates a superiority complex for women who find themselves, for no reason other than chance and perhaps their physical attractiveness, in a "desirable" sorority. Sorority life breeds cattiness and self-consciousness, not to mention ridiculous costs for dues and apparel (that inherently bias the system towards those who can afford it), all so you can brag about something that no one thinks is impressive after college. 

Once again, to women rushing this week, please just think about the things I mentioned above. You don't need a sorority to have a social life at this school. There are tons of student groups (based on real things like common interests) to get involved in that don't carry the potential torture and disappointment that can come with rushing a sorority. 

To the women who will rush despite my warnings, good luck. I hope you find a place that's right for you. But wherever you end up, please remember that 2 or 3 Greek letters do not define your self-worth. Only you and your actions can do that.
