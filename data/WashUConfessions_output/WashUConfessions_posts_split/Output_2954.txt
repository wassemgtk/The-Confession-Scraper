My sister is the person who shit in all the dryers at Yale. Unfortunately, I share the same disease as her and I can't help but shit and piss in weird places. Over my college career (i am a senior) I have pissed in the washing machine of every frat besides ZBT. I would have got ZBT but I couldn't find their laundry room because I don't think they have one.
