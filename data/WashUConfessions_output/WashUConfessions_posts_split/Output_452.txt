I hate when people at Whispers leave their trash on the table for others to clean up. But it's even more frustrating to see new people sit down and push the trash out of their way instead of actually throwing it out, and it just stays there until someone takes action or a worker goes out of their way to do it. Please just be respectful from now on and throw your stuff away.
