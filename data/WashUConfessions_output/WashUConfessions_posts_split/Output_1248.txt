So many people complain about the hook-up culture that you'd think it didn't exist. I'm tired of hearing how hard it is to "find a guy who wants a relationship and not hook-ups". There's an implied judgement, particularly on guys, that hooking up is negative and douchey thing to do (girls, unfortunately, get stuck with the slut label from those who are sex-negative). I'm a guy who has enjoyed a few very committed and long lasting relationships, and they were great, but I prefer to hook-up in between those. I separate sex from emotions very easily, and while the sex is more enjoyable when I care about the person, I don't see why it makes me a bad person just because I fulfill my sexual needs without. Complaints about "hook-up culture" imply that people who participate are shallow tools, when really I just know what I need now and that any relationship that comes to me will not come the same route that my hook-ups do.
