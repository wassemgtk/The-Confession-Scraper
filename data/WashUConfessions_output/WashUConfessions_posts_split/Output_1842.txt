I confess that I am religious, and, even more, Christian. I do not support slavery, and it is not because I am black; rather, it is because the Bible does not support it. I do not support the marginalization of anyone who is different than me because the Bible does not support it. I do not support the subjugation of women because the Bible does not either. The Bible is less of a rule book and more of a mirror, a mirror that shows us the state of humanity and our need for redemption from a being who loves us enough to offer it.  With the recent suicides that have been seemingly attributed to the Bible and its adherents, I thought this necessary because some, a minority of Christians, have used the Bible's influence to support their agendas (slave owners and sexists and hypocrites). No, I'm not claiming moral high ground over these other Christians, for I'm as messed up as they are.  I am simply bringing attention to a book that the public takes little time to understand, something that many think its followers commit also.
