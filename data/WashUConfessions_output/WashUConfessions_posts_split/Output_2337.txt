I'm a black student and I don't participate in organizations like ABS because I feel like any group centered on race indirectly encourages self-segregation among students. I acknowledge that many people think students of the same race may share common interests and experiences because of culture, but I feel like this inhibits people forming relationships outside their own race. I mean if you look around campus at any given time, it seems like minorities are traveling in cliques. I'm not saying it's bad to have friends your own race, but if your friendship circle is 75% your own race, I think you need to branch out more.
