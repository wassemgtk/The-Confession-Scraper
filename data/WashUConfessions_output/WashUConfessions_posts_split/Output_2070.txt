I recently found out that my boyfriend refers to me as an SJW behind my back. It really hurts because that means that all of our conversations about social justice, which have meant a lot to me, have been pointless. He is clearly minimizing a lot of struggles marginalized communities feel in society (myself being one of them), and probably thinks I'm too "politically correct" (as if that is even a thing). It's a little sad because I thought of him as someone really informed or at least really open-minded. I don't know if I should confront him about it or just give up on him altogether.
