I understand the need for WashU to build newer and nicer housing, but it's too expensive and puts students who aren't as well off at a disadvantage. The Lofts are super nice and all, but it's not fair that so many students were forced to live there even though they couldn't afford to. And maybe instead replacing traditional dorms with modern suite-style dorms, they could build new "traditional style dorms" for students who want to save money. Issues like this only contribute to the lack of socioeconomic diversity at WashU
