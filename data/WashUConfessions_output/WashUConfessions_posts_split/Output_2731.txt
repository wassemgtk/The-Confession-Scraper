So I watched the fat girl speech on Louie and frankly, I don't understand the point. Is it that I and other straight men (and lesbian women) am somehow obligated to be attracted to fat girls? I'm sorry but it doesn't work like that. Blame modern beauty standards. I and most people I know aren't particularly attracted to fat people, of either gender. Are some people attracted to fat girls? Of course! But just as I accept people who don't find me attractive (and I'm sure there are many), why can't you accept that people don't find you attractive?

Frankly, the whole fat acceptance movement is ridiculous...and I say this as a formerly obese individual. I became fat because of my personal decisions and I slimmed because of my personal decisions. What I'm about to say doesn't apply to the minority of fat people who have medical conditions. But for everyone else, accept that at some level, it is YOUR fault that you are fat. You have the ability to get into shape, but no one will force you to or require you to do so. With our obesity rates as high as they are, the last thing we need is to be telling people it's socially acceptable to be fat. It's not and it shouldn't be. It's bad for you, and it's bad for the society that has to cover your medical bills.

Now she does make a point about fat girls as opposed to fat guys that is valid. I'm a guy and I recognise that we have things easier in many ways. So that I have no issue with....what I do have an issue with is people acting like we, for some reason, have an obligation to be attracted to fat people.
