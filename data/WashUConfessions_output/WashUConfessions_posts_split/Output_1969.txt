It makes me nervous that the majority of the students here probably have fancy cars, eat fancy food, and use fancy credit cards....I heard somewhere that a certain percentage (I don't remember the figure) come from families that even pay full tuition. So a bill comes in the mail for $50,000 and Mom or Dad's like, "Honey, bring me the checkbook." How is that even possible?!
