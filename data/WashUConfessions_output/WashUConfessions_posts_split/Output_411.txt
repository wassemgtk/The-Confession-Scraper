I've withdrawn from 3 classes already because of severe depression and anxiety, and I thought that this semester would be better. My meds were on track, and I felt good. And then it all went south, again. I just withdrew from 2 more classes, and I feel like no matter how hard I try, this will just keep happening. I might have to take a medical leave of absence, but if that happens, I have no where to go. I have no friends, no one here to support me. I jut don't know what to do anymore.
