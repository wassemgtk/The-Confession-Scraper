My boyfriend and I will be attempting a long-distance relationship after we graduate in a few days. Although we successfully did long distance during the time I was studying abroad and the summer following, I am scared for this attempt at long distance because we will both be starting new jobs in different cities, with no exact plan of when we might close the distance gap. 

I am not normally someone to get sentimental over goodbyes, but I've had a connection with my boyfriend that I've had with very few people in my life. I fear that the distance will be the end to our relationship in the near future.
