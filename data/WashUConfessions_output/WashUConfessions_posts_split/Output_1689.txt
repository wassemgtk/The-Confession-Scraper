Hey WashU! My name is Rishil and I’m the guy behind Hangout Fridays. A while back, in response to a lot of the confessions about people feeling isolated on campus, I decided to make my own post about this idea I had (see post here: bit.ly/WU2038). I figured people enjoy making new connections and people love board games/video games so I thought we could combine them. The goal was to bring our community together with a game night on Fridays so people could make new friends while having fun.

I never thought my little idea would get such a enthusiastic response. Newly inspired, my friends Aarthi, Brett and I got Ursa’s Night Life on board, and now, I’m proud to announce Hangout Fridays is going to become a reality!

The first event will be happening on Friday February 6th at 9PM at Ursa’s, and you can join the event here: http://bit.ly/HFKickoff. Come for the games, stay for the friends you’ll make. Be sure to join our group as well: http://bit.ly/HFGroup
