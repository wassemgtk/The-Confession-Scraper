About a month ago, I passed by some people and overheard a girl say that doing laundry in her old building gave her PTSD. In context, she was joking about how terribly the machines worked. I'm not an aggressive person, but I really wanted to say something. I haven't thought about it in a while. But last night I woke up from a PTSD nightmare at 4:00 am and didn't sleep the rest of the night. While I knew there wasn't someone in my apartment, I kept imagining I heard footsteps and that I was about to be stabbed. THAT is PTSD. Don't joke around, please. You have no idea what it's like.
